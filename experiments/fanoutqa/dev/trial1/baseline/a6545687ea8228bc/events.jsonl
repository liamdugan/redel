Alongside special rules regarding COVID-19, UEFA also allowed two extra substitutions[7] and implemented video assistant referee (VAR) for the first time.[8]\n\n\nInitially, there were 13 venues chosen for the tournament but two were later dropped. Brussels was dropped in December 2017 after the city's Eurostadium was abandoned,[9] while Dublin was dropped in April 2021 because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain originally intended to use Bilbao as a host venue but later changed it to Seville to allow for spectators at matches.[10] UEFA chose Stadio Olimpico in Rome to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey, while Wembley Stadium in London was selected as a semi-final and final venue for the second time,[11] following the 1996 tournament at the original stadium of the same name.\n\n\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 bids\n\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\n\n\n\n### European format decision[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\n\n\n\n### Bidding venues[edit]\n\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\n\n\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\n\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final.

By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A.[31]\n\n\nUEFA held a videoconference on 17 March 2020 with representatives of its 55 member associations, along with a FIFPro representative and the boards of the European Club Association and European Leagues, to discuss the response to the outbreak for domestic and European competitions, including Euro 2020.[32] At the meeting, UEFA announced that the tournament would be postponed to the following year, proposing that it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021.[33] The postponement allowed for pressure to be reduced on the public services in affected countries, while also providing space in the calendar for domestic European leagues that had been suspended to complete their seasons.[34] On the following day, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the date change in the FIFA International Match Calendar. As a result, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, due to take place in June and July 2021, was postponed.[35] On 23 April 2020, UEFA confirmed that the tournament would still be known as UEFA Euro 2020.[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Spectator plans and venue changes[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Čeferin stated that in principle the tournament would take place in the twelve selected host cities. However, he did not rule out the possibility of reducing the number of cities, as three hosts were unsure if matches could be held under the new schedule.[38] The tournament venues and match schedule was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020.[39] At the meeting, UEFA confirmed that all twelve original host venues would remain as hosts for the tournament in 2021, and approved the revised match schedule.[40][41] However, Čeferin stated in October 2020 that it was still possible that the tournament could be played in fewer than the planned twelve host countries.[42] The following month, UEFA stated that it \"intends to hold Euro 2020 in the format and the venues confirmed earlier this year and we are working closely with all host cities on preparations\".[43] It was also announced that each host was discussing with UEFA and local health authorities on whether the venue could host matches at full capacity, between 100% and 50% capacity, at 33% capacity or behind closed doors. Each host city was asked to draw up two or three plans from the four options. The restrictions could also involve only local spectators to be permitted at matches. A final decision on which scenario would be applied individually at each venue was originally to be made on 5 March 2021.[44][45] In October 2020, it was announced that UEFA matches would be suspended from taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan until further notice due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.[46] However, this did not affect the planning of Euro 2020 matches to be held in Baku.[47] This restriction was lifted in December 2020 following a ceasefire agreement between the countries.[48]\n\n\nIn a New Year's interview, Čeferin said, \"Vaccination has started and I think we will be able to have full stands in the summer. For now, the plan is to play in all twelve countries. Of course, there are backup options in case a country has a problem. We are ready to organise competitions in eleven, ten or nine cities... and even only in one country, if necessary. However, I am 99.9 percent sure that we will have the European Championship in all twelve cities, as planned.\"[49][50] On 27 January 2021, UEFA met with the host associations to discuss operational matters, and reaffirmed the tournament would be held across twelve cities.[51] The deadline for hosts to submit their venue capacity plans was moved to 7 April 2021,[52] with a final decision on host cities and spectators to originally be made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 April 2021.[53] UEFA announced on the following day that Daniel Koch, the former head of communicable diseases at Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health, would serve as the tournament's medical advisor on matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[54] In February 2021, the Israel Football Association offered to stage some tournament matches in the country, which had a high rate of vaccination. However, this was turned down by UEFA, who reiterated their commitment to the twelve host cities.[55] In a March 2021 interview, Čeferin said, \"We have several scenarios, but the one guarantee we can make is that the option of playing any Euro 2020 match in an empty stadium is off the table. Every host must guarantee there will be fans at their games.\" UEFA subsequently stated that no host city would be automatically dropped should they decide to play matches behind closed doors. However, UEFA would need to consider whether it would make sense to play matches without spectators, or if these matches should be reallocated to other venues.[56] That same month, British prime minister Boris Johnson offered UEFA to host additional tournament matches in England should any venues need to be reassigned.[57]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2021, UEFA announced that eight of the original twelve tournament hosts confirmed their spectator plans, with stadium capacities ranging from 25% to 100%. Only Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome had yet to submit their plans, with each host originally given an extension until 19 April 2021 to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had guaranteed spectators for the tournament, and was therefore confirmed as a venue.[59] On 19 April, it was announced that another extension was given to the three remaining hosts until 23 April, when UEFA would make its final decision.[60] Due to the need to finalise ticketing details, host cities would have until 28 April to decide on whether to leave their spectator limits unchanged, or to upscale their allowed capacities.[61]\n\n\nOn 23 April, UEFA announced that Seville would replace Bilbao as tournament host, while the matches of Dublin would be reallocated to Saint Petersburg for the group stage and London for the round of 16.[10] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland was unable to receive assurances from the Government of Ireland and the Dublin City Council to allow spectators into the stadium.[62][63][64] Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said the sanitary conditions imposed by the Basque Government to host matches in Bilbao were \"impossible to comply with\", and thus would not allow for spectators to be present.[65] After being removed as hosts, the Bilbao City Council stated they held UEFA and RFEF \"directly responsible for us not staging this sporting event and the unilateral cancellation of our contractual relationships\", and threatened legal action for financial compensation.[66]\n\n\nAlso on 23 April, UEFA announced that local authorities had guaranteed \"a minimum of 14,500 spectators\" for the matches scheduled in Munich, which was therefore confirmed as host of four games.[10] However, both the regional government of Bavaria and the German interior ministry subsequently reiterated their position that there was no such guarantee, and admittance of spectators would depend on the actual pandemic situation at the time of the tournament.[67] A few days later, UEFA president Čeferin backtracked in an interview with a German newspaper, denying that UEFA had demanded guarantees for games with spectators, and conceding that \"the local authorities will decide before the games whether spectators will be admitted or not.\"[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Semi-final and final venue[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Italian President Sergio Mattarella speaks with the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson before the final\nWembley Stadium's hosting of both the semi-finals and the final was threatened over quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom that fans and 2,500 VIPs would be subject to. The Puskás Aréna in Budapest was considered as an alternative venue, as Hungary would have no entry restrictions for travel within the Schengen Area and could host the matches at full capacity.[70] A spokesman for the Hungarian Football Federation said the organisation was \"ready to host any high-level football event\".[71] However, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final, as the organisation and the UK government discussed quarantine exemptions,[72] but did not rule out a change in venue.[73] Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was doing \"as much as we possibly can\" to host the final,[74] while prime minister Boris Johnson stated they would try to make \"sensible accommodations\" for UEFA while still prioritising public health.[75] Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the final should be held in Rome due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom.[76] The following week, it was reported that officials and executives travelling for the matches would not need to self-isolate, though they would be subject to restrictions and required to remain in \"football bubbles\".[77][78]\n\n\n\n### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the tournament (with a sixth allowed in extra time).[7] However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time.[79] The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players.[80]\n\n\nAt the start of April 2021, UEFA also said they were considering allowing tournament squads to be expanded from the usual 23 players, following calls from national team managers in case of a possible COVID outbreak in a team, as well as to reduce player fatigue caused by the fixture congestion of the prior season.[81] On 27 April, it was reported that the UEFA National Team Competitions Committee had approved the expansion of squads to 26 players, subject to confirmation by the UEFA Executive Committee.[82] On 4 May 2021, the executive committee confirmed the use of 26-player squads. However, teams still may only name a maximum of 23 players on the match sheet for each tournament fixture (of which 12 are substitutes), in line with the Laws of the Game. These 23 must include three goalkeepers. It was also announced that after each team's first match, goalkeepers may still be replaced due to physical incapacity, even if the other goalkeepers from the squad are still available.[83]\n\n\nWater breaks were permitted so that players could drink from their own personal bottles.[84] Cooling breaks, first seen at the 2014 FIFA World Cup were also permitted for games played in higher temperatures.[85]\n\n\n\n### Special rules due to COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 May 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved special rules for the final tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe:[83][86]\n\n\n\n* If a group of players of a team were placed into mandatory quarantine or self-isolation following a decision from national or local health officials due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match will go ahead as scheduled as long as the team had at least 13 players available (including at least one goalkeeper). If fewer than 13 players were available (including at least one goalkeeper), additional players could have been called up to meet the minimum of 13 players required. In such a case, an equivalent number of quarantined players must have been definitively withdrawn from the 26-player list.\n* If a team cannot field the minimum required number of players due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match may be rescheduled within the next 48 hours of the original date of the match by the UEFA administration, subject to viable rescheduling options being available. Additionally, UEFA may reassign the rescheduled match to an alternative venue if deemed appropriate.\n* If the match cannot be rescheduled, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide on the matter. The team responsible for the match not taking place are considered to have forfeited the match and lost 3–0.\n* If any member of the appointed referee team has to be replaced due to positive SARS-CoV-2 test, UEFA can exceptionally appoint a match official of the same nationality as one of the teams or not on the FIFA list.\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying\n\n![](image)Team qualified for UEFA Euro 2020\n Team failed to qualify\n\nThere was no automatic qualifying berth, and all 55 UEFA national teams, including the twelve national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament.[87][88] As the host cities were appointed by UEFA in September 2014, before the qualifiers, it was possible for the national teams from the host cities to fail to qualify for the finals tournament. The qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland.[89]\n\n\nThe main qualifying process started in March 2019, instead of immediately in September 2018 following the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and ended in November 2019. The format remained largely the same, although only 20 of the 24 spots for the finals tournament were decided from the main qualifying process, leaving four spots still to be decided. Following the admission of Kosovo to UEFA in May 2016, it was announced that the 55 members at the time would be drawn into ten groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams, with the four participants of the UEFA Nations League Finals guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The qualifiers were played on double matchdays in March, June, September, October and November 2019.[90]\n\n\nWith the creation of the UEFA Nations League starting in 2018,[91][90][92][93] the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League was linked with Euro qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for the tournament. Four teams from each division that had not already qualified for the European Championship competed in the play-offs for each division. The winners of the play-offs for each division, which were decided by two one-off semi-finals (the best-ranked team vs. the lowest-ranked team, and the second-best-ranked team vs. the third-best-ranked team, played at home of higher-ranked teams) and a one-off final (with the venue drawn in advance between the two semi-finals winners), joined the 20 teams that had already qualified for the tournament.[93]\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nOf the 24 teams that qualified for the tournament, 19 were returning from the 2016 edition. Among them were Belgium and Italy, who both had recorded flawless qualifying campaigns (ten wins in ten matches),[94][95] defending European champions Portugal and world champions France, with Germany also qualifying for a record 13th straight European Championship.[96] Finland and North Macedonia made their European Championship debuts, having never previously qualified for a major tournament.[97][98] Scotland, a co-host of the tournament, qualified for their first major international tournament since the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and their first European Championship since 1996.[99] The Netherlands and Denmark returned after missing out in 2016, with the Dutch featuring in a major tournament for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[100][101] For the first time, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Wales reached successive European Championship tournaments.[102][103] Greece, winners in 2004, were the only former champions that failed to qualify, missing their second straight European Championship and third consecutive major tournament.[104] Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Romania failed to qualify after appearing in the 2016 finals.[105]\n\n\nNine out of eleven host countries managed to qualify for the final tournament. Denmark, England, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain all qualified directly, while Hungary and Scotland qualified only after winning their respective play-off path. Azerbaijan and Romania failed to qualify, with Azerbaijan failing to qualify from the group stage[106] and Romania losing in the play-off.[107]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team[A] | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[B] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group I winner | 10 October 2019 | 5 (*1972*, 1980, 1984, *2000*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Italy* | Group J winner | 12 October 2019 | 9 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Russia*[C] | Group I runner-up | 13 October 2019 | 11 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Group G winner | 13 October 2019 | 3 (2008, *2012*, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Group B winner | 14 October 2019 | 2 (*2012*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Spain* | Group F winner | 15 October 2019 | 10 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, **2008**, **2012**, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group H winner | 14 November 2019 | 9 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004, 2008, 2012, *2016*)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Group H runner-up | 14 November 2019 | 4 (1996, 2000, 2008, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) England* | Group A winner | 14 November 2019 | 9 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000, 2004, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[D] | Group A runner-up | 14 November 2019 | 9 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Finland | Group J runner-up | 15 November 2019 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group F runner-up | 15 November 2019 | 6 (*1992*, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group E winner | 16 November 2019 | 5 (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | Group G runner-up | 16 November 2019 | 2 (*2008*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Netherlands* | Group C runner-up | 16 November 2019 | 9 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| *![](image) Germany*[E] | Group C winner | 16 November 2019 | 12 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group B runner-up | 17 November 2019 | 7 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*, 2008, 2012, **2016**)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group D winner | 18 November 2019 | 4 (1996, 2004, *2008*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Denmark* | Group D runner-up | 18 November 2019 | 8 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | Group E runner-up | 19 November 2019 | 1 (2016)\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia | Play-off Path D winner | 12 November 2020 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| *![](image) Hungary* | Play-off Path A winner | 12 November 2020 | 3 (1964, 1972, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia[D] | Play-off Path B winner | 12 November 2020 | 4 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Scotland* | Play-off Path C winner | 12 November 2020 | 2 (1992, 1996)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** *Italic* indicates team from one of the eleven host associations.\n2. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n3. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** From 1960 to 1980, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia competed as Czechoslovakia.[108][109][110]\n5. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao.[10]\n\n\nOn 7 December 2017, it was also announced that the opening match would take place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, chosen ahead of Amsterdam, Glasgow and Saint Petersburg. UEFA decided that the opening match would feature Italy if they qualified.[9][112]\n\n\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n| ![England](image) London | ![Italy](image) Rome | ![UEFA Euro 2020 is located in Europe](image)![London](image)\nLondon\n![Rome](image)\nRome\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Baku](image)\nBaku\n![Saint Petersburg](image)\nSaint Petersburg\n![Budapest](image)\nBudapest\n![Seville](image)\nSeville\n![Bucharest](image)\nBucharest\n![Amsterdam](image)\nAmsterdam\n![Glasgow](image)\nGlasgow\n![Copenhagen](image)\nCopenhagen\n | ![Germany](image) Munich |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wembley Stadium | Stadio Olimpico | Allianz Arena |\n| Capacity: **90,000** | Capacity: **70,634** | Capacity: **70,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![Azerbaijan](image) Baku | ![Russia](image) Saint Petersburg | ![Hungary](image) Budapest |\n| Olympic Stadium | Krestovsky Stadium | Puskás Aréna |\n| Capacity: **68,000** | Capacity: **68,134** | Capacity: **67,215** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![Spain](image) Seville | ![Romania](image) Bucharest | ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam | ![Scotland](image) Glasgow | ![Denmark](image) Copenhagen |\n| La Cartuja | Arena Națională | Johan Cruyff Arena | Hampden Park | Parken Stadium |\n| Capacity: **57,600** | Capacity: **55,600** | Capacity: **54,990** | Capacity: **51,866** | Capacity: **38,065** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\nEach city hosted three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 or quarter-finals, with the exception of Saint Petersburg, which hosted six group stage matches, and London, which hosted host two matches in the round of 16. The match allocation for the eleven stadiums is as follows:\n\n\n\n* **Group stage, round of 16, semi-finals and final:** London (England)\n* **Group stage and quarter-finals:** Baku (Azerbaijan), Munich (Germany), Rome (Italy), Saint Petersburg (Russia)\n* **Group stage and round of 16:** Amsterdam (Netherlands), Bucharest (Romania), Budapest (Hungary), Copenhagen (Denmark), Glasgow (Scotland), Seville (Spain)\n\n\n### Group stage hosts[edit]\n\n\nThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength (assuming all host teams qualify), geographical considerations and security/political constraints. The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017. Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home. The following group venue pairings were announced:[9]\n\n\n\n* **Group A:** Rome (Italy) and Baku (Azerbaijan)\n* **Group B:** Saint Petersburg (Russia) and Copenhagen (Denmark)\n* **Group C:** Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Bucharest (Romania)\n* **Group D:** London (England) and Glasgow (Scotland)\n* **Group E:** Originally Bilbao (Spain) and Dublin (Republic of Ireland)\n\t+ Later changed to Seville (Spain) and Saint Petersburg (Russia)[a]\n* **Group F:** Munich (Germany) and Budapest (Hungary)\n\n\nThe following criteria applied to define the home matches of host teams within the same group:[113]\n\n\n\n* If both host teams qualified directly or both advanced to the play-offs, a draw determined which team would play all three group stage matches at home (including the head-to-head match), and which one played only two matches at home.\n* If one host team qualified directly, and the other failed to also directly qualify, the directly qualified host team played all three group stage matches at home, and the other host, if qualified, would play only two.\n* If one host team advanced to the play-offs, and the other was eliminated entirely, the host team in the play-offs, if qualified, had played all three group stage matches at home.\n* No action was necessary should both host teams failed to have qualified.\n\n\nIf a host team in the play-offs failed to qualify, the path winner would take the spot of the host in the match schedule and therefore would play the two or three matches based on the above criteria in the host city of the respective host that failed to qualify. The draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the draw for the play-offs).[114] In the draw, which was only necessary for Group B (Denmark and Russia), two balls were prepared, with the first drawn hosting the three matches.[115]\n\n\n\n\n\nAllocation of group stage home matches to host countries\n| Group\n | Host\n | Status of host\n | Draw\n | Number of home matches\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Three\n | Two\n |\n| A | ![](image) Azerbaijan | Eliminated in qualifying group stage\n | No\n | ![](image) Italy | None\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Qualified directly to finals\n |\n| B | ![](image) Denmark | Qualified directly to finals\n | Yes\n | ![](image) Denmark | ![](image) Russia |\n| ![](image) Russia | Qualified directly to finals\n |\n| C | ![](image) Netherlands | Qualified directly to finals\n | No\n | ![](image) Netherlands | None\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Eliminated via play-offs\n |\n| D | ![](image) England | Qualified directly to finals\n | No\n | ![](image) England | ![](image) Scotland |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Qualified via play-offs\n |\n| E | ~~![](image) Republic of Ireland~~[a] | Eliminated via play-offs\n | No\n | ![](image) Spain | None\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Qualified directly to finals\n |\n| F | ![](image) Germany | Qualified directly to finals\n | No\n | ![](image) Germany | ![](image) Hungary |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Qualified via play-offs\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In April 2021, Dublin was removed as a tournament host, with their group stage matches reallocated to Saint Petersburg, who were already hosts of Group B.\n\n### Spectator limits[edit]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament were unable to operate at full capacity. UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities. The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA. On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100%. The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity.[59] On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators. In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend.[10]\n\n\nMany of the matches did not see stadiums filled to their allowed capacity, with only Netherlands group stage matches that were played at the Johan Cruyff Arena seeing the stadium come within less than a thousand seats of being full. The match between England and Croatia saw an attendance of 18,497, compared to the allowed capacity of 22,500, with UEFA suggesting quarantine restrictions as the cause for the smaller attendance.[116]\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowed capacities of UEFA Euro 2020 venues\n| City\n | Venue\n | Standard capacity\n | Allowed capacity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amsterdam | Johan Cruyff Arena | 54,990\n | At least 33% (approximately 16,000), subject to possible increase[117] |\n| Baku | Olympic Stadium | 68,700\n | 50% (approximately 34,350), with no foreign spectators permitted other than citizens of participating teams[118] |\n| Bucharest | Arena Națională | 55,600\n | At least 25% (approximately 13,000) for the group stage and 50% (approximately 25,000) for the round of 16 match[119][120] |\n| Budapest | Puskás Aréna | 67,215\n | Full capacity, subject to spectators fulfilling strict stadium entry requirements\n |\n| Copenhagen | Parken Stadium | 38,065\n | 40% (approximately 15,900) for the first match against Finland and 67% (approximately 25,000) for the remaining two group stage matches and the round of 16 match.[121] |\n| Glasgow | Hampden Park | 51,866\n | 25% (approximately 12,000)[122] |\n| London | Wembley Stadium | 90,000\n | 25% (approximately 22,500) for the group stage and the first match in the round of 16, 50% (approximately 45,000) for the second match in the round of 16 and 67% (approximately 60,000) for the semi-finals and final[123] |\n| Munich | Allianz Arena | 70,000\n | 20% (14,000)[124] |\n| Rome | Stadio Olimpico | 70,634\n | At least 25% (approximately 17,659), subject to possible increase[125] |\n| Saint Petersburg | Krestovsky Stadium | 68,134\n | At least 50% (approximately 34,067), subject to possible increase\n |\n| Seville | Estadio de La Cartuja | 60,000\n | 30% (approximately 18,000)\n |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team chose a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. Unlike previous tournaments, each team could set up their base camp anywhere due to the pan-European format, without any obligation of staying in any of the host countries.[126]\n\n\nThe base camps selected by the 20 directly qualified teams were announced by UEFA on 27 January 2020.[127] The base camps of the remaining teams qualified via the play-offs were announced in 2021.[128]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Seefeld in Tirol, Austria\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Tubize, Belgium\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Rovinj, Croatia[a] |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Prague, Czech Republic[b] |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Helsingør, Denmark\n |\n| ![](image) England | Burton upon Trent, England\n |\n| ![](image) Finland | Repino, Saint Petersburg, Russia\n |\n| ![](image) France | Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines, France\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | Herzogenaurach, Germany\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Telki, Hungary\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Coverciano, Florence, Italy\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Zeist, Netherlands\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia | Bucharest, Romania\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Sopot, Poland[c] |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Budapest, Hungary\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | Novogorsk, Khimki, Russia\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Hurworth-on-Tees, England[131] |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Saint Petersburg, Russia[d] |\n| ![](image) Spain | Las Rozas de Madrid, Spain\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Gothenburg, Sweden[e] |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Rome, Italy\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Baku, Azerbaijan\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Bucharest, Romania\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | Baku, Azerbaijan\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Originally St Andrews, Scotland,[127] but moved due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Scotland.[129]\n2. **^** Originally Currie, Edinburgh, Scotland,[127] but moved due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Scotland[130]\n3. **^** Originally Portmarnock, Republic of Ireland[127]\n4. **^** Originally Castleknock, Republic of Ireland,[132][133]\n5. **^** Originally Maynooth, Republic of Ireland.[127]\n\n## Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania.[134][135][136][106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four. The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D.[137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020,[1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known.[115]\n\n\nThe teams were seeded in accordance with the European Qualifiers overall ranking based on their results in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. The following was the standard composition of the draw pots:[138]\n\n\n\n* Pot 1: Group winners ranked 1–6\n* Pot 2: Group winners ranked 7–10, group runners-up ranked 1–2 (11–12 overall)\n* Pot 3: Group runners-up ranked 3–8 (13–18 overall)\n* Pot 4: Group runners-up ranked 9–10 (19–20 overall), play-off winners A–D (identity unknown at the time of the draw)\n\n\nAs two host teams from the same group could not be in the same seeding pot, the UEFA Emergency Panel would have either switched one host team with the lowest-ranked team of the higher pot, or switched one host team with the highest-ranked team of the lower pot (based on the principle that the move would have minimal impact on the original seeding). However, no seeding adjustments were necessary.\n\n\nThe draw started with Pot 1 and completed with Pot 4, from where a team was drawn and assigned to the first available group. The position in the group (for the determination of the match schedule) was then drawn. In the draw, the following conditions applied (including for teams that could still qualify via the play-offs):[139]\n\n\n\n* **Automatic group assignments**: Host teams were automatically assigned to their group based on the host city pairings.\n* **Prohibited clashes**: For political reasons, UEFA set pairs of teams that were considered prohibited clashes. In addition to being unable to be drawn into the same group, non-host teams were prevented from being drawn into a group hosted by a country they clash with, even should the host not qualify. Only one prohibited clash, Russia / Ukraine, applied during the group stage draw. Other prohibited clashes among qualified and play-off teams were Kosovo / Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo / Serbia, but the teams in these pairs were all in the play-offs and in Pot 4 for the draw, and would not be in the same group; Kosovo / Russia was also prohibited,[140] but they also would not be in the same group due to play-off path pairings necessary for host allocation. However, these prohibited clashes are not excluded for the knockout phase.\n\n\n### Play-off path group allocation[edit]\n\n\nDue to the format of the play-offs, which made anticipating all possible scenarios impossible, the UEFA administration had to wait to solve issues relating to the final tournament draw until the completion of the qualifying group stage.[113] It was not possible for UEFA to prevent one of the play-off paths from containing two host teams, resulting in Romania (Group C hosts) and Hungary (Group F hosts) being drawn together in Path A. Therefore, the winner of this play-off path needed to be assigned two groups in the final tournament draw. To allow for this, Path A was paired with Path D (which does not contain a host), therefore providing a clear scenario for each possible qualified team. A draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the play-offs draw), which decided on the order of priority for the allocation of Path A to the final tournament groups.[115]\n\n\nTwo balls were prepared containing the names of the two groups hosted by the teams in question (Group C and Group F for Romania and Hungary, respectively). The first ball drawn determined the group (\"priority group\") that was allocated to Path A, with the exception of the host team of the second ball drawn (\"non-priority group\") winning Path A. In the draw, Group F was selected as the priority group, resulting in the following possible outcomes:\n\n\n\n* **Path A is won by Bulgaria, Hungary or Iceland**: The winner of Path A will enter Group F, and the winner of Path D will enter Group C.

However, the maximum number of players permitted on the match sheet for each tournament fixture remained 23.[83] Each nation's squad, which had to include three goalkeepers, was submitted at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament (by 1 June 2021). If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player;[1] however, goalkeepers could still be replaced after their team's first match due to physical incapacity.[83]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 September 2018, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time at the UEFA European Championship.[8] On 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration, including the possibility of a team of South American match officials appointed for the group stage of the tournament.[142]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2021, UEFA announced the 19 refereeing teams for the tournament.[143] This included Argentine referee Fernando Rapallini and his assistants, who were the first South American officials to be selected for the European Championship as part of UEFA's referee exchange programme with CONMEBOL. A group of Spanish officials were similarly selected for the 2021 Copa América.[144]\n\n\nA refereeing team of nine officials was appointed for each match. The team of five at the stadium consisted of a referee, two assistant referees, a fourth official and a reserve assistant referee.[144] In addition, four video match officials were located at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. This team consisted of a video assistant referee (the lead video official who was the main point of contact with the referee), an assistant video assistant referee (AVAR 1, who concentrated on following the match), an offside VAR (AVAR 2, who reviewed all potential offside situations) and a support VAR (AVAR 3, who acted in a coordination capacity).[145] The tournament used the 2021 Laws of the Game, which came into force on 1 July but could be introduced in competitions that began immediately beforehand.[146]\n\n\n\n\n\nRefereeing teams\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistant referees\n |

Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony took place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, on 11 June 2021 at 20:35 (CEST) prior to the first match of the tournament. Italian opera tenor Andrea Bocelli performed the song \"Nessun dorma\".[148] Martin Garrix, Bono and the Edge also featured, performing the tournament's official anthem, \"We Are the People\". The performance was a virtual one amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and was filmed at motion-control studios in London and at the Stadio Olimpico to recreate the stadium environment in 3D.[149]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Result of teams participating in UEFA Euro 2020 |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winner\n Runner-up\n | Semi-finals\n Quarter-finals\n | Round of 16\nGroup stage\n |\n\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward.[150][151] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw.[152] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021.[153][154] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e. from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday). On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced.[155]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\n*Times are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA. If the venue was located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[1]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings.[a] If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 applied;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. Higher number of wins in all group matches;[b]\n8. If on the last round of the group stage, two teams were facing each other and each had the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finished level in their match, their ranking was determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion was not used if more than two teams had the same number of points.);\n9. Lower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);\n10. Higher position in the European Qualifiers overall ranking.\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** If there was a three-way tie on points, the application of the first three criteria could only break the tie for one of the teams, leaving the other two teams still tied. In this case, the tiebreaking procedure was resumed, from the beginning, for the two teams that were still tied.\n2. **^** This criterion could only break a tie if a point deduction were to occur, as multiple teams in the same group could not otherwise be tied on points but have a different number of wins.\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Italy (H) | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 0\n | +7\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Wales | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 2\n | +1\n | 4[a] |\n| 3\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 5\n | −1\n | 4[a] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Turkey | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | 8\n | −7\n | 0\n |  |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Wales 1–1 Switzerland).

The logo depicted the Henri Delaunay Trophy surrounded by celebrating fans on a bridge, which, according to UEFA, represented how football connects and unifies people.[223][224]\n\n\nEach individual host city also had their own unique logo. The rectangular logos featured the text *UEFA EURO 2020* on the top, the city name above the text *host city* on the bottom (all in uppercase), the main tournament logo on the left and a local bridge on the right. Each logo existed in English, along with variations in the local language when applicable. The logos were unveiled from September 2016 to January 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogos of host cities\n| Host city\n | Date announced\n | Bridge\n | Other language\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| London | 21 September 2016[a] | Tower Bridge | —\n | [224] |\n| Rome | 22 September 2016\n | Ponte Sant'Angelo | Italian\n | [225] |\n| Baku | 30 September 2016\n | Baku cable-stayed bridge | Azerbaijani\n | [226] |\n| Bucharest | 15 October 2016\n | Basarab Overpass | Romanian\n | [227] |\n| Glasgow | 25 October 2016\n | Clyde Arc | —\n | [228] |\n| Munich | 27 October 2016\n | Wittelsbacherbrücke | German\n | [229] |\n| Copenhagen | 1 November 2016\n | Circle Bridge | Danish\n | [230] |\n| Budapest | 16 November 2016\n | Széchenyi Chain Bridge | Hungarian\n | [231] |\n| Amsterdam | 16 December 2016\n | Magere Brug | Dutch\n | [232] |\n| Saint Petersburg | 19 January 2017\n | Palace Bridge | Russian\n | [233] |\n| Seville | —\n | Alamillo Bridge | Spanish\n | [234] |\n\n\n1. **^** As part of the main logo launch event.\n\n\n\nLogos of removed host cities\n| Host city\n | Date announced\n | Bridge\n | Other language(s)\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dublin | 24 November 2016\n | Samuel Beckett Bridge | Irish\n | [235] |\n| Brussels | 14 December 2016\n | Pont Sobieski [fr] | Dutch, French\n | [236] |\n| Bilbao | 15 December 2016\n | San Antón Bridge | Spanish\n | [237] |\n\n\nThe official slogan of the tournament was \"Live It. For Real.\" The slogan was meant to encourage fans to see the matches live in the stadiums across Europe.[238]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official match ball \"Uniforia\"\nOn 6 November 2019, UEFA announced that the \"Uniforia\" by Adidas would be the tournament's official match ball. Predominantly white, the ball featured black strokes with blue, neon and pink stripes with panels designed to resemble a hashtag, and had the coordinates of twelve cities which hosted the finals (including Dublin and Bilbao, which were later removed as the host cities). The name was derived from a portmanteau of \"unity\" and \"euphoria\".[239]\n\n\nA special variation named \"Uniforia Finale\" was launched on 5 July 2021, to be used in both semi-finals and the final match. The ball had a silver base, a different colour arrangement, and Wembley Stadium's coordinates (51° 33' 21,5\" N, 0° 16' 46,4\" W) written on the ball.\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adidas Uniforia Finale, which was used in the semifinals and final match\nThe official mascot of the tournament, *Skillzy*, was unveiled on 24 March 2019. The character was inspired by freestyle football, street football, and panna culture.[240]\n\n\n\n### Official song[edit]\n\n\nMain article: We Are the People (Martin Garrix song)\n\nOn 19 October 2019, Dutch DJ and music producer Martin Garrix was announced as the official music artist of the tournament.[241] He produced the official song of the tournament, as well as the walkout music preceding matches and the television broadcast music.[242] The official song, \"We Are the People\", featured Bono and the Edge from Irish rock band U2 and was released on 14 May 2021.[243][244] It was first performed in full at a virtual opening ceremony at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship video games\n\nThe game was released by Konami as a free DLC on *eFootball PES 2020* in June 2020, and on the *eFootball PES 2021 Season Update* on launch day. It included the official kits and player likenesses for all 55 officially licensed UEFA teams. The update also included five out of eleven venues of the tournament, as well as the official match ball.[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA had the following sponsorship partners:[247]\n\n\n\n* \"National Team Football Official Sponsors\": Alibaba Group (Alipay brand),[248] Booking Holdings,[249] FedEx,[250] Gazprom,[251] Hisense,[252] and Volkswagen.[253]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Sponsors\": Coca-Cola,[254] Heineken,[255] Qatar Airways,[256] Takeaway.com,[257] TikTok,[258] and Vivo Mobile.[259]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Licensees\": Adidas, Hublot, IMG, Konami, and Panini.\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 broadcasting rights\n\nThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the Expo Haarlemmermeer in Vijfhuizen, Netherlands.[260]\n\n\n\n## Incidents and controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Ukraine kit[edit]\n\n\nThe team of Ukraine presented its shirt for the championship, decorated with a map of national borders, including Crimea. The peninsula was annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014 but is still considered part of its territory by Ukraine and the United Nations. The shirt carried the slogan \"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that it was a Ukrainian nationalist slogan that imitated a Nazi one. Russian Deputy Dmitry Svishchev called UEFA to intervene because the shirt was \"totally inappropriate\".[261] UEFA said there was no dispute for the map of Ukraine, as it reflected the borders recognized by the United Nations, while it ordered the removal of the phrase, as \"specific combination of the two slogans is deemed to be clearly political in nature, having historic and militaristic significance.\"[262]\n\n\n\n### Collapse of Christian Eriksen[edit]\n\n\nThe Denmark vs Finland match in Group B was suspended minutes prior to half-time after Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest. He was given immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, then transferred to Rigshospitalet and stabilised, with the match resuming by the decision of the Danish team later that evening.[263][264][265]\n\n\nFollowing the match, the Danish team stated that it was unfair they had to decide to continue playing the match.[266] Former Danish international Peter Schmeichel said that the Danish team had been given the options to finish the game that same day, finish the game the next day at 12 pm, or forfeit the game and lose 3–0. UEFA denied that either team had been threatened with a forfeit.[267]\n\n\nBritish broadcaster BBC received over 6,000 complaints over the UEFA video-feed broadcasting live images of Eriksen receiving CPR on the pitch.[268][269] Eriksen was later fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and returned to playing with Brentford eight months later.[270]\n\n\n\n### Marko Arnautović insult[edit]\n\n\nIn the Austria vs North Macedonia match on 13 June 2021, Austrian player Marko Arnautović insulted Macedonian player Ezgjan Alioski and his family after his goal to make it 3–1. Arnautović is of Serbian descent, and Alioski is of Albanian descent; both countries have been in conflict over Kosovo for decades. The Football Federation of North Macedonia lodged a complaint with UEFA after the game, demanding a clear penalty. The UEFA Control Committee then opened an investigation, Arnautović was banned from the next game by UEFA for \"insulting another player\", and was unable to play in Netherlands vs Austria, the group's second game.[271]\n\n\n\n### Removing marketing drink bottles[edit]\n\n\nAt a press conference before Hungary vs Portugal on 14 June 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo removed Coca-Cola bottles from the table and then held a water bottle in front of the camera to highlight that water, healthier than Coca-Cola, is his ideal drink;[272][273] it was thought that Ronaldo's actions were behind the collapse of Coca-Cola market value, but it was later found it had nothing to do with it.[274][275] After France vs Germany, France's Paul Pogba, a practising Muslim,[276] moved bottles of non-alcoholic Heineken beer from the table at a press conference.[277] After these two actions, UEFA spoke with each team participating in the European Championship, in which it pointed out the importance of sponsors. UEFA also said that if it happened again, then punishments would be given out to those players.[278]\n\n\n\n### Greenpeace protest[edit]\n\n\nIn the run-up to the France vs Germany on 15 June 2021 in Munich, a man with a paramotor got stuck on a fixed rope during a flight over the stadium, fell into a descent, grazed the spectator stands, and landed on the pitch. In the action planned as a protest by Greenpeace against car manufacturer Volkswagen, in which only a large ball with a label was supposed to be thrown onto the field, two people in the stands suffered head injuries and had to receive medical care.[279] The campaign provoked strong criticism due to the endangerment of viewers; UEFA criticised it as a \"reckless and dangerous action\" that could have had serious consequences for many people.[280] The German Football Association (DFB), the Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder, and other politicians made similar statements, and Greenpeace apologised. A total flight ban was issued over the stadium for the duration of the European Championship. The Munich police are investigating the paramotor pilot for dangerous bodily harm, trespassing, and violation of the Aviation Act.[281][282]\n\n\n\n### Captain's rainbow armband[edit]\n\n\nIn connection with Pride Month, the German team used related symbolism. Team captain Manuel Neuer wore a captain's armband in rainbow colours in a friendly against Latvia on 7 June and continued to wear the armband in Germany's subsequent games. An investigation by UEFA followed during the group stage of the tournament. They assessed the armband as a \"team symbol for diversity\" and \"a good cause.\" UEFA decided not to impose a penalty because of the rule broken by Neuer, which obliges team captains to wear UEFA captains' armbands.[283]\n\n\n\n### Illumination of the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lighting of the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours (2016)\nBefore the Germany vs Hungary group stage match on 23 June 2021, Munich City Council applied to UEFA to have the façade of the stadium illuminated in rainbow colours as a sign of diversity and tolerance. Since the project was understood as a protest against a law passed by the Hungarian Parliament that, according to its critics, restricts the \"information rights\" of young people with regard to homosexuality and gender transitioning,[284] UEFA rejected the application with reference to its status as a politically and religiously neutral organisation.[285] After initially approving the illumination of the stadium in rainbow colours, the German Football Association joined the UEFA position. The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter criticised these decisions and described the illumination not as a political measure but as what he called a sign of humanity and a symbol for the acceptance of equality between people.[286] In contrast, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó welcomed UEFA's decision \"not to be involved in a political provocation against Hungary.\"[287]\n\n\nNumerous reactions from German political parties condemned the ban by UEFA. Nationwide, other football stadiums, such as those in Cologne, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Wolfsburg, Berlin, and Darmstadt, were to be illuminated in the rainbow colours. Munich illuminated the Town Hall, Olympiaturm, and the wind turbine right next to the football arena. In the Netherlands, the Erasmusbrug, Ziggo Dome, tower in Alphen aan den Rijn and several town halls were illuminated.[288][289] In protest against the UEFA ban, several large German corporations also changed their company logos on social media sites to rainbow colours. This included BMW, Volkswagen, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Sparkasse, and HypoVereinsbank.[290] CSD Germany announced that they would be distributing up to 11,000 flags, 5,000 cardboard boxes, and 4,500 stickers with the words \"Don't Kick LGBTIQ Rights\" to fans in front of the stadium. On 23 June, UEFA itself also changed their logo in social media to include a rainbow background, with a statement that \"the rainbow is not a political symbol, but a sign of our firm commitment to a more diverse and inclusive society.\"[291] As a counter-action, Gábor Kubatov, president of the Hungarian club Ferencváros and vice-president of Fidesz, called for stadiums in Hungary to be illuminated in the Hungarian national colours. In addition, Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán cancelled a visit to Munich in protest.[292][293]\n\n\n\n### Confiscation of rainbow flag in Baku[edit]\n\n\nSee also: LGBT rights in Azerbaijan\n\nOn 3 July 2021, UEFA began an investigation after two fans had a rainbow flag confiscated during the quarter-final match between the Czech Republic and Denmark at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Azerbaijan.[294][295] Photos emerged while the match was being played, showing two stewards taking a rainbow flag, waved in support of the LGBTQ+ community, being taken.[296] In a statement, UEFA said: \"UEFA never instructed stewards in Baku – or in any other stadium – to confiscate rainbow flags. We are currently investigating what happened and we will of course contact the UEFA delegate, UEFA security officer and local authorities to clear this up. The rainbow flag is a symbol that embodies UEFA core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone and UEFA has ensured that the flag was returned to the supporter.\"[297]\n\n\n\n### England vs Denmark incidents[edit]\n\n\nIn the 104th minute in the England vs Denmark semi-final match, on-field referee Danny Makkelie awarded a penalty kick to England after adjudging Danish defender Joakim Mæhle to have fouled English player Raheem Sterling in the penalty area. Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel stopped Harry Kane's penalty kick, but Kane was able to score from the rebound. In a press conference shortly after the match, Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand expressed his dissatisfaction with the penalty decision,[298] as well as the fact that there were two balls on the pitch when the foul was given.[299] Non-English commentators such as Arsène Wenger, José Mourinho, and Dietmar Hamann criticised the penalty decision during and after the match, arguing that the penalty should not have been awarded when checked by VAR, while Roy Keane described it as \"very, very soft\".[300][301] Former England forward Alan Shearer also described the penalty decision as \"soft\", and said he would be \"pretty angry if that penalty was given against England\", while former England full-back Gary Neville said: \"If we're being fair, you'd be absolutely devastated if you lost to a penalty like that.\" Match official and current ESPN rules analyst Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the UEFA Euro 2016 Final, said he would not have awarded a penalty kick for a tackle of this sort \"in such a key moment.\"[302][303]\n\n\nThe *Birmingham Mail* claimed Denmark disrupted the English wall during a critical free kick that led to the opening goal of the match, and that Denmark's goal should have been disallowed as a result. According to the FIFA Laws of the Game, during a free kick, attackers must be within one metre from the defending team's wall, a rule that was violated by the Danish players who were accused of blocking goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's vision.[304]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, a day after the match, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the English Football Association over a laser pointed at Danish goalkeeper Schmeichel just before the decisive penalty, booing when the Danish national anthem was played, and use of pyrotechnics.[305][306][307][308] The laser pointer first came to the notice of both the Football Association and UEFA in the first half of extra time but a search for the culprit was unsuccessful.[309] The Football Association were fined £25,630 (€30,000) for the three offences.[310][311][312]\n\n\n\n### Italy vs England incidents[edit]\n\n\n#### Storming of Wembley stadium before final[edit]\n\n\nOn the day of the UEFA Euro 2020 Final between Italy and England, thousands of England fans gathered at Wembley Stadium throughout the morning and afternoon, which prompted the police to urge anyone without tickets to not travel there.[313] Two hours before the final, footage showed hundreds of fans fighting with stewards and police as they attempted to force their way past barriers to get into the stadium.[314][315] Around 400 people managed to gain access to the stadium, in block 104, without paying for a ticket.[316] Huge crowds gathered in Leicester Square throwing bottles and other objects, and Trafalgar Square, where a ticketed fan zone was set up.[317] As a result of the violence and disorder, a total of 86 people were arrested by police, 53 of which were made at Wembley stadium for a number of offences, including public order breaches, assault, drunk and disorderly conduct and criminal damage.[318][319][320] 19 police officers were injured, including one who lost a tooth and another suffered a broken hand.[316][321]\n\n\nOn 12 July 2021, a day after the final, the Football Association said it would conduct a full review into how people without tickets were able to breach security and gain access to Wembley stadium for the Euro 2020 final.[322][323][324] On 13 July 2021, following the chaotic scenes, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the Football Association for the invasion of the pitch by an England supporter, throwing of objects by supporters, disturbances during the Italian national anthem, and the use of pyrotechnics.[325][326][327]\n\n\nOn 18 October 2021, UEFA punished the Football Association (FA) for the unrest at the final by ordering England to play their next UEFA competition match behind closed doors.[328] UEFA also imposed a ban for a second game, suspended for two years, and fined the FA £84,560 (€100,000) for the lack of order and discipline inside and around the stadium, for the invasion of the field of play, for the throwing of objects and for the disturbances during the national anthems.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Online racist abuse after final[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: UEFA Euro 2020 Final § Player abuse online\n\nEngland football players Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho, and Marcus Rashford were subjected to racist abuse online after missing penalties in England's Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy.[330][331] The three football players took the last three penalties, two of which were saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, during England's 3–2 loss on penalties on Sunday 11 July 2021, and were all immediately targeted with racist language and emojis on their social media accounts.[332][333]\n\n\nThe Football Association condemned the racist abuse and said it was \"appalled by the online racism\" aimed at some players on social media.[334] In a statement, it said: \"We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.\"[335]\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Police began investigating the abuse and said on Twitter that the abuse was \"totally unacceptable\" and it would not be tolerated.[336] British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer, and the Football Association president Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, also condemned the racist abuse.[337][338]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament was admired for its high scoring,[339][340] with 2.78 goals per game a record for any European Championship since the introduction of the group stage in 1980.[341] Two of the highest-scoring games at the European Championship occurred during the tournament. 18 goals scored across four group stage matches on 23 June 2021 were a tournament record,[342] whereas 14 goals scored in the Croatia vs Spain and France vs Switzerland matches on 28 June 2021 made it the highest-scoring day in knockout stages and the second highest overall.[343]\n\n\nThe \"light touch\" officiating was also well received, with a perception that referees aimed to keep play moving.[344][345]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2018–20\". *UEFA.com*.

Alongside special rules regarding COVID-19, UEFA also allowed two extra substitutions[7] and implemented video assistant referee (VAR) for the first time.[8]\n\n\nInitially, there were 13 venues chosen for the tournament but two were later dropped. Brussels was dropped in December 2017 after the city's Eurostadium was abandoned,[9] while Dublin was dropped in April 2021 because there was no guarantee that spectators could attend. Spain originally intended to use Bilbao as a host venue but later changed it to Seville to allow for spectators at matches.[10] UEFA chose Stadio Olimpico in Rome to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey, while Wembley Stadium in London was selected as a semi-final and final venue for the second time,[11] following the 1996 tournament at the original stadium of the same name.\n\n\nThe tournament was well received by fans and commentators, with the most goals per game in a European Championship since the introduction of the group stage, and only two goalless games. The refereeing style was also praised, with a conservative use of VAR and quick decisions made on the pitch.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 bids\n\nWhile some countries such as Belgium,[12] Bulgaria and Romania,[13] Germany,[14][15] Hungary and Romania,[16] Ireland, Scotland, and Wales,[17] the Netherlands,[18] and Turkey[19] had already expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament, then-UEFA president Michel Platini suggested at a press conference on 30 June 2012, a day before the UEFA Euro 2012 Final, that instead of having one host country, or joint hosting by multiple countries, the tournament could be spread over \"12 or 13 cities\" across the continent, as was done for the UEFA European Under-17 Championship's elite round, where each of the seven groups was hosted by a different country.[20]\n\n\n\n### European format decision[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 December 2012, UEFA announced the tournament would be held in multiple cities across Europe to mark the 60th anniversary of the tournament.[21][22] The selection of the host cities did not guarantee an automatic qualifying berth to the national team of that country. UEFA reasoned that the pan-European staging of the tournament was the logical decision at a time of financial difficulty, such as the European debt crisis.[23][24] Reaction to UEFA's plan was mixed across Europe.[25] Critics cited the expanded format (from 31 matches featuring 16 nations to 51 featuring 24) and its associated additional costs as the decisive factor for only one nation (Turkey) having put forward a serious bid.[26]\n\n\n\n### Bidding venues[edit]\n\n\nThe final list of bids was published by UEFA on 26 April 2014, with a decision on the hosts being made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 September 2014. There were two bids for the Finals Package (of which one was successful, marked with dark green for semi-finals and final) and 19 bids for the Standard Package (of which 12 were initially successful, marked with light green for quarter-finals and group stage, and yellow for round of 16 and group stage); Brussels, marked with red, were initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 7 December 2017.[27][11][28] Dublin, marked in red, was initially selected but removed from the list of venues by UEFA on 23 April 2021. On the same day, UEFA also announced the matches in Spain would be moved from Bilbao to Seville.[10]\n\n\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and round of 16\n\nSuccessful bid for group stage and quarter-finals\n\nSuccessful bid for semi-finals and final.

By 13 March 2020, upcoming UEFA competition fixtures were postponed, while major European leagues were suspended, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, Premier League, and Serie A.[31]\n\n\nUEFA held a videoconference on 17 March 2020 with representatives of its 55 member associations, along with a FIFPro representative and the boards of the European Club Association and European Leagues, to discuss the response to the outbreak for domestic and European competitions, including Euro 2020.[32] At the meeting, UEFA announced that the tournament would be postponed to the following year, proposing that it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021.[33] The postponement allowed for pressure to be reduced on the public services in affected countries, while also providing space in the calendar for domestic European leagues that had been suspended to complete their seasons.[34] On the following day, the Bureau of the FIFA Council approved the date change in the FIFA International Match Calendar. As a result, the expanded FIFA Club World Cup, due to take place in June and July 2021, was postponed.[35] On 23 April 2020, UEFA confirmed that the tournament would still be known as UEFA Euro 2020.[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Spectator plans and venue changes[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Čeferin stated that in principle the tournament would take place in the twelve selected host cities. However, he did not rule out the possibility of reducing the number of cities, as three hosts were unsure if matches could be held under the new schedule.[38] The tournament venues and match schedule was reviewed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting on 17 June 2020.[39] At the meeting, UEFA confirmed that all twelve original host venues would remain as hosts for the tournament in 2021, and approved the revised match schedule.[40][41] However, Čeferin stated in October 2020 that it was still possible that the tournament could be played in fewer than the planned twelve host countries.[42] The following month, UEFA stated that it \"intends to hold Euro 2020 in the format and the venues confirmed earlier this year and we are working closely with all host cities on preparations\".[43] It was also announced that each host was discussing with UEFA and local health authorities on whether the venue could host matches at full capacity, between 100% and 50% capacity, at 33% capacity or behind closed doors. Each host city was asked to draw up two or three plans from the four options. The restrictions could also involve only local spectators to be permitted at matches. A final decision on which scenario would be applied individually at each venue was originally to be made on 5 March 2021.[44][45] In October 2020, it was announced that UEFA matches would be suspended from taking place in Armenia and Azerbaijan until further notice due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war.[46] However, this did not affect the planning of Euro 2020 matches to be held in Baku.[47] This restriction was lifted in December 2020 following a ceasefire agreement between the countries.[48]\n\n\nIn a New Year's interview, Čeferin said, \"Vaccination has started and I think we will be able to have full stands in the summer. For now, the plan is to play in all twelve countries. Of course, there are backup options in case a country has a problem. We are ready to organise competitions in eleven, ten or nine cities... and even only in one country, if necessary. However, I am 99.9 percent sure that we will have the European Championship in all twelve cities, as planned.\"[49][50] On 27 January 2021, UEFA met with the host associations to discuss operational matters, and reaffirmed the tournament would be held across twelve cities.[51] The deadline for hosts to submit their venue capacity plans was moved to 7 April 2021,[52] with a final decision on host cities and spectators to originally be made by the UEFA Executive Committee on 19 April 2021.[53] UEFA announced on the following day that Daniel Koch, the former head of communicable diseases at Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health, would serve as the tournament's medical advisor on matters related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[54] In February 2021, the Israel Football Association offered to stage some tournament matches in the country, which had a high rate of vaccination. However, this was turned down by UEFA, who reiterated their commitment to the twelve host cities.[55] In a March 2021 interview, Čeferin said, \"We have several scenarios, but the one guarantee we can make is that the option of playing any Euro 2020 match in an empty stadium is off the table. Every host must guarantee there will be fans at their games.\" UEFA subsequently stated that no host city would be automatically dropped should they decide to play matches behind closed doors. However, UEFA would need to consider whether it would make sense to play matches without spectators, or if these matches should be reallocated to other venues.[56] That same month, British prime minister Boris Johnson offered UEFA to host additional tournament matches in England should any venues need to be reassigned.[57]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2021, UEFA announced that eight of the original twelve tournament hosts confirmed their spectator plans, with stadium capacities ranging from 25% to 100%. Only Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome had yet to submit their plans, with each host originally given an extension until 19 April 2021 to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had guaranteed spectators for the tournament, and was therefore confirmed as a venue.[59] On 19 April, it was announced that another extension was given to the three remaining hosts until 23 April, when UEFA would make its final decision.[60] Due to the need to finalise ticketing details, host cities would have until 28 April to decide on whether to leave their spectator limits unchanged, or to upscale their allowed capacities.[61]\n\n\nOn 23 April, UEFA announced that Seville would replace Bilbao as tournament host, while the matches of Dublin would be reallocated to Saint Petersburg for the group stage and London for the round of 16.[10] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland, the Football Association of Ireland was unable to receive assurances from the Government of Ireland and the Dublin City Council to allow spectators into the stadium.[62][63][64] Meanwhile, the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said the sanitary conditions imposed by the Basque Government to host matches in Bilbao were \"impossible to comply with\", and thus would not allow for spectators to be present.[65] After being removed as hosts, the Bilbao City Council stated they held UEFA and RFEF \"directly responsible for us not staging this sporting event and the unilateral cancellation of our contractual relationships\", and threatened legal action for financial compensation.[66]\n\n\nAlso on 23 April, UEFA announced that local authorities had guaranteed \"a minimum of 14,500 spectators\" for the matches scheduled in Munich, which was therefore confirmed as host of four games.[10] However, both the regional government of Bavaria and the German interior ministry subsequently reiterated their position that there was no such guarantee, and admittance of spectators would depend on the actual pandemic situation at the time of the tournament.[67] A few days later, UEFA president Čeferin backtracked in an interview with a German newspaper, denying that UEFA had demanded guarantees for games with spectators, and conceding that \"the local authorities will decide before the games whether spectators will be admitted or not.\"[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Semi-final and final venue[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Italian President Sergio Mattarella speaks with the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson before the final\nWembley Stadium's hosting of both the semi-finals and the final was threatened over quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom that fans and 2,500 VIPs would be subject to. The Puskás Aréna in Budapest was considered as an alternative venue, as Hungary would have no entry restrictions for travel within the Schengen Area and could host the matches at full capacity.[70] A spokesman for the Hungarian Football Federation said the organisation was \"ready to host any high-level football event\".[71] However, UEFA remained confident that Wembley could host the final, as the organisation and the UK government discussed quarantine exemptions,[72] but did not rule out a change in venue.[73] Minister Kit Malthouse said the government was doing \"as much as we possibly can\" to host the final,[74] while prime minister Boris Johnson stated they would try to make \"sensible accommodations\" for UEFA while still prioritising public health.[75] Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said the final should be held in Rome due to rising COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom.[76] The following week, it was reported that officials and executives travelling for the matches would not need to self-isolate, though they would be subject to restrictions and required to remain in \"football bubbles\".[77][78]\n\n\n\n### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nOn 31 March 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of a maximum of five substitutions in matches at the tournament (with a sixth allowed in extra time).[7] However, each team are only given three opportunities to make substitutions, with a fourth opportunity allowed in extra time, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time.[79] The use of five substitutes has been permitted by IFAB during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the resulting fixture congestion, which has created a greater burden on players.[80]\n\n\nAt the start of April 2021, UEFA also said they were considering allowing tournament squads to be expanded from the usual 23 players, following calls from national team managers in case of a possible COVID outbreak in a team, as well as to reduce player fatigue caused by the fixture congestion of the prior season.[81] On 27 April, it was reported that the UEFA National Team Competitions Committee had approved the expansion of squads to 26 players, subject to confirmation by the UEFA Executive Committee.[82] On 4 May 2021, the executive committee confirmed the use of 26-player squads. However, teams still may only name a maximum of 23 players on the match sheet for each tournament fixture (of which 12 are substitutes), in line with the Laws of the Game. These 23 must include three goalkeepers. It was also announced that after each team's first match, goalkeepers may still be replaced due to physical incapacity, even if the other goalkeepers from the squad are still available.[83]\n\n\nWater breaks were permitted so that players could drink from their own personal bottles.[84] Cooling breaks, first seen at the 2014 FIFA World Cup were also permitted for games played in higher temperatures.[85]\n\n\n\n### Special rules due to COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 May 2021, the UEFA Executive Committee approved special rules for the final tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe:[83][86]\n\n\n\n* If a group of players of a team were placed into mandatory quarantine or self-isolation following a decision from national or local health officials due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match will go ahead as scheduled as long as the team had at least 13 players available (including at least one goalkeeper). If fewer than 13 players were available (including at least one goalkeeper), additional players could have been called up to meet the minimum of 13 players required. In such a case, an equivalent number of quarantined players must have been definitively withdrawn from the 26-player list.\n* If a team cannot field the minimum required number of players due to positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, the match may be rescheduled within the next 48 hours of the original date of the match by the UEFA administration, subject to viable rescheduling options being available. Additionally, UEFA may reassign the rescheduled match to an alternative venue if deemed appropriate.\n* If the match cannot be rescheduled, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will decide on the matter. The team responsible for the match not taking place are considered to have forfeited the match and lost 3–0.\n* If any member of the appointed referee team has to be replaced due to positive SARS-CoV-2 test, UEFA can exceptionally appoint a match official of the same nationality as one of the teams or not on the FIFA list.\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying\n\n![](image)Team qualified for UEFA Euro 2020\n Team failed to qualify\n\nThere was no automatic qualifying berth, and all 55 UEFA national teams, including the twelve national teams whose countries were selected to stage matches, had to compete in the qualifiers for the 24 places at the finals tournament.[87][88] As the host cities were appointed by UEFA in September 2014, before the qualifiers, it was possible for the national teams from the host cities to fail to qualify for the finals tournament. The qualifying draw was held on 2 December 2018 at the Convention Centre Dublin in Dublin, Ireland.[89]\n\n\nThe main qualifying process started in March 2019, instead of immediately in September 2018 following the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and ended in November 2019. The format remained largely the same, although only 20 of the 24 spots for the finals tournament were decided from the main qualifying process, leaving four spots still to be decided. Following the admission of Kosovo to UEFA in May 2016, it was announced that the 55 members at the time would be drawn into ten groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams, with the four participants of the UEFA Nations League Finals guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The qualifiers were played on double matchdays in March, June, September, October and November 2019.[90]\n\n\nWith the creation of the UEFA Nations League starting in 2018,[91][90][92][93] the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League was linked with Euro qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for the tournament. Four teams from each division that had not already qualified for the European Championship competed in the play-offs for each division. The winners of the play-offs for each division, which were decided by two one-off semi-finals (the best-ranked team vs. the lowest-ranked team, and the second-best-ranked team vs. the third-best-ranked team, played at home of higher-ranked teams) and a one-off final (with the venue drawn in advance between the two semi-finals winners), joined the 20 teams that had already qualified for the tournament.[93]\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nOf the 24 teams that qualified for the tournament, 19 were returning from the 2016 edition. Among them were Belgium and Italy, who both had recorded flawless qualifying campaigns (ten wins in ten matches),[94][95] defending European champions Portugal and world champions France, with Germany also qualifying for a record 13th straight European Championship.[96] Finland and North Macedonia made their European Championship debuts, having never previously qualified for a major tournament.[97][98] Scotland, a co-host of the tournament, qualified for their first major international tournament since the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and their first European Championship since 1996.[99] The Netherlands and Denmark returned after missing out in 2016, with the Dutch featuring in a major tournament for the first time since the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[100][101] For the first time, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia and Wales reached successive European Championship tournaments.[102][103] Greece, winners in 2004, were the only former champions that failed to qualify, missing their second straight European Championship and third consecutive major tournament.[104] Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Romania failed to qualify after appearing in the 2016 finals.[105]\n\n\nNine out of eleven host countries managed to qualify for the final tournament. Denmark, England, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia and Spain all qualified directly, while Hungary and Scotland qualified only after winning their respective play-off path. Azerbaijan and Romania failed to qualify, with Azerbaijan failing to qualify from the group stage[106] and Romania losing in the play-off.[107]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team[A] | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[B] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group I winner | 10 October 2019 | 5 (*1972*, 1980, 1984, *2000*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Italy* | Group J winner | 12 October 2019 | 9 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Russia*[C] | Group I runner-up | 13 October 2019 | 11 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Group G winner | 13 October 2019 | 3 (2008, *2012*, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Group B winner | 14 October 2019 | 2 (*2012*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Spain* | Group F winner | 15 October 2019 | 10 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, **2008**, **2012**, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group H winner | 14 November 2019 | 9 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004, 2008, 2012, *2016*)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Group H runner-up | 14 November 2019 | 4 (1996, 2000, 2008, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) England* | Group A winner | 14 November 2019 | 9 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000, 2004, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[D] | Group A runner-up | 14 November 2019 | 9 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Finland | Group J runner-up | 15 November 2019 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group F runner-up | 15 November 2019 | 6 (*1992*, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group E winner | 16 November 2019 | 5 (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | Group G runner-up | 16 November 2019 | 2 (*2008*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Netherlands* | Group C runner-up | 16 November 2019 | 9 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| *![](image) Germany*[E] | Group C winner | 16 November 2019 | 12 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group B runner-up | 17 November 2019 | 7 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*, 2008, 2012, **2016**)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group D winner | 18 November 2019 | 4 (1996, 2004, *2008*, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Denmark* | Group D runner-up | 18 November 2019 | 8 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | Group E runner-up | 19 November 2019 | 1 (2016)\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia | Play-off Path D winner | 12 November 2020 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| *![](image) Hungary* | Play-off Path A winner | 12 November 2020 | 3 (1964, 1972, 2016)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia[D] | Play-off Path B winner | 12 November 2020 | 4 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 2016)\n |\n| *![](image) Scotland* | Play-off Path C winner | 12 November 2020 | 2 (1992, 1996)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** *Italic* indicates team from one of the eleven host associations.\n2. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n3. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** From 1960 to 1980, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia competed as Czechoslovakia.[108][109][110]\n5. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nThe 13 original venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[111] However, the UEFA Executive Committee removed Brussels as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of Eurostadium. The four matches (three group stage, one round of 16) initially scheduled to be held in Brussels were reallocated to Wembley Stadium in London.[9] On 23 April 2021, UEFA announced that due to a lack of guarantees regarding spectators caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Aviva Stadium in Dublin was removed as a tournament host. Their four matches were reallocated to Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg for the three group stage matches, and Wembley Stadium in London for the round of 16 fixture. Similarly, UEFA reassigned the four matches in Spain elsewhere in the country, with La Cartuja in Seville replacing San Mamés in Bilbao.[10]\n\n\nOn 7 December 2017, it was also announced that the opening match would take place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, chosen ahead of Amsterdam, Glasgow and Saint Petersburg. UEFA decided that the opening match would feature Italy if they qualified.[9][112]\n\n\nOf the eleven selected cities and countries, seven cities and six countries had never hosted a European Championship finals match before. Seville was not a venue when Spain hosted the 1964 European Nations' Cup, and none of Azerbaijan, Denmark, Hungary, Romania, Russia or Scotland had hosted the tournament previously. Of the eleven selected stadiums, only two had hosted a European Championship match before: the Stadio Olimpico (1968 and 1980) and the Johan Cruyff Arena (2000). The original Wembley stadium hosted games and the final in UEFA Euro 1996, but although it stood on the same site, this was classified as a different stadium to the current Wembley Stadium.\n\n\n\n| ![England](image) London | ![Italy](image) Rome | ![UEFA Euro 2020 is located in Europe](image)![London](image)\nLondon\n![Rome](image)\nRome\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Baku](image)\nBaku\n![Saint Petersburg](image)\nSaint Petersburg\n![Budapest](image)\nBudapest\n![Seville](image)\nSeville\n![Bucharest](image)\nBucharest\n![Amsterdam](image)\nAmsterdam\n![Glasgow](image)\nGlasgow\n![Copenhagen](image)\nCopenhagen\n | ![Germany](image) Munich |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wembley Stadium | Stadio Olimpico | Allianz Arena |\n| Capacity: **90,000** | Capacity: **70,634** | Capacity: **70,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![Azerbaijan](image) Baku | ![Russia](image) Saint Petersburg | ![Hungary](image) Budapest |\n| Olympic Stadium | Krestovsky Stadium | Puskás Aréna |\n| Capacity: **68,000** | Capacity: **68,134** | Capacity: **67,215** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![Spain](image) Seville | ![Romania](image) Bucharest | ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam | ![Scotland](image) Glasgow | ![Denmark](image) Copenhagen |\n| La Cartuja | Arena Națională | Johan Cruyff Arena | Hampden Park | Parken Stadium |\n| Capacity: **57,600** | Capacity: **55,600** | Capacity: **54,990** | Capacity: **51,866** | Capacity: **38,065** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\nEach city hosted three group stage matches and one match in the round of 16 or quarter-finals, with the exception of Saint Petersburg, which hosted six group stage matches, and London, which hosted host two matches in the round of 16. The match allocation for the eleven stadiums is as follows:\n\n\n\n* **Group stage, round of 16, semi-finals and final:** London (England)\n* **Group stage and quarter-finals:** Baku (Azerbaijan), Munich (Germany), Rome (Italy), Saint Petersburg (Russia)\n* **Group stage and round of 16:** Amsterdam (Netherlands), Bucharest (Romania), Budapest (Hungary), Copenhagen (Denmark), Glasgow (Scotland), Seville (Spain)\n\n\n### Group stage hosts[edit]\n\n\nThe host cities were divided into six pairings, established on the basis of sporting strength (assuming all host teams qualify), geographical considerations and security/political constraints. The pairings were allocated to groups by means of a random draw on 7 December 2017. Each qualified host country played a minimum of two matches at home. The following group venue pairings were announced:[9]\n\n\n\n* **Group A:** Rome (Italy) and Baku (Azerbaijan)\n* **Group B:** Saint Petersburg (Russia) and Copenhagen (Denmark)\n* **Group C:** Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Bucharest (Romania)\n* **Group D:** London (England) and Glasgow (Scotland)\n* **Group E:** Originally Bilbao (Spain) and Dublin (Republic of Ireland)\n\t+ Later changed to Seville (Spain) and Saint Petersburg (Russia)[a]\n* **Group F:** Munich (Germany) and Budapest (Hungary)\n\n\nThe following criteria applied to define the home matches of host teams within the same group:[113]\n\n\n\n* If both host teams qualified directly or both advanced to the play-offs, a draw determined which team would play all three group stage matches at home (including the head-to-head match), and which one played only two matches at home.\n* If one host team qualified directly, and the other failed to also directly qualify, the directly qualified host team played all three group stage matches at home, and the other host, if qualified, would play only two.\n* If one host team advanced to the play-offs, and the other was eliminated entirely, the host team in the play-offs, if qualified, had played all three group stage matches at home.\n* No action was necessary should both host teams failed to have qualified.\n\n\nIf a host team in the play-offs failed to qualify, the path winner would take the spot of the host in the match schedule and therefore would play the two or three matches based on the above criteria in the host city of the respective host that failed to qualify. The draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the draw for the play-offs).[114] In the draw, which was only necessary for Group B (Denmark and Russia), two balls were prepared, with the first drawn hosting the three matches.[115]\n\n\n\n\n\nAllocation of group stage home matches to host countries\n| Group\n | Host\n | Status of host\n | Draw\n | Number of home matches\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Three\n | Two\n |\n| A | ![](image) Azerbaijan | Eliminated in qualifying group stage\n | No\n | ![](image) Italy | None\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Qualified directly to finals\n |\n| B | ![](image) Denmark | Qualified directly to finals\n | Yes\n | ![](image) Denmark | ![](image) Russia |\n| ![](image) Russia | Qualified directly to finals\n |\n| C | ![](image) Netherlands | Qualified directly to finals\n | No\n | ![](image) Netherlands | None\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Eliminated via play-offs\n |\n| D | ![](image) England | Qualified directly to finals\n | No\n | ![](image) England | ![](image) Scotland |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Qualified via play-offs\n |\n| E | ~~![](image) Republic of Ireland~~[a] | Eliminated via play-offs\n | No\n | ![](image) Spain | None\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Qualified directly to finals\n |\n| F | ![](image) Germany | Qualified directly to finals\n | No\n | ![](image) Germany | ![](image) Hungary |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Qualified via play-offs\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In April 2021, Dublin was removed as a tournament host, with their group stage matches reallocated to Saint Petersburg, who were already hosts of Group B.\n\n### Spectator limits[edit]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on public gatherings, many of the venues at the tournament were unable to operate at full capacity. UEFA asked each host to devise a spectator plan in conjunction with their local/national government and health authorities. The hosts were given a deadline of 7 April 2021 to communicate their plans with UEFA. On 9 April, UEFA announced that eight of the tournament hosts had confirmed their stadium capacities, ranging from 25% to 100%. The remaining four hosts (Bilbao, Dublin, Munich and Rome) were given an extension until 23 April to submit their venue capacities.[58] On 14 April, UEFA announced that Rome had also confirmed its venue capacity.[59] On 23 April, the venue capacity for Munich was also confirmed, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville, which could guarantee spectators. In addition, Dublin was removed as a host, as it was unable to ensure spectators could attend.[10]\n\n\nMany of the matches did not see stadiums filled to their allowed capacity, with only Netherlands group stage matches that were played at the Johan Cruyff Arena seeing the stadium come within less than a thousand seats of being full. The match between England and Croatia saw an attendance of 18,497, compared to the allowed capacity of 22,500, with UEFA suggesting quarantine restrictions as the cause for the smaller attendance.[116]\n\n\n\n\n\nAllowed capacities of UEFA Euro 2020 venues\n| City\n | Venue\n | Standard capacity\n | Allowed capacity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amsterdam | Johan Cruyff Arena | 54,990\n | At least 33% (approximately 16,000), subject to possible increase[117] |\n| Baku | Olympic Stadium | 68,700\n | 50% (approximately 34,350), with no foreign spectators permitted other than citizens of participating teams[118] |\n| Bucharest | Arena Națională | 55,600\n | At least 25% (approximately 13,000) for the group stage and 50% (approximately 25,000) for the round of 16 match[119][120] |\n| Budapest | Puskás Aréna | 67,215\n | Full capacity, subject to spectators fulfilling strict stadium entry requirements\n |\n| Copenhagen | Parken Stadium | 38,065\n | 40% (approximately 15,900) for the first match against Finland and 67% (approximately 25,000) for the remaining two group stage matches and the round of 16 match.[121] |\n| Glasgow | Hampden Park | 51,866\n | 25% (approximately 12,000)[122] |\n| London | Wembley Stadium | 90,000\n | 25% (approximately 22,500) for the group stage and the first match in the round of 16, 50% (approximately 45,000) for the second match in the round of 16 and 67% (approximately 60,000) for the semi-finals and final[123] |\n| Munich | Allianz Arena | 70,000\n | 20% (14,000)[124] |\n| Rome | Stadio Olimpico | 70,634\n | At least 25% (approximately 17,659), subject to possible increase[125] |\n| Saint Petersburg | Krestovsky Stadium | 68,134\n | At least 50% (approximately 34,067), subject to possible increase\n |\n| Seville | Estadio de La Cartuja | 60,000\n | 30% (approximately 18,000)\n |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team chose a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. Unlike previous tournaments, each team could set up their base camp anywhere due to the pan-European format, without any obligation of staying in any of the host countries.[126]\n\n\nThe base camps selected by the 20 directly qualified teams were announced by UEFA on 27 January 2020.[127] The base camps of the remaining teams qualified via the play-offs were announced in 2021.[128]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Seefeld in Tirol, Austria\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Tubize, Belgium\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Rovinj, Croatia[a] |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Prague, Czech Republic[b] |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Helsingør, Denmark\n |\n| ![](image) England | Burton upon Trent, England\n |\n| ![](image) Finland | Repino, Saint Petersburg, Russia\n |\n| ![](image) France | Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines, France\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | Herzogenaurach, Germany\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Telki, Hungary\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Coverciano, Florence, Italy\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Zeist, Netherlands\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia | Bucharest, Romania\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Sopot, Poland[c] |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Budapest, Hungary\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | Novogorsk, Khimki, Russia\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Hurworth-on-Tees, England[131] |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Saint Petersburg, Russia[d] |\n| ![](image) Spain | Las Rozas de Madrid, Spain\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Gothenburg, Sweden[e] |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Rome, Italy\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Baku, Azerbaijan\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Bucharest, Romania\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | Baku, Azerbaijan\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Originally St Andrews, Scotland,[127] but moved due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Scotland.[129]\n2. **^** Originally Currie, Edinburgh, Scotland,[127] but moved due to COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Scotland[130]\n3. **^** Originally Portmarnock, Republic of Ireland[127]\n4. **^** Originally Castleknock, Republic of Ireland,[132][133]\n5. **^** Originally Maynooth, Republic of Ireland.[127]\n\n## Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament was held on 30 November 2019, 18:00 CET (19:00 local time, EET) at Romexpo in Bucharest, Romania.[134][135][136][106] The 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four. The identity of the four play-off teams were not known at the time of the draw and were identified as play-off winners A to D.[137] Should there have been groups that could not be finalised at the time of the final tournament draw, another draw would have been held after the play-offs on 1 April 2020,[1] but UEFA confirmed the additional draw was not necessary after the identity of the 20 directly qualified teams and the 16 play-offs teams was known.[115]\n\n\nThe teams were seeded in accordance with the European Qualifiers overall ranking based on their results in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. The following was the standard composition of the draw pots:[138]\n\n\n\n* Pot 1: Group winners ranked 1–6\n* Pot 2: Group winners ranked 7–10, group runners-up ranked 1–2 (11–12 overall)\n* Pot 3: Group runners-up ranked 3–8 (13–18 overall)\n* Pot 4: Group runners-up ranked 9–10 (19–20 overall), play-off winners A–D (identity unknown at the time of the draw)\n\n\nAs two host teams from the same group could not be in the same seeding pot, the UEFA Emergency Panel would have either switched one host team with the lowest-ranked team of the higher pot, or switched one host team with the highest-ranked team of the lower pot (based on the principle that the move would have minimal impact on the original seeding). However, no seeding adjustments were necessary.\n\n\nThe draw started with Pot 1 and completed with Pot 4, from where a team was drawn and assigned to the first available group. The position in the group (for the determination of the match schedule) was then drawn. In the draw, the following conditions applied (including for teams that could still qualify via the play-offs):[139]\n\n\n\n* **Automatic group assignments**: Host teams were automatically assigned to their group based on the host city pairings.\n* **Prohibited clashes**: For political reasons, UEFA set pairs of teams that were considered prohibited clashes. In addition to being unable to be drawn into the same group, non-host teams were prevented from being drawn into a group hosted by a country they clash with, even should the host not qualify. Only one prohibited clash, Russia / Ukraine, applied during the group stage draw. Other prohibited clashes among qualified and play-off teams were Kosovo / Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo / Serbia, but the teams in these pairs were all in the play-offs and in Pot 4 for the draw, and would not be in the same group; Kosovo / Russia was also prohibited,[140] but they also would not be in the same group due to play-off path pairings necessary for host allocation. However, these prohibited clashes are not excluded for the knockout phase.\n\n\n### Play-off path group allocation[edit]\n\n\nDue to the format of the play-offs, which made anticipating all possible scenarios impossible, the UEFA administration had to wait to solve issues relating to the final tournament draw until the completion of the qualifying group stage.[113] It was not possible for UEFA to prevent one of the play-off paths from containing two host teams, resulting in Romania (Group C hosts) and Hungary (Group F hosts) being drawn together in Path A. Therefore, the winner of this play-off path needed to be assigned two groups in the final tournament draw. To allow for this, Path A was paired with Path D (which does not contain a host), therefore providing a clear scenario for each possible qualified team. A draw took place on 22 November 2019, 12:00 CET, at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland (along with the play-offs draw), which decided on the order of priority for the allocation of Path A to the final tournament groups.[115]\n\n\nTwo balls were prepared containing the names of the two groups hosted by the teams in question (Group C and Group F for Romania and Hungary, respectively). The first ball drawn determined the group (\"priority group\") that was allocated to Path A, with the exception of the host team of the second ball drawn (\"non-priority group\") winning Path A. In the draw, Group F was selected as the priority group, resulting in the following possible outcomes:\n\n\n\n* **Path A is won by Bulgaria, Hungary or Iceland**: The winner of Path A will enter Group F, and the winner of Path D will enter Group C.

However, the maximum number of players permitted on the match sheet for each tournament fixture remained 23.[83] Each nation's squad, which had to include three goalkeepers, was submitted at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament (by 1 June 2021). If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player;[1] however, goalkeepers could still be replaced after their team's first match due to physical incapacity.[83]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 September 2018, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) system for the first time at the UEFA European Championship.[8] On 12 February 2020, UEFA and CONMEBOL signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance collaboration, including the possibility of a team of South American match officials appointed for the group stage of the tournament.[142]\n\n\nOn 21 April 2021, UEFA announced the 19 refereeing teams for the tournament.[143] This included Argentine referee Fernando Rapallini and his assistants, who were the first South American officials to be selected for the European Championship as part of UEFA's referee exchange programme with CONMEBOL. A group of Spanish officials were similarly selected for the 2021 Copa América.[144]\n\n\nA refereeing team of nine officials was appointed for each match. The team of five at the stadium consisted of a referee, two assistant referees, a fourth official and a reserve assistant referee.[144] In addition, four video match officials were located at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. This team consisted of a video assistant referee (the lead video official who was the main point of contact with the referee), an assistant video assistant referee (AVAR 1, who concentrated on following the match), an offside VAR (AVAR 2, who reviewed all potential offside situations) and a support VAR (AVAR 3, who acted in a coordination capacity).[145] The tournament used the 2021 Laws of the Game, which came into force on 1 July but could be introduced in competitions that began immediately beforehand.[146]\n\n\n\n\n\nRefereeing teams\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistant referees\n |

Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony took place at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Italy, on 11 June 2021 at 20:35 (CEST) prior to the first match of the tournament. Italian opera tenor Andrea Bocelli performed the song \"Nessun dorma\".[148] Martin Garrix, Bono and the Edge also featured, performing the tournament's official anthem, \"We Are the People\". The performance was a virtual one amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and was filmed at motion-control studios in London and at the Stadio Olimpico to recreate the stadium environment in 3D.[149]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Result of teams participating in UEFA Euro 2020 |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winner\n Runner-up\n | Semi-finals\n Quarter-finals\n | Round of 16\nGroup stage\n |\n\nUEFA announced the original tournament schedule on 24 May 2018, which only included kick-off times for the opening match and quarter-finals onward.[150][151] The kick-off times of the remaining group stage and round of 16 matches were announced on 30 November 2019 following the final draw.[152] On 17 June 2020, UEFA announced the revised match schedule for the tournament in 2021.[153][154] All match dates, kick-off times and venues remained identical, but shifted one day earlier so matches would remain on the same day of the week (i.e. from 12 to 11 June for the opening match to remain on a Friday). On 23 April 2021, UEFA revised the venue assignments of the match schedule after one stadium was removed from the tournament and another was replaced.[155]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\n\n\n*Times are CEST (UTC+2), as listed by UEFA. If the venue was located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[1]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings.[a] If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 10 applied;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. Higher number of wins in all group matches;[b]\n8. If on the last round of the group stage, two teams were facing each other and each had the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finished level in their match, their ranking was determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion was not used if more than two teams had the same number of points.);\n9. Lower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card);\n10. Higher position in the European Qualifiers overall ranking.\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** If there was a three-way tie on points, the application of the first three criteria could only break the tie for one of the teams, leaving the other two teams still tied. In this case, the tiebreaking procedure was resumed, from the beginning, for the two teams that were still tied.\n2. **^** This criterion could only break a tie if a point deduction were to occur, as multiple teams in the same group could not otherwise be tied on points but have a different number of wins.\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Italy (H) | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 0\n | +7\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Wales | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 2\n | +1\n | 4[a] |\n| 3\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 5\n | −1\n | 4[a] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Turkey | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 1\n | 8\n | −7\n | 0\n |  |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Wales 1–1 Switzerland).

The logo depicted the Henri Delaunay Trophy surrounded by celebrating fans on a bridge, which, according to UEFA, represented how football connects and unifies people.[223][224]\n\n\nEach individual host city also had their own unique logo. The rectangular logos featured the text *UEFA EURO 2020* on the top, the city name above the text *host city* on the bottom (all in uppercase), the main tournament logo on the left and a local bridge on the right. Each logo existed in English, along with variations in the local language when applicable. The logos were unveiled from September 2016 to January 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nLogos of host cities\n| Host city\n | Date announced\n | Bridge\n | Other language\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| London | 21 September 2016[a] | Tower Bridge | —\n | [224] |\n| Rome | 22 September 2016\n | Ponte Sant'Angelo | Italian\n | [225] |\n| Baku | 30 September 2016\n | Baku cable-stayed bridge | Azerbaijani\n | [226] |\n| Bucharest | 15 October 2016\n | Basarab Overpass | Romanian\n | [227] |\n| Glasgow | 25 October 2016\n | Clyde Arc | —\n | [228] |\n| Munich | 27 October 2016\n | Wittelsbacherbrücke | German\n | [229] |\n| Copenhagen | 1 November 2016\n | Circle Bridge | Danish\n | [230] |\n| Budapest | 16 November 2016\n | Széchenyi Chain Bridge | Hungarian\n | [231] |\n| Amsterdam | 16 December 2016\n | Magere Brug | Dutch\n | [232] |\n| Saint Petersburg | 19 January 2017\n | Palace Bridge | Russian\n | [233] |\n| Seville | —\n | Alamillo Bridge | Spanish\n | [234] |\n\n\n1. **^** As part of the main logo launch event.\n\n\n\nLogos of removed host cities\n| Host city\n | Date announced\n | Bridge\n | Other language(s)\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dublin | 24 November 2016\n | Samuel Beckett Bridge | Irish\n | [235] |\n| Brussels | 14 December 2016\n | Pont Sobieski [fr] | Dutch, French\n | [236] |\n| Bilbao | 15 December 2016\n | San Antón Bridge | Spanish\n | [237] |\n\n\nThe official slogan of the tournament was \"Live It. For Real.\" The slogan was meant to encourage fans to see the matches live in the stadiums across Europe.[238]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official match ball \"Uniforia\"\nOn 6 November 2019, UEFA announced that the \"Uniforia\" by Adidas would be the tournament's official match ball. Predominantly white, the ball featured black strokes with blue, neon and pink stripes with panels designed to resemble a hashtag, and had the coordinates of twelve cities which hosted the finals (including Dublin and Bilbao, which were later removed as the host cities). The name was derived from a portmanteau of \"unity\" and \"euphoria\".[239]\n\n\nA special variation named \"Uniforia Finale\" was launched on 5 July 2021, to be used in both semi-finals and the final match. The ball had a silver base, a different colour arrangement, and Wembley Stadium's coordinates (51° 33' 21,5\" N, 0° 16' 46,4\" W) written on the ball.\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adidas Uniforia Finale, which was used in the semifinals and final match\nThe official mascot of the tournament, *Skillzy*, was unveiled on 24 March 2019. The character was inspired by freestyle football, street football, and panna culture.[240]\n\n\n\n### Official song[edit]\n\n\nMain article: We Are the People (Martin Garrix song)\n\nOn 19 October 2019, Dutch DJ and music producer Martin Garrix was announced as the official music artist of the tournament.[241] He produced the official song of the tournament, as well as the walkout music preceding matches and the television broadcast music.[242] The official song, \"We Are the People\", featured Bono and the Edge from Irish rock band U2 and was released on 14 May 2021.[243][244] It was first performed in full at a virtual opening ceremony at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship video games\n\nThe game was released by Konami as a free DLC on *eFootball PES 2020* in June 2020, and on the *eFootball PES 2021 Season Update* on launch day. It included the official kits and player likenesses for all 55 officially licensed UEFA teams. The update also included five out of eleven venues of the tournament, as well as the official match ball.[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA had the following sponsorship partners:[247]\n\n\n\n* \"National Team Football Official Sponsors\": Alibaba Group (Alipay brand),[248] Booking Holdings,[249] FedEx,[250] Gazprom,[251] Hisense,[252] and Volkswagen.[253]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Sponsors\": Coca-Cola,[254] Heineken,[255] Qatar Airways,[256] Takeaway.com,[257] TikTok,[258] and Vivo Mobile.[259]\n* \"Euro 2020 Official Licensees\": Adidas, Hublot, IMG, Konami, and Panini.\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2020 broadcasting rights\n\nThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the Expo Haarlemmermeer in Vijfhuizen, Netherlands.[260]\n\n\n\n## Incidents and controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Ukraine kit[edit]\n\n\nThe team of Ukraine presented its shirt for the championship, decorated with a map of national borders, including Crimea. The peninsula was annexed by the Russian Federation in 2014 but is still considered part of its territory by Ukraine and the United Nations. The shirt carried the slogan \"Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that it was a Ukrainian nationalist slogan that imitated a Nazi one. Russian Deputy Dmitry Svishchev called UEFA to intervene because the shirt was \"totally inappropriate\".[261] UEFA said there was no dispute for the map of Ukraine, as it reflected the borders recognized by the United Nations, while it ordered the removal of the phrase, as \"specific combination of the two slogans is deemed to be clearly political in nature, having historic and militaristic significance.\"[262]\n\n\n\n### Collapse of Christian Eriksen[edit]\n\n\nThe Denmark vs Finland match in Group B was suspended minutes prior to half-time after Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen collapsed on the pitch after suffering a sudden cardiac arrest. He was given immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, then transferred to Rigshospitalet and stabilised, with the match resuming by the decision of the Danish team later that evening.[263][264][265]\n\n\nFollowing the match, the Danish team stated that it was unfair they had to decide to continue playing the match.[266] Former Danish international Peter Schmeichel said that the Danish team had been given the options to finish the game that same day, finish the game the next day at 12 pm, or forfeit the game and lose 3–0. UEFA denied that either team had been threatened with a forfeit.[267]\n\n\nBritish broadcaster BBC received over 6,000 complaints over the UEFA video-feed broadcasting live images of Eriksen receiving CPR on the pitch.[268][269] Eriksen was later fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and returned to playing with Brentford eight months later.[270]\n\n\n\n### Marko Arnautović insult[edit]\n\n\nIn the Austria vs North Macedonia match on 13 June 2021, Austrian player Marko Arnautović insulted Macedonian player Ezgjan Alioski and his family after his goal to make it 3–1. Arnautović is of Serbian descent, and Alioski is of Albanian descent; both countries have been in conflict over Kosovo for decades. The Football Federation of North Macedonia lodged a complaint with UEFA after the game, demanding a clear penalty. The UEFA Control Committee then opened an investigation, Arnautović was banned from the next game by UEFA for \"insulting another player\", and was unable to play in Netherlands vs Austria, the group's second game.[271]\n\n\n\n### Removing marketing drink bottles[edit]\n\n\nAt a press conference before Hungary vs Portugal on 14 June 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo removed Coca-Cola bottles from the table and then held a water bottle in front of the camera to highlight that water, healthier than Coca-Cola, is his ideal drink;[272][273] it was thought that Ronaldo's actions were behind the collapse of Coca-Cola market value, but it was later found it had nothing to do with it.[274][275] After France vs Germany, France's Paul Pogba, a practising Muslim,[276] moved bottles of non-alcoholic Heineken beer from the table at a press conference.[277] After these two actions, UEFA spoke with each team participating in the European Championship, in which it pointed out the importance of sponsors. UEFA also said that if it happened again, then punishments would be given out to those players.[278]\n\n\n\n### Greenpeace protest[edit]\n\n\nIn the run-up to the France vs Germany on 15 June 2021 in Munich, a man with a paramotor got stuck on a fixed rope during a flight over the stadium, fell into a descent, grazed the spectator stands, and landed on the pitch. In the action planned as a protest by Greenpeace against car manufacturer Volkswagen, in which only a large ball with a label was supposed to be thrown onto the field, two people in the stands suffered head injuries and had to receive medical care.[279] The campaign provoked strong criticism due to the endangerment of viewers; UEFA criticised it as a \"reckless and dangerous action\" that could have had serious consequences for many people.[280] The German Football Association (DFB), the Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder, and other politicians made similar statements, and Greenpeace apologised. A total flight ban was issued over the stadium for the duration of the European Championship. The Munich police are investigating the paramotor pilot for dangerous bodily harm, trespassing, and violation of the Aviation Act.[281][282]\n\n\n\n### Captain's rainbow armband[edit]\n\n\nIn connection with Pride Month, the German team used related symbolism. Team captain Manuel Neuer wore a captain's armband in rainbow colours in a friendly against Latvia on 7 June and continued to wear the armband in Germany's subsequent games. An investigation by UEFA followed during the group stage of the tournament. They assessed the armband as a \"team symbol for diversity\" and \"a good cause.\" UEFA decided not to impose a penalty because of the rule broken by Neuer, which obliges team captains to wear UEFA captains' armbands.[283]\n\n\n\n### Illumination of the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lighting of the Allianz Arena in rainbow colours (2016)\nBefore the Germany vs Hungary group stage match on 23 June 2021, Munich City Council applied to UEFA to have the façade of the stadium illuminated in rainbow colours as a sign of diversity and tolerance. Since the project was understood as a protest against a law passed by the Hungarian Parliament that, according to its critics, restricts the \"information rights\" of young people with regard to homosexuality and gender transitioning,[284] UEFA rejected the application with reference to its status as a politically and religiously neutral organisation.[285] After initially approving the illumination of the stadium in rainbow colours, the German Football Association joined the UEFA position. The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter criticised these decisions and described the illumination not as a political measure but as what he called a sign of humanity and a symbol for the acceptance of equality between people.[286] In contrast, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó welcomed UEFA's decision \"not to be involved in a political provocation against Hungary.\"[287]\n\n\nNumerous reactions from German political parties condemned the ban by UEFA. Nationwide, other football stadiums, such as those in Cologne, Augsburg, Frankfurt, Wolfsburg, Berlin, and Darmstadt, were to be illuminated in the rainbow colours. Munich illuminated the Town Hall, Olympiaturm, and the wind turbine right next to the football arena. In the Netherlands, the Erasmusbrug, Ziggo Dome, tower in Alphen aan den Rijn and several town halls were illuminated.[288][289] In protest against the UEFA ban, several large German corporations also changed their company logos on social media sites to rainbow colours. This included BMW, Volkswagen, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Sparkasse, and HypoVereinsbank.[290] CSD Germany announced that they would be distributing up to 11,000 flags, 5,000 cardboard boxes, and 4,500 stickers with the words \"Don't Kick LGBTIQ Rights\" to fans in front of the stadium. On 23 June, UEFA itself also changed their logo in social media to include a rainbow background, with a statement that \"the rainbow is not a political symbol, but a sign of our firm commitment to a more diverse and inclusive society.\"[291] As a counter-action, Gábor Kubatov, president of the Hungarian club Ferencváros and vice-president of Fidesz, called for stadiums in Hungary to be illuminated in the Hungarian national colours. In addition, Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán cancelled a visit to Munich in protest.[292][293]\n\n\n\n### Confiscation of rainbow flag in Baku[edit]\n\n\nSee also: LGBT rights in Azerbaijan\n\nOn 3 July 2021, UEFA began an investigation after two fans had a rainbow flag confiscated during the quarter-final match between the Czech Republic and Denmark at the Baku Olympic Stadium in Azerbaijan.[294][295] Photos emerged while the match was being played, showing two stewards taking a rainbow flag, waved in support of the LGBTQ+ community, being taken.[296] In a statement, UEFA said: \"UEFA never instructed stewards in Baku – or in any other stadium – to confiscate rainbow flags. We are currently investigating what happened and we will of course contact the UEFA delegate, UEFA security officer and local authorities to clear this up. The rainbow flag is a symbol that embodies UEFA core values, promoting everything that we believe in – a more just and egalitarian society, tolerant of everyone and UEFA has ensured that the flag was returned to the supporter.\"[297]\n\n\n\n### England vs Denmark incidents[edit]\n\n\nIn the 104th minute in the England vs Denmark semi-final match, on-field referee Danny Makkelie awarded a penalty kick to England after adjudging Danish defender Joakim Mæhle to have fouled English player Raheem Sterling in the penalty area. Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel stopped Harry Kane's penalty kick, but Kane was able to score from the rebound. In a press conference shortly after the match, Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand expressed his dissatisfaction with the penalty decision,[298] as well as the fact that there were two balls on the pitch when the foul was given.[299] Non-English commentators such as Arsène Wenger, José Mourinho, and Dietmar Hamann criticised the penalty decision during and after the match, arguing that the penalty should not have been awarded when checked by VAR, while Roy Keane described it as \"very, very soft\".[300][301] Former England forward Alan Shearer also described the penalty decision as \"soft\", and said he would be \"pretty angry if that penalty was given against England\", while former England full-back Gary Neville said: \"If we're being fair, you'd be absolutely devastated if you lost to a penalty like that.\" Match official and current ESPN rules analyst Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the UEFA Euro 2016 Final, said he would not have awarded a penalty kick for a tackle of this sort \"in such a key moment.\"[302][303]\n\n\nThe *Birmingham Mail* claimed Denmark disrupted the English wall during a critical free kick that led to the opening goal of the match, and that Denmark's goal should have been disallowed as a result. According to the FIFA Laws of the Game, during a free kick, attackers must be within one metre from the defending team's wall, a rule that was violated by the Danish players who were accused of blocking goalkeeper Jordan Pickford's vision.[304]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, a day after the match, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the English Football Association over a laser pointed at Danish goalkeeper Schmeichel just before the decisive penalty, booing when the Danish national anthem was played, and use of pyrotechnics.[305][306][307][308] The laser pointer first came to the notice of both the Football Association and UEFA in the first half of extra time but a search for the culprit was unsuccessful.[309] The Football Association were fined £25,630 (€30,000) for the three offences.[310][311][312]\n\n\n\n### Italy vs England incidents[edit]\n\n\n#### Storming of Wembley stadium before final[edit]\n\n\nOn the day of the UEFA Euro 2020 Final between Italy and England, thousands of England fans gathered at Wembley Stadium throughout the morning and afternoon, which prompted the police to urge anyone without tickets to not travel there.[313] Two hours before the final, footage showed hundreds of fans fighting with stewards and police as they attempted to force their way past barriers to get into the stadium.[314][315] Around 400 people managed to gain access to the stadium, in block 104, without paying for a ticket.[316] Huge crowds gathered in Leicester Square throwing bottles and other objects, and Trafalgar Square, where a ticketed fan zone was set up.[317] As a result of the violence and disorder, a total of 86 people were arrested by police, 53 of which were made at Wembley stadium for a number of offences, including public order breaches, assault, drunk and disorderly conduct and criminal damage.[318][319][320] 19 police officers were injured, including one who lost a tooth and another suffered a broken hand.[316][321]\n\n\nOn 12 July 2021, a day after the final, the Football Association said it would conduct a full review into how people without tickets were able to breach security and gain access to Wembley stadium for the Euro 2020 final.[322][323][324] On 13 July 2021, following the chaotic scenes, UEFA opened a disciplinary case against the Football Association for the invasion of the pitch by an England supporter, throwing of objects by supporters, disturbances during the Italian national anthem, and the use of pyrotechnics.[325][326][327]\n\n\nOn 18 October 2021, UEFA punished the Football Association (FA) for the unrest at the final by ordering England to play their next UEFA competition match behind closed doors.[328] UEFA also imposed a ban for a second game, suspended for two years, and fined the FA £84,560 (€100,000) for the lack of order and discipline inside and around the stadium, for the invasion of the field of play, for the throwing of objects and for the disturbances during the national anthems.[329]\n\n\n\n#### Online racist abuse after final[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: UEFA Euro 2020 Final § Player abuse online\n\nEngland football players Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho, and Marcus Rashford were subjected to racist abuse online after missing penalties in England's Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy.[330][331] The three football players took the last three penalties, two of which were saved by Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, during England's 3–2 loss on penalties on Sunday 11 July 2021, and were all immediately targeted with racist language and emojis on their social media accounts.[332][333]\n\n\nThe Football Association condemned the racist abuse and said it was \"appalled by the online racism\" aimed at some players on social media.[334] In a statement, it said: \"We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse.\"[335]\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Police began investigating the abuse and said on Twitter that the abuse was \"totally unacceptable\" and it would not be tolerated.[336] British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer, and the Football Association president Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, also condemned the racist abuse.[337][338]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament was admired for its high scoring,[339][340] with 2.78 goals per game a record for any European Championship since the introduction of the group stage in 1980.[341] Two of the highest-scoring games at the European Championship occurred during the tournament. 18 goals scored across four group stage matches on 23 June 2021 were a tournament record,[342] whereas 14 goals scored in the Croatia vs Spain and France vs Switzerland matches on 28 June 2021 made it the highest-scoring day in knockout stages and the second highest overall.[343]\n\n\nThe \"light touch\" officiating was also well received, with a perception that referees aimed to keep play moving.[344][345]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2018–20\". *UEFA.com*.

It was held in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016.[4][5] Spain were the two-time defending champions, having won the 2008 and 2012 tournaments, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Italy. Portugal won the tournament for the first time, following a 1–0 victory after extra time over the host team, France, in the final played at the Stade de France.\n\n\nFor the first time, the European Championship final tournament was contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[6] Under the new format, the finalists contested a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout phase including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France in the final tournament, who qualified automatically as host; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four finalist spots.\n\n\nFrance was chosen as the host nation on 28 May 2010, after a bidding process in which they beat Italy and Turkey for the right to host the 2016 finals.[7][8] The matches were played in ten stadiums in ten cities: Bordeaux, Lens, Lille Métropole, Décines-Charpieu, Marseille, Nice, Paris, Saint-Denis, Saint-Étienne, and Toulouse. It was the third time that France hosted the finals, after the inaugural tournament in 1960 and the 1984 finals.\n\n\nAs the winners, Portugal earned the right to compete at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 bids\n\nFour bids came before the deadline on 9 March 2009. France, Italy and Turkey put in single bids while Norway and Sweden put in a joint bid.[10] Norway and Sweden eventually withdrew their bid in December 2009.[11]\n\n\nThe host was selected on 28 May 2010.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting results[13]\n| Country\n | Round\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st (points)\n | 2nd (votes)\n |\n| ![](image) France\n | 43\n | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey\n | 38\n | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Italy\n | 23\n | –\n |\n| Total\n | 104\n | 13\n |\n\n\n* Round 1: Each of the thirteen members of the UEFA Executive Committee ranked the 3 bids first, second, and third.

Gibraltar competed in a European Championship qualifying for the first time since their affiliation to UEFA in 2013. The seeding pots were formed on the basis of the UEFA national team coefficients, with the Euro 2012 champions Spain and hosts France automatically top seeded.\n\n\nThe 53 national sides were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five teams. The group winners, runners-up, and the best third-placed team (with the results against the sixth-placed team discarded) qualify directly for the final tournament. The remaining eight third-placed teams contested two-legged play-offs to determine the last four qualifiers.[14][15][16]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Gianni Infantino, the UEFA general secretary at the time, stated that UEFA would review the qualification competition to ensure that it was not \"boring\".[17] In September 2011, during UEFA's first full strategy meeting, Michel Platini proposed a qualification format involving two group stages, but the member associations did not accept the proposal.[18] In May 2013, Platini confirmed a similar qualifying format would be again discussed during the September 2013 UEFA executive committee meeting in Dubrovnik.[19]\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThirteen of the sixteen teams (including hosts France) that qualified for Euro 2012 qualified again for the 2016 final tournament. Among them were England, who became only the sixth team to record a flawless qualifying campaign (10 wins in 10 matches),[20] defending European champions Spain, and world champions Germany, who qualified for their 12th straight European Championship finals.[21]\n\n\nRomania, Turkey, Austria and Switzerland all returned after missing out in 2012, with the Austrians qualifying for just their second final Euro tournament, after having co-hosted Euro 2008.[22] Returning to the final tournament after long absences were Belgium for the first time since co-hosting Euro 2000, and Hungary for the first time in 44 years, having last appeared at Euro 1972, and 30 years since appearing in a major tournament, their previous one being the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nFive teams secured their first qualification to a UEFA European Championship final tournament: Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales.[22] Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales had each previously competed in the FIFA World Cup, while Albania and Iceland had never participated in a major tournament.[22] Similarly, both Austria and Ukraine completed successful qualification campaigns for the first time, having only previously qualified as hosts (of 2008 and 2012 respectively).\n\n\nScotland were the only team from the British Isles not to qualify for the finals,[23] and it also marked the first time that both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland qualified for the same major tournament finals.[24] Greece, champions in 2004, finished bottom in their group and failed to qualify for the first time since 2000. Two other previous champions, the Netherlands (1988) and Denmark (1992), missed out on the finals. The Dutch team failed to qualify for the first time since Euro 1984 (also held in France), missing out on their first major tournament since the 2002 FIFA World Cup and only 16 months after having finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[25] Denmark did not appear at the Euro finals for the first time since 2008, after losing in the play-off round against Sweden.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 28 May 2010 | 8 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group E winner | 5 September 2015 | 8 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000, 2004, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group A winner | 6 September 2015 | 8 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Iceland | Group A runner-up | 6 September 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | Group G winner | 8 September 2015 | 1 (*2008*)\n |\n| ![](image) Northern Ireland | Group F winner | 8 October 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group I winner | 8 October 2015 | 6 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group C winner | 9 October 2015 | 9 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, **2008**, **2012**)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group E runner-up | 9 October 2015 | 3 (1996, 2004, *2008*)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group H winner | 10 October 2015 | 8 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group B winner | 10 October 2015 | 4 (*1972*, 1980, 1984, *2000*)\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | Group B runner-up | 10 October 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group F runner-up | 11 October 2015 | 4 (1984, 1996, 2000, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | Group I runner-up | 11 October 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group D winner | 11 October 2015 | 11 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Group D runner-up | 11 October 2015 | 2 (2008, *2012*)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[D] | Group G runner-up | 12 October 2015 | 10 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia[B] | Group C runner-up | 12 October 2015 | 3 (1960, **1976**, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group H runner-up | 13 October 2015 | 4 (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Best third-placed team | 13 October 2015 | 3 (1996, 2000, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Play-off winner | 15 November 2015 | 2 (1964, 1972)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Play-off winner | 16 November 2015 | 2 (1988, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Play-off winner | 17 November 2015 | 5 (*1992*, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Play-off winner | 17 November 2015 | 1 (*2012*)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** From 1960 to 1980, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia competed as Czechoslovakia.[26]\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the finals took place at the Palais des Congrès de la Porte Maillot in Paris on 12 December 2015, 18:00 CET.[4][5][27][28] The 24 qualified teams were drawn into six groups of four teams, with the hosts France being automatically placed in position A1. The remaining teams were seeded into four pots of five (Pot 1) or six teams (Pots 2, 3 and 4). As the title holders, Spain were seeded in Pot 1, while the other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015.[29][30][31][32]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Spain (holders)[b] | 37,962 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 40,236 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) England | 35,963 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 35,138 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | 34,442 | 5\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Italy | 34,345 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 31,345 | 9\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 31,254 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | 30,932 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 30,642 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 30,313 | 14\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 29,403 | 15\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 29,028 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 28,306 | 17\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 28,038 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | 27,171 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | 27,142 | 20\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 27,033 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 26,902 | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Iceland | 25,388 | 27\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | 24,531 | 28\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 23,216 | 31\n |\n| ![](image) Northern Ireland | 22,961 | 33\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Hosts France (coefficient 33,599; rank 8th) belonged to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position.

Initially, twelve stadiums were presented for the French bid, chosen on 28 May 2010. These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used.[33][34] The French Football Federation had to choose which nine would actually be used.\n\n\nThe choice for the first seven was undisputed – the national Stade de France, four newly constructed ones in Lille Metropole (Villeneuve-d'Ascq), Décines-Charpieu (Lyon Metropolis), Nice and Bordeaux, and two stadiums in the two largest cities, Paris and Marseille. After Strasbourg opted out for financial reasons following relegation,[35] two more venues were selected to be Lens and Nancy, leaving Saint-Étienne and Toulouse as reserve options.\n\n\nIn June 2011, the number of host venues was increased to eleven due to the new tournament format featuring 24 teams, instead of the previous 16.[36][37] The decision meant that the reserve cities of Toulouse and Saint-Étienne joined the list of hosts. Then, in December 2011, Nancy announced its withdrawal from the tournament, after plans for the stadium's renovation were cancelled,[38] finalising the list of host venues at ten.\n\n\nTwo other possible options, the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes and the Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier (venues which were used for the 1998 World Cup) were not chosen. The final list was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 25 January 2013.[39] Capacity figures are those for matches at UEFA Euro 2016 and are not necessarily the total capacity that the venues are capable of holding.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris(Saint-Denis) | Marseille | Lyon(Décines-Charpieu) | Lille(Villeneuve-d'Ascq) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stade de France | Stade Vélodrome | Parc Olympique Lyonnais | Stade Pierre-Mauroy |\n| Capacity: **81,338** | Capacity: **67,394** | Capacity: **59,286** | Capacity: **50,186** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Paris | ![UEFA Euro 2016 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\n**Lyon**\n![Lille](image)\nLille\n![Bordeaux](image)\nBordeaux\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nice](image)\nNice\n![Toulouse](image)\nToulouse\n | Bordeaux |\n| Parc des Princes | Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux |\n| Capacity: **48,712** | Capacity: **42,115** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Saint-Étienne | Lens | Nice | Toulouse |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard | Stade Bollaert-Delelis | Stade de Nice | Stadium Municipal |\n| Capacity: **41,965** | Capacity: **38,223** | Capacity: **35,624** | Capacity: **33,150** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. From an initial list of 66 bases, the 24 participating teams had to confirm their selection with UEFA by 31 January 2016.[40]\n\n\nThe selected team base camps were announced on 2 March 2016:[41]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Albania\n | Perros-Guirec |\n| Austria\n | Mallemort |\n| Belgium\n | Bordeaux/Le Pian-Médoc |\n| Croatia\n | Deauville/Cœur Côte Fleurie\n |\n| Czech Republic\n | Tours |\n| England\n | Chantilly |\n| France\n | Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines |\n| Germany\n | Évian-les-Bains |\n| Hungary\n | Tourrettes |\n| Iceland\n | Annecy/Annecy-le-Vieux |\n| Italy\n | Grammont/Montpellier |\n| Northern Ireland\n | Saint-Georges-de-Reneins |\n| Poland\n | La Baule-Escoublac |\n| Portugal\n | Marcoussis |\n| Republic of Ireland\n | Versailles |\n| Romania\n | Orry-la-Ville |\n| Russia\n | Croissy-sur-Seine |\n| Slovakia\n | Vichy |\n| Spain\n | Saint-Martin-de-Ré |\n| Sweden\n | Saint-Nazaire/Pornichet |\n| Switzerland\n | Montpellier/Juvignac |\n| Turkey\n | Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer |\n| Ukraine\n | Aix-en-Provence |\n| Wales\n | Dinard |\n\n\n## Finals format[edit]\n\n\nTo accommodate the expansion from a 16-team finals tournament to 24 teams, the format was changed from the one used in 2012 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phase. The six groups (A to F) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. In the new format, however, the four best third-ranked sides also progressed, leaving 16 teams going into the new round of 16 knockout phase (ahead of the usual quarter-finals, semi-finals and final), and only eight teams going out after the group stage.[17] The format was the same as the one which was applied to the 1986, 1990, and 1994 FIFA World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\nThis format generated a total of 51 matches, compared with 31 matches for the previous 16-team tournament, played over a period of 31 days. UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they needed to progress out of the group; this led to the risk of a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually beneficial collusion between teams.[17]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.[42] If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.[16]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 December 2015, UEFA named eighteen referees for Euro 2016.[43] The full referee teams were announced on 1 March 2016.[44][45] England was the only country to have two referees in the tournament.\n\n\nHungarian referee Viktor Kassai was chosen to officiate the opener between France and Romania.[46] English referee Mark Clattenburg was chosen to officiate the final between Portugal and France.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | Referee | Assistant referees | Additional assistant referees | Matches assigned[46]

June 2016, 20:00 CEST, the opening ceremony of the tournament was held. The ceremony featuring 600 dancers, 150 of which were involved in a traditional French dance before an uptempo version of \"La Vie en rose\" by French singer Édith Piaf was played. Following this, French DJ David Guetta took to the stage, he performed shortened versions of some of his hits before he was joined on stage by Swedish singer Zara Larsson to perform the official song of the tournament \"This One's for You\".\n\n\n\nDavid Guetta's setlist[51]\n1. \"I Gotta Feeling\"\n2. \"Play Hard\"\n3. \"Bang My Head\"\n4. \"Titanium\"\n5. \"This One's for You\" (with Zara Larsson)\n\nThe ceremony ended with a fly over from the Patrouille Acrobatique de France of the French Air Force, trailing the French blue, white, and red. The ceremony also featured a tribute to the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks. Following the ceremony, the hosts France beat Romania 2-1 in the opening game of the tournament.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Result of teams participating in UEFA Euro 2016 |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winner\n Runner-up\n | Semi-finals\n Quarter-finals\n | Round of 16\nGroup stage\n |\n\nUEFA announced the tournament schedule on 25 April 2014,[54][55] which was confirmed on 12 December 2015, after the final draw.[56]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the Round of 16.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria would be applied:[16]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking (e.g. if criteria 1 to 3 were applied to three teams that were level on points initially and these criteria separated one team from the other two who still have an equal ranking), criteria 1 to 3 would be reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 would apply;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. If only two teams had the same number of points, and they were tied according to criteria 1–6 after having met in the last round of the group stage, their ranking would be determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion would not be used if more than two teams had the same number of points.);\n8. Fair play conduct (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card);\n9. Position in the UEFA national team coefficient ranking system.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) France (H) | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | +1\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Albania | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | −2\n | 3\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Romania | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | −2\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts\n\n10 June 2016 (2016-06-10)\n21:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Romania |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Giroud ![](image) 57'\n* Payet ![](image) 89'\n | Report | * Stancu ![](image) 65' (pen.)\n |\n\nStade de France, Saint-Denis\nAttendance: 75,113[57]\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n11 June 2016 (2016-06-11)\n15:00\n\n\n| Albania ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Schär ![](image) 5'\n |\n\nStade Bollaert-Delelis, Lens\nAttendance: 33,805[58]\nReferee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2016 (2016-06-15)\n18:00\n\n\n| Romania ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Stancu ![](image) 18' (pen.)\n | Report | * Mehmedi ![](image) 57'\n |\n\nParc des Princes, Paris\nAttendance: 43,576[59]\nReferee: Sergei Karasev (Russia)\n\n15 June 2016 (2016-06-15)\n21:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Albania |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Griezmann ![](image) 90'\n* Payet ![](image) 90+6'\n | Report |  |\n\nStade Vélodrome, Marseille\nAttendance: 63,670[60]\nReferee: Willie Collum (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2016 (2016-06-19)\n21:00\n\n\n| Romania ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Albania |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Sadiku ![](image) 43'\n |\n\nParc Olympique Lyonnais, Décines-Charpieu\nAttendance: 49,752[61]\nReferee: Pavel Královec (Czech Republic)\n\n19 June 2016 (2016-06-19)\n21:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nStade Pierre-Mauroy, Villeneuve-d'Ascq\nAttendance: 45,616[62]\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 Group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Wales | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 6\n | 3\n | +3\n | 6\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) England | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | +1\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Slovakia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Russia | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 6\n | −4\n | 1\n |  |\n\nSource: UEFA\n\n11 June 2016 (2016-06-11)\n18:00\n\n\n| Wales ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Slovakia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Bale ![](image) 10'\n* Robson-Kanu ![](image) 81'\n | Report | * Duda ![](image) 61'\n |\n\nNouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Bordeaux\nAttendance: 37,831[63]\nReferee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway)\n\n11 June 2016 (2016-06-11)\n21:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) Russia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Dier ![](image) 73'\n | Report | * V.

Noël Le Graët, president of the French Football Federation, explained that the concern for security had increased following the attacks. He claimed: \"there was already a concern for the Euros, now it's obviously a lot higher. We will continue to do everything we can so that security is assured despite all the risks that this entails. I know that everyone is vigilant. Obviously, this means that we will now be even more vigilant. But it's a permanent concern for the federation and the [French] state\".[116]\n\n\nA \"suspicious vehicle\" near the Stade de France was destroyed by a police-mandated controlled explosion on 3 July, hours before the venue held the quarter-final between France and Iceland.[117]\n\n\n\n### Hooliganism[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Violence at UEFA Euro 2016\n\nThe day before the tournament, fighting broke out between local youths and England fans in Marseille; police dispersed the local youths with tear gas. On 10 June, English fans at Marseille clashed with police.[118] Six English fans were later arrested and sentenced to prison.[119] On 11 June, violent clashes erupted in the streets of the same city before and after the Group B match between England and Russia that ended in a 1–1 draw.[120] One English fan was reported to be critically ill in the hospital while dozens of others were injured in the clashes.[121] On 14 June, the Russian team were given a suspended disqualification, fined €150,000, and warned that future violence would result in their removal from the cup. Additionally, 50 Russian fans were deported. The English team was also warned about disqualification, but was not formally charged.[122][123] Violence between English and Russian fans arose again in Lille, where a total of 36 fans were arrested, and 16 people were hospitalised.[124]\n\n\nLate in the Group D match between the Czech Republic and Croatia, flares were thrown onto the pitch from where Croatia supporters were massed. The match was paused for several minutes while they were cleared up. There was also fighting in the Croatia supporters' area.[125] Later that same day, there was violence involving Turkish fans after Turkey's defeat by Spain. As a result of these incidents and earlier crowd troubles after the countries' first matches, UEFA launched official procedures against the Croatian and Turkish football federations.[126] The Croatian federation was fined €100,000 for the incidents.[127]\n\n\n\n### Pitch quality[edit]\n\n\nThe football pitches at French stadiums were criticised during the group stage for their poor quality. France coach Didier Deschamps was especially critical.[128][129] UEFA tournament director Martin Kallen blamed heavy rain for damaged turf, though the press speculated that non-football events may have also been a contributor.[130][131]\n\n\nThe pitch at Lille received particular attention with players slipping continuously and with groundsmen forced at halftime to try to repair the cut up pitch.[132] Despite UEFA applying numerous methods to rectify the problems, such as a ban on pre-match training on the pitch, use of fertilisers, seeding, mowing, light therapy, drying and playing with the roof closed to avoid rain, it was decided that the pitch at Lille had to be entirely replaced following the Italy–Republic of Ireland group match on 22 June.[133] The new pitch was replaced with Dutch grass and was ready before the last sixteen match between Germany and Slovakia on 26 June.[134][135][136] UEFA also stated that repair work was also required at the St Denis and Marseille pitches.[137] This was the second time that a Euro championship pitch needed to be re-laid mid-tournament. The first time was the St. Jakob-Park in Basel during Euro 2008.[138]\n\n\nUEFA's Leeds-based consultant Richard Hayden had come under criticism as it was reported he ordered local groundsmen to re-lay three pitches (Lille, Nice, and Marseille) with Slovak grass, provided by an Austrian company for an estimated €600,000 (£460,000). On 22 June it was reported that France's grass association officials had blamed Hayden for continued problems with the pitches, citing \"it is amazing that it is only these pitches that have problems today\".[139] The Austrian manufacture of the turf, Richter, responded to the French grass association officials by saying \"the turf for the stadiums in Lille and Marseille was delivered in top condition\" and that \"the turf placement and further care were handled by French companies and no one other than the French grounds-people had control over the grounds condition\".[140][141] In a statement, UEFA rejected the criticism against Hayden as baseless and stated they were satisfied with his work.[137]\n\n\n\n### Moths[edit]\n\n\nBefore the final match started, the stadium was invaded by Silver Y moths, which caused some irritation to the players, staff and coaches. The reason this occurred is because the workers at the stadium left the lights switched on the day before the match which attracted huge swaths of insects. The players and coaches of each team during the warm-up tried swatting the moths, and ground staff used brushes to clean moths from the walls, ground and other places.[142][143] One moth was infamously captured flying on and around Cristiano Ronaldo's face when he was sitting on the pitch after being injured during the match.[144]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2016 video game was released by Konami as a free DLC on *Pro Evolution Soccer 2016*.[145][146] The DLC was available for existing *Pro Evolution Soccer 2016* members on 24 March 2016 for major platforms (PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows).[147] The game was released physically and digitally on 21 April for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 users.[147]\n\n\n\n### Logo and slogan[edit]\n\n\nThe official logo was unveiled on 26 June 2013, during a ceremony at the Pavillon Cambon Capucines in Paris.[148] Conceived by Portuguese agency Brandia Central, which also created the visual identity for the previous European Championship, the design is based on the theme \"Celebrating the art of football\". The logo depicts the Henri Delaunay Trophy with the blue, white and red colours of the French flag, surrounded by a mixture of shapes and lines representing different artistic movements and football elements.[149]\n\n\nOn 17 October 2013, UEFA announced the official slogan of the tournament: *Le Rendez-Vous*. Asked about its meaning, Jacques Lambert, chairman of the Euro 2016 organising committee, told that the slogan \"is much more than a reminder of dates (...) and venues\". He further explained that \"UEFA is sending out an invitation to football fans throughout the world and to lovers of major events, an invitation to meet up and share the emotions of an elite-level tournament\".[150]\n\n\n\n### Match balls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Beau Jeu\n\nFor the first time in the tournament's history, two official match balls were used.[151] The Adidas Beau Jeu, used for the group stage, was unveiled on 12 November 2015 by former France player Zinedine Zidane.[152] During the tournament, the Adidas Fracas was introduced as the exclusive match ball for the knockout rounds.[151]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the tournament, *Super Victor*, was unveiled on 18 November 2014.[153] He is a child superhero in the kit of the France national football team, with a red cape at the back, to echo the colours of the flag of France. The cape, boots and ball are claimed to be the child's superpowers. The mascot first appeared during the match between France and Sweden at the Stade Vélodrome, Marseille on 18 November 2014. The name of the mascot was revealed on 30 November 2014 after receiving about 50,000 votes from the public on the official UEFA website, beating the other nominated names of \"Driblou\" and \"Goalix\".[154] It is based on the idea of victory and references the boy's super powers that he gained when he found the magic cape, boots and ball.[155]\n\n\nThe name of the mascot is the same as the name of a sex toy. UEFA said that this 'coincidence' was not their responsibility because the name was selected by fan voting.[156]\n\n\n\n### Official songs[edit]\n\n\nThe competition's official opening song was \"This One's for You\" by David Guetta featuring Zara Larsson, and the official closing song was \"Free Your Mind\" by Maya Lavelle.[157][158][159] It was reported that David Guetta sought one million fans to add their voices to the official anthem via a website.[160]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turkish Airlines aeroplane, decorated with UEFA EURO 2016 emblems.\n\n\n| Global sponsors\n | National sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[161]\n* Carlsberg[162]\n* Coca-Cola[163]\n* Continental[164]\n* Hisense[165]\n | * Hyundai–Kia[166]\n* McDonald's[167]\n* Orange[168]\n* SOCAR[169]\n* Turkish Airlines[170]\n\n\n |\n | |  |\n| --- |\n| * Abritel–HomeAway[171]\n* Crédit Agricole[172]\n* Française des Jeux[173]\n* La Poste[174]\n* PROMAN[175]\n* SNCF[176]\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 broadcasting rights\n\nThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the Paris expo Porte de Versailles in Paris' 15th arrondissement.[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"France forward Antoine Griezmann wins Golden Boot\".

It was held in France from 10 June to 10 July 2016.[4][5] Spain were the two-time defending champions, having won the 2008 and 2012 tournaments, but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Italy. Portugal won the tournament for the first time, following a 1–0 victory after extra time over the host team, France, in the final played at the Stade de France.\n\n\nFor the first time, the European Championship final tournament was contested by 24 teams, having been expanded from the 16-team format used since 1996.[6] Under the new format, the finalists contested a group stage consisting of six groups of four teams, followed by a knockout phase including three rounds and the final. Nineteen teams – the top two from each of the nine qualifying groups and the best third-placed team – joined France in the final tournament, who qualified automatically as host; a series of two-legged play-off ties between the remaining third-placed teams in November 2015 decided the last four finalist spots.\n\n\nFrance was chosen as the host nation on 28 May 2010, after a bidding process in which they beat Italy and Turkey for the right to host the 2016 finals.[7][8] The matches were played in ten stadiums in ten cities: Bordeaux, Lens, Lille Métropole, Décines-Charpieu, Marseille, Nice, Paris, Saint-Denis, Saint-Étienne, and Toulouse. It was the third time that France hosted the finals, after the inaugural tournament in 1960 and the 1984 finals.\n\n\nAs the winners, Portugal earned the right to compete at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 bids\n\nFour bids came before the deadline on 9 March 2009. France, Italy and Turkey put in single bids while Norway and Sweden put in a joint bid.[10] Norway and Sweden eventually withdrew their bid in December 2009.[11]\n\n\nThe host was selected on 28 May 2010.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\nVoting results[13]\n| Country\n | Round\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st (points)\n | 2nd (votes)\n |\n| ![](image) France\n | 43\n | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey\n | 38\n | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Italy\n | 23\n | –\n |\n| Total\n | 104\n | 13\n |\n\n\n* Round 1: Each of the thirteen members of the UEFA Executive Committee ranked the 3 bids first, second, and third.

Executive members from the countries bidding were not allowed to vote.\n* Round 2: The same thirteen-member committee voted for either of the two finalists.\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying\n\n![](image)Team qualified for UEFA Euro 2016\n Team failed to qualify\n\nThe qualifying draw took place at the Palais des Congrès Acropolis in Nice, on 23 February 2014,[5] with the first matches being played in September 2014.[4]\n\n\n53 teams competed for 23 places in the final tournament to join France, who automatically qualified as hosts. Gibraltar competed in a European Championship qualifying for the first time since their affiliation to UEFA in 2013. The seeding pots were formed on the basis of the UEFA national team coefficients, with the Euro 2012 champions Spain and hosts France automatically top seeded.\n\n\nThe 53 national sides were drawn into eight groups of six teams and one group of five teams. The group winners, runners-up, and the best third-placed team (with the results against the sixth-placed team discarded) qualify directly for the final tournament. The remaining eight third-placed teams contested two-legged play-offs to determine the last four qualifiers.[14][15][16]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Gianni Infantino, the UEFA general secretary at the time, stated that UEFA would review the qualification competition to ensure that it was not \"boring\".[17] In September 2011, during UEFA's first full strategy meeting, Michel Platini proposed a qualification format involving two group stages, but the member associations did not accept the proposal.[18] In May 2013, Platini confirmed a similar qualifying format would be again discussed during the September 2013 UEFA executive committee meeting in Dubrovnik.[19]\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThirteen of the sixteen teams (including hosts France) that qualified for Euro 2012 qualified again for the 2016 final tournament. Among them were England, who became only the sixth team to record a flawless qualifying campaign (10 wins in 10 matches),[20] defending European champions Spain, and world champions Germany, who qualified for their 12th straight European Championship finals.[21]\n\n\nRomania, Turkey, Austria and Switzerland all returned after missing out in 2012, with the Austrians qualifying for just their second final Euro tournament, after having co-hosted Euro 2008.[22] Returning to the final tournament after long absences were Belgium for the first time since co-hosting Euro 2000, and Hungary for the first time in 44 years, having last appeared at Euro 1972, and 30 years since appearing in a major tournament, their previous one being the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nFive teams secured their first qualification to a UEFA European Championship final tournament: Albania, Iceland, Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales.[22] Northern Ireland, Slovakia and Wales had each previously competed in the FIFA World Cup, while Albania and Iceland had never participated in a major tournament.[22] Similarly, both Austria and Ukraine completed successful qualification campaigns for the first time, having only previously qualified as hosts (of 2008 and 2012 respectively).\n\n\nScotland were the only team from the British Isles not to qualify for the finals,[23] and it also marked the first time that both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland qualified for the same major tournament finals.[24] Greece, champions in 2004, finished bottom in their group and failed to qualify for the first time since 2000. Two other previous champions, the Netherlands (1988) and Denmark (1992), missed out on the finals. The Dutch team failed to qualify for the first time since Euro 1984 (also held in France), missing out on their first major tournament since the 2002 FIFA World Cup and only 16 months after having finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[25] Denmark did not appear at the Euro finals for the first time since 2008, after losing in the play-off round against Sweden.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 28 May 2010 | 8 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group E winner | 5 September 2015 | 8 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000, 2004, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group A winner | 6 September 2015 | 8 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Iceland | Group A runner-up | 6 September 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | Group G winner | 8 September 2015 | 1 (*2008*)\n |\n| ![](image) Northern Ireland | Group F winner | 8 October 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group I winner | 8 October 2015 | 6 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group C winner | 9 October 2015 | 9 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, **2008**, **2012**)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group E runner-up | 9 October 2015 | 3 (1996, 2004, *2008*)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group H winner | 10 October 2015 | 8 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group B winner | 10 October 2015 | 4 (*1972*, 1980, 1984, *2000*)\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | Group B runner-up | 10 October 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group F runner-up | 11 October 2015 | 4 (1984, 1996, 2000, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | Group I runner-up | 11 October 2015 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group D winner | 11 October 2015 | 11 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Group D runner-up | 11 October 2015 | 2 (2008, *2012*)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[D] | Group G runner-up | 12 October 2015 | 10 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia[B] | Group C runner-up | 12 October 2015 | 3 (1960, **1976**, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group H runner-up | 13 October 2015 | 4 (1996, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Best third-placed team | 13 October 2015 | 3 (1996, 2000, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Play-off winner | 15 November 2015 | 2 (1964, 1972)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Play-off winner | 16 November 2015 | 2 (1988, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Play-off winner | 17 November 2015 | 5 (*1992*, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Play-off winner | 17 November 2015 | 1 (*2012*)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** From 1960 to 1980, both the Czech Republic and Slovakia competed as Czechoslovakia.[26]\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the finals took place at the Palais des Congrès de la Porte Maillot in Paris on 12 December 2015, 18:00 CET.[4][5][27][28] The 24 qualified teams were drawn into six groups of four teams, with the hosts France being automatically placed in position A1. The remaining teams were seeded into four pots of five (Pot 1) or six teams (Pots 2, 3 and 4). As the title holders, Spain were seeded in Pot 1, while the other 22 teams were seeded according to the UEFA national team coefficients updated after the completion of the qualifying group stage (excluding the play-offs), which were released by UEFA on 14 October 2015.[29][30][31][32]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Spain (holders)[b] | 37,962 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 40,236 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) England | 35,963 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 35,138 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | 34,442 | 5\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Italy | 34,345 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 31,345 | 9\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 31,254 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Austria | 30,932 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 30,642 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 30,313 | 14\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 29,403 | 15\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 29,028 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 28,306 | 17\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 28,038 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | 27,171 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | 27,142 | 20\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[32] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 27,033 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 26,902 | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Iceland | 25,388 | 27\n |\n| ![](image) Wales | 24,531 | 28\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 23,216 | 31\n |\n| ![](image) Northern Ireland | 22,961 | 33\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Hosts France (coefficient 33,599; rank 8th) belonged to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position.

Initially, twelve stadiums were presented for the French bid, chosen on 28 May 2010. These venues were to be whittled down to nine by the end of May 2011, but it was suggested in June 2011 that eleven venues might be used.[33][34] The French Football Federation had to choose which nine would actually be used.\n\n\nThe choice for the first seven was undisputed – the national Stade de France, four newly constructed ones in Lille Metropole (Villeneuve-d'Ascq), Décines-Charpieu (Lyon Metropolis), Nice and Bordeaux, and two stadiums in the two largest cities, Paris and Marseille. After Strasbourg opted out for financial reasons following relegation,[35] two more venues were selected to be Lens and Nancy, leaving Saint-Étienne and Toulouse as reserve options.\n\n\nIn June 2011, the number of host venues was increased to eleven due to the new tournament format featuring 24 teams, instead of the previous 16.[36][37] The decision meant that the reserve cities of Toulouse and Saint-Étienne joined the list of hosts. Then, in December 2011, Nancy announced its withdrawal from the tournament, after plans for the stadium's renovation were cancelled,[38] finalising the list of host venues at ten.\n\n\nTwo other possible options, the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes and the Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier (venues which were used for the 1998 World Cup) were not chosen. The final list was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee on 25 January 2013.[39] Capacity figures are those for matches at UEFA Euro 2016 and are not necessarily the total capacity that the venues are capable of holding.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris(Saint-Denis) | Marseille | Lyon(Décines-Charpieu) | Lille(Villeneuve-d'Ascq) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stade de France | Stade Vélodrome | Parc Olympique Lyonnais | Stade Pierre-Mauroy |\n| Capacity: **81,338** | Capacity: **67,394** | Capacity: **59,286** | Capacity: **50,186** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Paris | ![UEFA Euro 2016 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\n**Lyon**\n![Lille](image)\nLille\n![Bordeaux](image)\nBordeaux\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nice](image)\nNice\n![Toulouse](image)\nToulouse\n | Bordeaux |\n| Parc des Princes | Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux |\n| Capacity: **48,712** | Capacity: **42,115** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Saint-Étienne | Lens | Nice | Toulouse |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard | Stade Bollaert-Delelis | Stade de Nice | Stadium Municipal |\n| Capacity: **41,965** | Capacity: **38,223** | Capacity: **35,624** | Capacity: **33,150** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases. From an initial list of 66 bases, the 24 participating teams had to confirm their selection with UEFA by 31 January 2016.[40]\n\n\nThe selected team base camps were announced on 2 March 2016:[41]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Albania\n | Perros-Guirec |\n| Austria\n | Mallemort |\n| Belgium\n | Bordeaux/Le Pian-Médoc |\n| Croatia\n | Deauville/Cœur Côte Fleurie\n |\n| Czech Republic\n | Tours |\n| England\n | Chantilly |\n| France\n | Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines |\n| Germany\n | Évian-les-Bains |\n| Hungary\n | Tourrettes |\n| Iceland\n | Annecy/Annecy-le-Vieux |\n| Italy\n | Grammont/Montpellier |\n| Northern Ireland\n | Saint-Georges-de-Reneins |\n| Poland\n | La Baule-Escoublac |\n| Portugal\n | Marcoussis |\n| Republic of Ireland\n | Versailles |\n| Romania\n | Orry-la-Ville |\n| Russia\n | Croissy-sur-Seine |\n| Slovakia\n | Vichy |\n| Spain\n | Saint-Martin-de-Ré |\n| Sweden\n | Saint-Nazaire/Pornichet |\n| Switzerland\n | Montpellier/Juvignac |\n| Turkey\n | Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer |\n| Ukraine\n | Aix-en-Provence |\n| Wales\n | Dinard |\n\n\n## Finals format[edit]\n\n\nTo accommodate the expansion from a 16-team finals tournament to 24 teams, the format was changed from the one used in 2012 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phase. The six groups (A to F) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. In the new format, however, the four best third-ranked sides also progressed, leaving 16 teams going into the new round of 16 knockout phase (ahead of the usual quarter-finals, semi-finals and final), and only eight teams going out after the group stage.[17] The format was the same as the one which was applied to the 1986, 1990, and 1994 FIFA World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\nThis format generated a total of 51 matches, compared with 31 matches for the previous 16-team tournament, played over a period of 31 days. UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino previously described the format as \"not ideal\" due to the need for third-ranked teams in the group stage advancing, leading to difficulty in preventing situations where teams might be able to know in advance what results they needed to progress out of the group; this led to the risk of a lack of suspense for fans, or even the prospect of mutually beneficial collusion between teams.[17]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament.[42] If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.[16]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 December 2015, UEFA named eighteen referees for Euro 2016.[43] The full referee teams were announced on 1 March 2016.[44][45] England was the only country to have two referees in the tournament.\n\n\nHungarian referee Viktor Kassai was chosen to officiate the opener between France and Romania.[46] English referee Mark Clattenburg was chosen to officiate the final between Portugal and France.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | Referee | Assistant referees | Additional assistant referees | Matches assigned[46]

June 2016, 20:00 CEST, the opening ceremony of the tournament was held. The ceremony featuring 600 dancers, 150 of which were involved in a traditional French dance before an uptempo version of \"La Vie en rose\" by French singer Édith Piaf was played. Following this, French DJ David Guetta took to the stage, he performed shortened versions of some of his hits before he was joined on stage by Swedish singer Zara Larsson to perform the official song of the tournament \"This One's for You\".\n\n\n\nDavid Guetta's setlist[51]\n1. \"I Gotta Feeling\"\n2. \"Play Hard\"\n3. \"Bang My Head\"\n4. \"Titanium\"\n5. \"This One's for You\" (with Zara Larsson)\n\nThe ceremony ended with a fly over from the Patrouille Acrobatique de France of the French Air Force, trailing the French blue, white, and red. The ceremony also featured a tribute to the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks. Following the ceremony, the hosts France beat Romania 2-1 in the opening game of the tournament.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Result of teams participating in UEFA Euro 2016 |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winner\n Runner-up\n | Semi-finals\n Quarter-finals\n | Round of 16\nGroup stage\n |\n\nUEFA announced the tournament schedule on 25 April 2014,[54][55] which was confirmed on 12 December 2015, after the final draw.[56]\n\n\nGroup winners, runners-up, and the best four third-placed teams advanced to the Round of 16.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria would be applied:[16]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking (e.g. if criteria 1 to 3 were applied to three teams that were level on points initially and these criteria separated one team from the other two who still have an equal ranking), criteria 1 to 3 would be reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 would apply;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. If only two teams had the same number of points, and they were tied according to criteria 1–6 after having met in the last round of the group stage, their ranking would be determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion would not be used if more than two teams had the same number of points.);\n8. Fair play conduct (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card);\n9. Position in the UEFA national team coefficient ranking system.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) France (H) | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | +1\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Albania | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | −2\n | 3\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Romania | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | −2\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts\n\n10 June 2016 (2016-06-10)\n21:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Romania |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Giroud ![](image) 57'\n* Payet ![](image) 89'\n | Report | * Stancu ![](image) 65' (pen.)\n |\n\nStade de France, Saint-Denis\nAttendance: 75,113[57]\nReferee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary)\n\n11 June 2016 (2016-06-11)\n15:00\n\n\n| Albania ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Schär ![](image) 5'\n |\n\nStade Bollaert-Delelis, Lens\nAttendance: 33,805[58]\nReferee: Carlos Velasco Carballo (Spain)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2016 (2016-06-15)\n18:00\n\n\n| Romania ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Stancu ![](image) 18' (pen.)\n | Report | * Mehmedi ![](image) 57'\n |\n\nParc des Princes, Paris\nAttendance: 43,576[59]\nReferee: Sergei Karasev (Russia)\n\n15 June 2016 (2016-06-15)\n21:00\n\n\n| France ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Albania |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Griezmann ![](image) 90'\n* Payet ![](image) 90+6'\n | Report |  |\n\nStade Vélodrome, Marseille\nAttendance: 63,670[60]\nReferee: Willie Collum (Scotland)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2016 (2016-06-19)\n21:00\n\n\n| Romania ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Albania |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Sadiku ![](image) 43'\n |\n\nParc Olympique Lyonnais, Décines-Charpieu\nAttendance: 49,752[61]\nReferee: Pavel Královec (Czech Republic)\n\n19 June 2016 (2016-06-19)\n21:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) France |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nStade Pierre-Mauroy, Villeneuve-d'Ascq\nAttendance: 45,616[62]\nReferee: Damir Skomina (Slovenia)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 Group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Wales | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 6\n | 3\n | +3\n | 6\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) England | 3\n | 1\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 2\n | +1\n | 5\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Slovakia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Russia | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 6\n | −4\n | 1\n |  |\n\nSource: UEFA\n\n11 June 2016 (2016-06-11)\n18:00\n\n\n| Wales ![](image) | 2–1 | ![](image) Slovakia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Bale ![](image) 10'\n* Robson-Kanu ![](image) 81'\n | Report | * Duda ![](image) 61'\n |\n\nNouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Bordeaux\nAttendance: 37,831[63]\nReferee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway)\n\n11 June 2016 (2016-06-11)\n21:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–1 | ![](image) Russia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Dier ![](image) 73'\n | Report | * V.

Tournament[109]\n\nUEFA Team of the Tournament\nThe UEFA Technical Team was given the objective of naming a team of eleven players during the tournament, a change from the 23-man squads in the past competitions.[109] The group of analysts watched every game before making the decision following the final.[109] Four players from the winning Portuguese squad were named in the tournament.[109]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeeper\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forward\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Portugal](image) Rui Patrício | ![Germany](image) Jérôme Boateng![Germany](image)

technical observers, led by UEFA chief technical officer Ioan Lupescu and including Sir Alex Ferguson and Alain Giresse.\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Antoine Griezmann[2]\n\n\nYoung Player of the Tournament\nThe Young Player of the Tournament award, open to players born on or after 1 January 1994, was given to Renato Sanches who was named above Kingsley Coman and Portugal teammate Raphaël Guerreiro. The particular player, who deserved the award, was also chosen by UEFA's technical observers.\n\n\n\n* ![Portugal](image) Renato Sanches –  (1997-08-18)18 August 1997 (aged 18)[3]\n\n\nGolden Boot\nThe Golden Boot was awarded to Antoine Griezmann, who scored one goal in the group stage and five in the knockout phase.\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Antoine Griezmann – 6 goals, 2 assists (555 minutes)[1]\n\n\nSilver Boot\nThe Silver Boot was awarded to Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored two goals in the group stage and one in the knockout phase, as well as providing three assists.\n\n\n\n* ![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo – 3 goals, 3 assists (625 minutes)[1]\n\n\nBronze Boot\nThe Bronze Boot was awarded to Olivier Giroud, who scored one goal in the group stage and two in the knockout phase, as well as providing two assists; compatriot Dimitri Payet amassed the same tally, but played 50 more minutes than Giroud.\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Olivier Giroud – 3 goals, 2 assists (456 minutes)[1]\n\n\nGoal of the Tournament\nThe Goal of the Tournament was decided by online voting. A total 5 goals were in the shortlist. On 13 July 2016, after an open vote with over 150,000 entries, UEFA announced that Hungarian midfielder Zoltán Gera's goal against Portugal had been named as fans' goal of the tournament.[110] In a separate poll, UEFA's technical observers decided that Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri's goal against Poland deserved top spot in their list of the ten best goals of the tournament.[111]\n\n\n\n* Fans: ![Hungary](image) Zoltán Gera (vs Portugal)\n* Technical observers: ![Switzerland](image) Xherdan Shaqiri (vs Poland)\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPrize money\n| Rank (unoff.) | Team | € Million\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Portugal | 25.5\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) France | 23.5\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Germany | 18.5\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Wales | 18\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) Poland | 14.5\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Iceland![](image) Italy | 14\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Croatia | 12\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England![](image) Hungary![](image) Spain![](image)  Switzerland | 11.5\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Slovakia | 11\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Northern Ireland | 10.5\n |\n| 17 | ![](image) Albania![](image) Turkey | 9\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) Austria![](image) Czech Republic![](image) Romania![](image) Russia![](image) Sweden | 8.5\n |\n| 24 | ![](image) Ukraine | 8\n |\n\n\nA total of €301 million was distributed to the 24 teams contesting in the tournament, a growth from the €196 million payment in the preceding event.

Noël Le Graët, president of the French Football Federation, explained that the concern for security had increased following the attacks. He claimed: \"there was already a concern for the Euros, now it's obviously a lot higher. We will continue to do everything we can so that security is assured despite all the risks that this entails. I know that everyone is vigilant. Obviously, this means that we will now be even more vigilant. But it's a permanent concern for the federation and the [French] state\".[116]\n\n\nA \"suspicious vehicle\" near the Stade de France was destroyed by a police-mandated controlled explosion on 3 July, hours before the venue held the quarter-final between France and Iceland.[117]\n\n\n\n### Hooliganism[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Violence at UEFA Euro 2016\n\nThe day before the tournament, fighting broke out between local youths and England fans in Marseille; police dispersed the local youths with tear gas. On 10 June, English fans at Marseille clashed with police.[118] Six English fans were later arrested and sentenced to prison.[119] On 11 June, violent clashes erupted in the streets of the same city before and after the Group B match between England and Russia that ended in a 1–1 draw.[120] One English fan was reported to be critically ill in the hospital while dozens of others were injured in the clashes.[121] On 14 June, the Russian team were given a suspended disqualification, fined €150,000, and warned that future violence would result in their removal from the cup. Additionally, 50 Russian fans were deported. The English team was also warned about disqualification, but was not formally charged.[122][123] Violence between English and Russian fans arose again in Lille, where a total of 36 fans were arrested, and 16 people were hospitalised.[124]\n\n\nLate in the Group D match between the Czech Republic and Croatia, flares were thrown onto the pitch from where Croatia supporters were massed. The match was paused for several minutes while they were cleared up. There was also fighting in the Croatia supporters' area.[125] Later that same day, there was violence involving Turkish fans after Turkey's defeat by Spain. As a result of these incidents and earlier crowd troubles after the countries' first matches, UEFA launched official procedures against the Croatian and Turkish football federations.[126] The Croatian federation was fined €100,000 for the incidents.[127]\n\n\n\n### Pitch quality[edit]\n\n\nThe football pitches at French stadiums were criticised during the group stage for their poor quality. France coach Didier Deschamps was especially critical.[128][129] UEFA tournament director Martin Kallen blamed heavy rain for damaged turf, though the press speculated that non-football events may have also been a contributor.[130][131]\n\n\nThe pitch at Lille received particular attention with players slipping continuously and with groundsmen forced at halftime to try to repair the cut up pitch.[132] Despite UEFA applying numerous methods to rectify the problems, such as a ban on pre-match training on the pitch, use of fertilisers, seeding, mowing, light therapy, drying and playing with the roof closed to avoid rain, it was decided that the pitch at Lille had to be entirely replaced following the Italy–Republic of Ireland group match on 22 June.[133] The new pitch was replaced with Dutch grass and was ready before the last sixteen match between Germany and Slovakia on 26 June.[134][135][136] UEFA also stated that repair work was also required at the St Denis and Marseille pitches.[137] This was the second time that a Euro championship pitch needed to be re-laid mid-tournament. The first time was the St. Jakob-Park in Basel during Euro 2008.[138]\n\n\nUEFA's Leeds-based consultant Richard Hayden had come under criticism as it was reported he ordered local groundsmen to re-lay three pitches (Lille, Nice, and Marseille) with Slovak grass, provided by an Austrian company for an estimated €600,000 (£460,000). On 22 June it was reported that France's grass association officials had blamed Hayden for continued problems with the pitches, citing \"it is amazing that it is only these pitches that have problems today\".[139] The Austrian manufacture of the turf, Richter, responded to the French grass association officials by saying \"the turf for the stadiums in Lille and Marseille was delivered in top condition\" and that \"the turf placement and further care were handled by French companies and no one other than the French grounds-people had control over the grounds condition\".[140][141] In a statement, UEFA rejected the criticism against Hayden as baseless and stated they were satisfied with his work.[137]\n\n\n\n### Moths[edit]\n\n\nBefore the final match started, the stadium was invaded by Silver Y moths, which caused some irritation to the players, staff and coaches. The reason this occurred is because the workers at the stadium left the lights switched on the day before the match which attracted huge swaths of insects. The players and coaches of each team during the warm-up tried swatting the moths, and ground staff used brushes to clean moths from the walls, ground and other places.[142][143] One moth was infamously captured flying on and around Cristiano Ronaldo's face when he was sitting on the pitch after being injured during the match.[144]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2016 video game was released by Konami as a free DLC on *Pro Evolution Soccer 2016*.[145][146] The DLC was available for existing *Pro Evolution Soccer 2016* members on 24 March 2016 for major platforms (PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows).[147] The game was released physically and digitally on 21 April for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 users.[147]\n\n\n\n### Logo and slogan[edit]\n\n\nThe official logo was unveiled on 26 June 2013, during a ceremony at the Pavillon Cambon Capucines in Paris.[148] Conceived by Portuguese agency Brandia Central, which also created the visual identity for the previous European Championship, the design is based on the theme \"Celebrating the art of football\". The logo depicts the Henri Delaunay Trophy with the blue, white and red colours of the French flag, surrounded by a mixture of shapes and lines representing different artistic movements and football elements.[149]\n\n\nOn 17 October 2013, UEFA announced the official slogan of the tournament: *Le Rendez-Vous*. Asked about its meaning, Jacques Lambert, chairman of the Euro 2016 organising committee, told that the slogan \"is much more than a reminder of dates (...) and venues\". He further explained that \"UEFA is sending out an invitation to football fans throughout the world and to lovers of major events, an invitation to meet up and share the emotions of an elite-level tournament\".[150]\n\n\n\n### Match balls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Beau Jeu\n\nFor the first time in the tournament's history, two official match balls were used.[151] The Adidas Beau Jeu, used for the group stage, was unveiled on 12 November 2015 by former France player Zinedine Zidane.[152] During the tournament, the Adidas Fracas was introduced as the exclusive match ball for the knockout rounds.[151]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the tournament, *Super Victor*, was unveiled on 18 November 2014.[153] He is a child superhero in the kit of the France national football team, with a red cape at the back, to echo the colours of the flag of France. The cape, boots and ball are claimed to be the child's superpowers. The mascot first appeared during the match between France and Sweden at the Stade Vélodrome, Marseille on 18 November 2014. The name of the mascot was revealed on 30 November 2014 after receiving about 50,000 votes from the public on the official UEFA website, beating the other nominated names of \"Driblou\" and \"Goalix\".[154] It is based on the idea of victory and references the boy's super powers that he gained when he found the magic cape, boots and ball.[155]\n\n\nThe name of the mascot is the same as the name of a sex toy. UEFA said that this 'coincidence' was not their responsibility because the name was selected by fan voting.[156]\n\n\n\n### Official songs[edit]\n\n\nThe competition's official opening song was \"This One's for You\" by David Guetta featuring Zara Larsson, and the official closing song was \"Free Your Mind\" by Maya Lavelle.[157][158][159] It was reported that David Guetta sought one million fans to add their voices to the official anthem via a website.[160]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turkish Airlines aeroplane, decorated with UEFA EURO 2016 emblems.\n\n\n| Global sponsors\n | National sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[161]\n* Carlsberg[162]\n* Coca-Cola[163]\n* Continental[164]\n* Hisense[165]\n | * Hyundai–Kia[166]\n* McDonald's[167]\n* Orange[168]\n* SOCAR[169]\n* Turkish Airlines[170]\n\n\n |\n | |  |\n| --- |\n| * Abritel–HomeAway[171]\n* Crédit Agricole[172]\n* Française des Jeux[173]\n* La Poste[174]\n* PROMAN[175]\n* SNCF[176]\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2016 broadcasting rights\n\nThe International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the Paris expo Porte de Versailles in Paris' 15th arrondissement.[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"France forward Antoine Griezmann wins Golden Boot\".

The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine (both first time hosts), and was won by Spain, who beat Italy in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, Ukraine.[1]\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.[2] The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012).[3] Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\nThere were several players ending on a total of 3 goals but because Fernando Torres made an assist and played the fewest minutes of the players who scored three goals, he was named as the Golden Boot winner for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 bids\n\nThe hosting of the event was initially contested by five bids representing seven countries: Croatia–Hungary, Greece, Italy, Poland–Ukraine, and Turkey.[4] In November 2005, after an initial consideration of the bid data by UEFA, both the Greek and Turkish bids were eliminated from the process, to leave three candidates.[5]\n\n\nIn May 2006, this was followed by a second round of the selection process, which included visits by UEFA to all candidates.[6] The final decision was due to be announced on 8 December 2006 in Nyon, but this was postponed to \"give bidding associations more time for the fine-tuning of their bids\".[7] On 18 April 2007, the Poland–Ukraine bid was chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee, at a meeting in Cardiff.[2] It was the first time UEFA awarded the tournament organization to the former Eastern Bloc since Yugoslavia in 1976.[8]\n\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,[2] had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.[9][10][11]\n\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.[12][13] During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;[14][15] however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.[16]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.[17] Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.[18]\n\n\nTwelve of the sixteen finalists participated at the previous tournament in 2008. England and Denmark made their return to the Euro after missing out on 2008, while Republic of Ireland returned after a twenty-four-year absence to make their second appearance at a European Championship. One of the co-hosts, Ukraine, made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the Soviet Union). With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\n\nRomania and Turkey were the only teams failing to qualify for the final tournament after qualifying to UEFA Euro 2008. (Austria and Switzerland also failed to qualify, but, as hosts of the previous tournament, they didn't took part in the qualifications.)\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time Greece qualified for the European Championship finals, and the last time Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey and Wales failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:[19]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | Co-host | 18 April 2007 | 1 (2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[B] | Group A winner | 2 September 2011 | 10 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group C winner | 6 September 2011 | 7 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group E winner | 6 September 2011 | 8 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group I winner | 6 September 2011 | 8 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, **2008**)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group G winner | 7 October 2011 | 7 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[C] | Group B winner | 11 October 2011 | 9 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group D winner | 11 October 2011 | 7 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group F winner | 11 October 2011 | 3 (1980, **2004**, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group H winner | 11 October 2011 | 7 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Best runner-up | 11 October 2011 | 4 (*1992*, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 3 (1996, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[D] | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 7 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 5 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 1 (1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n3. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2011 at the Ukraine Palace of Arts in Kyiv, Ukraine.[20][21] The hour-long ceremony was hosted by Olha Freimut and Piotr Sobczyński, television presenters from the two host countries.\n\n\nAs was the case for the 2000, 2004 and 2008 finals, the sixteen finalists were divided into four seeding pots, using the UEFA national team coefficient ranking.[22] The pot allocations were based on the UEFA national team coefficient rankings of the sixteen finalists at the end of the qualifying competition in November 2011.[23] Each nation's coefficient was generated by calculating:\n\n\n\n* 40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying stage.\n* 40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage and final tournament.\n* 20% of the average ranking points per game earned in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying stage and final tournament.\n\n\nAside from the coefficient, three teams were automatically placed in Pot 1. Ukraine and Poland were both assigned to Pot 1 as the two host nations, despite the fact that their rankings were the two lowest in the tournament; this also occurred in 2008 when the co-hosts Switzerland and Austria were also ranked below all other qualified teams. As defending champions, Spain were also automatically assigned to Pot 1, though their UEFA ranking at the time of the draw was coincidentally also the best.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, one team from each pot was drawn into each of the four groups. The draw also determined which place in the group teams in pots 2–4 would take (e.g. A2, A3 or A4) to create the match schedule. With Poland automatically assigned in advance to A1, and Ukraine to D1, Pot 1 only had two teams as Spain and the Netherlands were to be drawn into position one in either group B or C.[22][24] The balls were drawn by four former players who had each been part of European Championship winning teams: Horst Hrubesch, Marco van Basten, Peter Schmeichel and Zinedine Zidane.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Spain (holders)[b] | 43,116 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 40,860 | 2\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany | 40,446 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 34,357 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) England | 33,563 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 33,212 | 6\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 33,003 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | 32,455 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 31,717 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 31,675 | 10\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 31,205 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) France | 30,508 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 29,602 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 28,576 | 14\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Co-hosts Poland (coefficient 23,806; rank 28th) and Ukraine (coefficient 28,029; rank 15th) belonged to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position. Ahead of the draw, they were removed as drawing options from Pot 1, and instead automatically assigned to Group position A1 and D1 respectively.\n2. **^** Defending champions Spain (coefficient 43,116; rank 1st) were automatically assigned to Pot 1, and could be drawn into either Group position B1 or C1.\n\nTeams were drawn consecutively into Group A to D. First, the Pot 1 teams were assigned to the first positions of their groups, while next the positions of all other teams were drawn separately from Pot 4 to 2 (for the purposes of determining the match schedules in each group).\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Poland |\n| A2 | ![](image) Greece |\n| A3 | ![](image) Russia |\n| A4 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| B3 | ![](image) Germany |\n| B4 | ![](image) Portugal |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| C2 | ![](image) Italy |\n| C3 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland |\n| C4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| D2 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| D3 | ![](image) France |\n| D4 | ![](image) England |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warsaw fan zone, view during a game, 16 June\nEight cities were selected by UEFA as host venues. In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kyiv, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.[26]\n\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kyiv, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.[27][28] Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.[29]\n\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.[30]\n\n\nA total of 31 matches were played during Euro 2012, with Ukraine hosting 16 of them and Poland 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Poland\n |\n| --- |\n| Warsaw | Wrocław | Gdańsk | Poznań |\n| Stadion Narodowy | Stadion Wrocław | PGE Arena | Stadion Miejski |\n| Capacity: **58,580** | Capacity: **45,105** | Capacity: **43,615** | Capacity: **43,269** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Poland\n![UEFA Euro 2012 is located in Poland](image)![Warsaw](image)\nWarsaw\n![Gdańsk](image)\nGdańsk\n![Poznań](image)\nPoznań\n![Wrocław](image)\nWrocław\n | Ukraine\n![UEFA Euro 2012 is located in Ukraine](image)![Kyiv](image)\nKyiv\n![Donetsk](image)\nDonetsk\n![Kharkiv](image)\nKharkiv\n![Lviv](image)\nLviv\n |\n| Ukraine\n |\n| Kyiv | Donetsk | Kharkiv | Lviv |\n| Olympic Stadium | Donbass Arena | Metalist Stadium | Arena Lviv |\n| Capacity: **70,050** | Capacity: **52,187** | Capacity: **40,003** | Capacity: **34,915** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTickets for the venues were sold directly by UEFA via its website, or distributed by the football associations of the 16 finalists. Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.[31] Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.[32] Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.[33] Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.[34]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. From an initial list of thirty-eight potential locations (twenty-one in Poland, seventeen in Ukraine),[35] the national associations chose their locations in 2011. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases.[36] Thirteen teams stayed in Poland and three in Ukraine.[36]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Croatia\n | Warka |\n| Czech Republic\n | Wrocław |\n| Denmark\n | Kołobrzeg |\n| England\n | Kraków |\n| France\n | Donetsk |\n| Germany\n | Gdańsk |\n| Greece\n | Jachranka |\n| Italy\n | Kraków |\n| Netherlands\n | Kraków |\n| Poland\n | Warsaw |\n| Portugal\n | Opalenica |\n| Republic of Ireland\n | Sopot |\n| Russia\n | Warsaw |\n| Spain\n | Gniewino |\n| Sweden\n | Kyiv |\n| Ukraine\n | Kyiv |\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Tango 12\n\n![](image)Monumental Adidas Tango 12 in Kyiv\nThe Adidas Tango 12 was the official match ball of UEFA Euro 2012.[37] The ball is named after the original Adidas Tango family of footballs; however, the Tango 12 and its variations have a completely new design. Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[38]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he would be replaced by another player.[39]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 December 2011, UEFA named twelve referees and four fourth officials for Euro 2012.[40] On 27 March 2012, UEFA issued the full list of 80 referees to be used in Euro 2012, including the assistant referees, the additional assistant referees, and the four reserve assistant referees.[41] Each refereeing team consisted of five match officials from the same country: one main referee, two assistant referees, and two additional assistant referees. All of the main referees, additional assistant referees, and fourth officials were FIFA referees, and the assistant referees (including the four reserve assistant referees) were FIFA assistant referees.[42][43] For each refereeing team, a third assistant referee from each country was named to remain on standby until the start of the tournament to take the place of a colleague if required.[43] In two cases, for the French and Slovenian refereeing teams, the standby assistant referees took the place of one of the assistant referees before the start of the tournament. Continuing the experiments carried out in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, the two additional assistant referees were used on the goal line for the first time in European Championship history with approval from the International Football Association Board.[40]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | Referee | Assistant referees | Additional assistant referees | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | Howard Webb | Michael MullarkeyPeter Kirkup[A]Stephen Child (standby) | Martin AtkinsonMark Clattenburg | Russia–Czech Republic (Group A)Italy–Croatia (Group C)Czech Republic–Portugal (Quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Stéphane Lannoy | Frédéric CanoMichaël AnnonierEric Dansault (standby) | Fredy FautrelRuddy Buquet | Germany–Portugal (Group B)Greece–Czech Republic (Group A)Germany–Italy (Semi-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | Wolfgang Stark | Jan-Hendrik SalverMike PickelMark Borsch (standby) | Florian MeyerDeniz Aytekin | Poland–Russia (Group A)Croatia–Spain (Group C)\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Viktor Kassai | Gábor ErősGyörgy RingRóbert Kispál (standby) | István VadTamás Bognár | Spain–Italy (Group C)England–Ukraine (Group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Nicola Rizzoli | Renato FaveraniAndrea StefaniLuca Maggiani (standby) | Gianluca RocchiPaolo Tagliavento | France–England (Group D)Portugal–Netherlands (Group B)Spain–France (Quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Björn Kuipers | Sander van Roekel[A]Erwin ZeinstraBerry Simons (standby) | Pol van BoekelRichard Liesveld | Republic of Ireland–Croatia (Group C)Ukraine–France (Group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Pedro Proença | Bertino MirandaRicardo SantosTiago Trigo (standby) | Jorge SousaDuarte Gomes | Spain–Republic of Ireland (Group C)Sweden–France (Group D)England–Italy (Quarter-final)Spain–Italy (Final)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Craig Thomson | Alasdair RossDerek RoseGraham Chambers (standby) | Willie CollumEuan Norris | Denmark–Portugal (Group B)Czech Republic–Poland (Group A)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | Damir Skomina | Primož ArharMatej ŽuničMarko Stančin (standby) | Matej JugSlavko Vinčić | Netherlands–Denmark (Group B)Sweden–England (Group D)Germany–Greece (Quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Carlos Velasco Carballo | Roberto Alonso FernándezJuan Carlos Yuste JiménezJesús Calvo Guadamuro (standby) | David Fernández BorbalánCarlos Clos Gómez | Poland–Greece (Group A)Denmark–Germany (Group B)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Jonas Eriksson | Stefan WittbergMathias KlaseniusFredrik Nilsson (standby) | Markus StrömbergssonStefan Johannesson | Netherlands–Germany (Group B)Greece–Russia (Group A)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Cüneyt Çakır | Bahattin DuranTarık OngunMustafa Emre Eyisoy (standby) | Hüseyin GöçekBülent Yıldırım | Ukraine–Sweden (Group D)Italy–Republic of Ireland (Group C)Portugal–Spain (Semi-final)\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Peter Kirkup was replaced by Dutch assistant Sander van Roekel for the match Czech Republic–Portugal\n\nFour match officials, who served only as fourth officials, and four reserve assistant referees were also named:[40][41]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Country | Fourth official\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Pavel Královec |\n| ![](image) Norway | Tom Harald Hagen |\n| ![](image) Poland | Marcin Borski |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Viktor Shvetsov |\n\n | \n\n| Country | Reserve assistant referee\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Damien MacGraith\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Marcin Borkowski\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Roman Slyško\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Oleksandr Voytyuk\n |\n\n\n |\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winner\n Runner-up\n | Semi-finals\n Quarter-finals\n | Group stage\n |\n\nUEFA announced the schedule for the 31 matches of the final tournament in October 2010,[44] with the final confirmation of kick-offs times being affirmed following the tournament draw in December 2011.[45]\n\n\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[39][46]\n\n\n\n1.

Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking (e.g. if criteria 1 to 3 were applied to three teams that were level on points initially and these criteria separated one team from the other two who still have an equal ranking), criteria 1 to 3 would be reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 would apply;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. If two teams tie alone (according to 1–5) after having met in the last round of the group stage their ranking is determined by penalty shoot-out.\n8. Position in the UEFA national team coefficient ranking system;\n9. Fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament);\n10. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- |

Tournament\nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament.[80] The group of eleven analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Ten players from the winning Spanish team were selected in the team of the tournament, while Zlatan Ibrahimović was the only player to be included whose team was knocked out in the group stage.[80][81]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Germany](image) Manuel Neuer![Italy](image) Gianluigi Buffon![Spain](image) Iker Casillas | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm![Portugal](image) Fábio Coentrão![Portugal](image) Pepe![Spain](image) Jordi Alba![Spain](image) Gerard Piqué![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos | ![England](image) Steven Gerrard![Germany](image) Sami Khedira![Germany](image) Mesut Özil![Italy](image) Daniele De Rossi![Italy](image) Andrea Pirlo![Spain](image) Xabi Alonso![Spain](image) Sergio Busquets![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta![Spain](image) Xavi | ![Italy](image) Mario Balotelli![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo![Spain](image) Cesc Fàbregas![Spain](image) David Silva![Sweden](image) Zlatan Ibrahimović |\n\n\n![](image)Fernando Torres (in red) in the final\nGolden Boot\nFernando Torres tied with five other players on goals and with Mario Gómez on goals and assists; however, he played 92 fewer minutes than Gómez did, thus earning the title. Torres also became the first player to score in two finals.[3]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Fernando Torres (3 goals)[82]\n\n\nUEFA Player of the Tournament\n* ![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta[80][83]\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nA total of €196 million was given to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, an increase from the €184 million in the previous tournament. Each team received an initial €8 million and then received additional money, based on their performances.[84] Spain, the winners of Euro 2012, were awarded a total prize of €23 million for their performance.[85] The maximum prize achievable (for winning all group matches and winning the final) was €23.5 million. \n\n\n\n\n\nPrize money\n| Rank (unoff.) | Team | Million €\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Spain | 23.0\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Italy | 19.5\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Germany | 16.0\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Portugal | 15.0\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) England | 12.5\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Czech Republic | 12.0\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) France, ![](image) Greece | 11.5\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Croatia, ![](image) Russia | 10.5\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Denmark, ![](image) Ukraine | 10.0\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Poland, ![](image) Sweden | 9.0\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Netherlands, ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 8.0\n |\n\n\nComplete list:\n\n\n\n* Prize for participating: €8 million\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\n\n\n* Champions: €7.5 million\n* Runner-up: €4.5 million\n* Reaching the semi-finals: €3 million\n* Reaching the quarter-finals: €2 million\n* Finishing in third place in a group: €1 million\n* Winning a group match: €1 million\n* Drawing a group match: €500,000\n\n\nBesides money, commemorative plaques were given to all participants together with special plaques for semi-final losers and finalists.\nGold and silver medals were awarded to the winners and runners-up, respectively, whereas both semi-final losers were awarded bronze medals. The trophy given to the winners remains in the ownership of UEFA; however, the winning nation, Spain, received a full-size replica.[39]\n\n\n\n## Discipline[edit]\n\n\nIn the final tournament, a player was suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary body has the ability to increase the automatic one match ban for a red card (e.g. for violent conduct). Single yellow card cautions were erased at the conclusion of the quarter-finals, and were not carried over to the semi-finals (so that a player could only be suspended for the final by getting a red card in the semi-final). Single yellow cards and suspensions for yellow card accumulations do not carry over to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament matches.[39] The following players were suspended during the final tournament – for one or more games – as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulations:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Offences\n | Suspensions\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![England](image) Wayne Rooney | ![Red card](image) in qualification v Montenegro | Group D v FranceGroup D v Sweden |\n| ![Greece](image) Sokratis Papastathopoulos | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group A v Poland | Group A v Czech Republic |\n| ![Poland](image) Wojciech Szczęsny | ![Red card](image) in Group A v Greece | Group A v Russia |\n| ![Germany](image) Jérôme Boateng | ![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Portugal![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Netherlands | Group B v Denmark |\n| ![Greece](image) Giorgos Karagounis | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Poland![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia | Quarter-final v Germany |\n| ![Greece](image) José Holebas | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Poland![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Keith Andrews | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group C v Italy | World Cup qualifying v Kazakhstan |\n| ![France](image) Philippe Mexès | ![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Ukraine![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Sweden | Quarter-final v Spain |\n| ![Italy](image) Christian Maggio | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Spain![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v England | Semi-final v Germany |\n\n\nApart from discipline measures for yellow and red cards, UEFA fined the football associations of Croatia,[86][87] England,[88] Germany,[89] Portugal, Russia,[90][91][92] and Spain a total of €417,000 for spectators incidents.[93][94][95] Furthermore, the Portuguese association was fined €5,000 for delaying the start of the second half of the game against Germany.[94] In addition to these, Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner was fined €100,000 and given a one match ban (to be applied in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament) for revealing his sponsored underpants, violating UEFA regulations, during the celebration of his second goal in the match against Portugal.[96] His fine was later paid by his sponsor.[97]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Trophy tour[edit]\n\n\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy began a journey through the host cities seven weeks before the start of the tournament. A hundred days before the first match a 35.5-metre-high (116 ft) hot air balloon in the shape of the trophy was flown in Nyon, Switzerland and visited 14 cities throughout the host countries, reminding spectators of the impending tournament. On 20 April 2012, the trophy tour started and visited the Polish cities of Warsaw, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, Kraków, Katowice and Łódź. After the Polish cities, the trophy visited seven Ukrainian cities: Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, and Odesa.[98][99]\n\n\n\n### Logo, slogan and theme songs[edit]\n\n\nThe competition slogan, **Creating History Together** (Polish: *Razem tworzymy przyszłość*, literally, \"Together we are creating the future\", Ukrainian: Творимо історію разом, *Tvorymo istoriyu razom*), was announced along with the logo. The official logo for the tournament was unveiled at a special event at Mykhailivska Square, Kyiv, on 14 December 2009 and was designed by Portuguese group Brandia Central.[100] It took its visual identity from Wycinanki or Vytynanky, a traditional form of paper cutting practised in rural areas of Poland and Ukraine. The art form symbolises the nature of the rural areas of both countries.[101][102] As part of the event, landmark buildings in the eight host cities were illuminated with the tournament logo.[103]\n\n\nThe official Euro 2012 song was \"Endless Summer\" by the German singer Oceana. In addition, UEFA retained the melody that was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on its behalf for the 2008 tournament.[104][105] The Republic of Ireland also produced an official song: \"The Rocky Road to Poland\", recorded by a collaboration of Irish performers, quickly reached number 1 in Ireland and stayed there for three weeks.[106] In Spain, the broadcasting company Mediaset España commissioned the song \"No hay 2 sin 3\", performed by David Bisbal and Cali & El Dandee and produced by RedOne.[107]\n\n\nThe tournament was also associated with the song \"Heart of Courage\" by Two Steps from Hell, which was played in the stadiums during the entrance of the players (before the national anthems);[108][109] and also \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, in this case after every goal.[110]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise and mascots[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mascots Slavek & Slavko\nUEFA signed a worldwide licensing agreement with Warner Brothers Consumer Products to help promote the tournament.[111] The agreement involved licensing to third parties for a variety of other merchandising items.\n\n\nAlso designed by Warner Bros. were the official tournament mascots, \"Slavek and Slavko\", twins that wore the national colours of the two host nations. The mascots were unveiled in December 2010,[112] and named following an online poll.[113]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nThe *UEFA Euro 2012 video game* was released by EA Sports as a downloadable expansion pack for *FIFA 12*.[114]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA announced ten global sponsors and, for both Poland and Ukraine, three national sponsors as shown below.[115] These sponsorships together with the broadcasting revenues were estimated to earn UEFA at least US$1.6 billion.[116]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global sponsors | Event sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ukraine\n | Poland\n |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas\n* Canon[117]\n* Castrol\n* Coca-Cola[118]\n* Continental[119]\n* SHARP[120]\n | * Orange[121]\n* Hyundai–Kia[122]\n* Carlsberg[123]\n* McDonald's[124]\n\n\n |\n | * Ukrtelecom\n* Epicenter\n* Ukrsotsbank PJSC[125]\n | * E. Wedel[126]\n* Bank Pekao\n* MasterCard\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 broadcasting rights\n\nAccording to UEFA requirements, TP ensured approximately 2х70 Gbit/s data communication speed from Polish stadiums and 2х140 Gbit/s between Poland and Ukraine. This was required due to the fact that the matches were broadcast in HD quality.[127] The multilateral production utilised 31 cameras to cover the action on and around the pitch at every match, with additional cameras following activities around the game, such as team arrivals at the stadiums, interviews, and media conferences.[128] The official Euro 2012 broadcasting centre was located at the Expo XXI International Centre in Warsaw.[127] The tournament was broadcast live by around 100 TV channels covering the whole world.[129] 150,000,000 people were expected to watch the matches each day.[130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies related to UEFA Euro 2012\n\n![](image)Police in Warsaw before the match between Poland and Russia\nAfter Poland and Ukraine were chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee as host countries for Euro 2012, several issues arose, which jeopardised the Polish/Ukrainian host status.\n\n\nIn Ukraine there were financial difficulties related to stadium and infrastructure renovation related to the economic crisis.[131] In Poland, issues arose related to corruption within the Polish Football Association.[132] In April 2009 however, the president of UEFA, Michel Platini announced that all was on track and that he saw no major problems. After a UEFA delegation visited Ukraine in September 2011, he stated the country was \"virtually ready for Euro 2012\".[133]\n\n\nIn the UK, there were allegations of racism in football in both host countries. The main cause of discussion was the BBC current affairs programme *Panorama*, entitled *Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate*, which included recent footage of supporters chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, plus Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine.[134] The documentary was first echoed in much of the British press, but was then attacked for being one-sided and unethical: critics included other British media outlets; anti-racism campaigners, black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and Gary Lineker, a British football star.[135][136][137][138]\n\n\nIn response to Yulia Tymoshenko's hunger strike and her mistreatment in a Ukrainian prison some European politicians and governments announced that they would boycott the matches in Ukraine.[139][140]\n\n\nUkraine came under criticism from animal welfare organisations for killing stray cats and dogs in order to prepare for Euro 2012.[141] Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and Minister of the Environment promised to take action to prevent killing animals but it still remains unclear how these measures were enforced.[142] The ministry's comments also suggested this would only be a temporary measure, drawing further criticism.[143][144][145]\n\n\nBomb explosions took place in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, on 27 April 2012 and were described as a terrorist attack that may jeopardise the organisation of the tournament in Ukraine.[146]\n\n\nOther important issues were associated with FEMEN's group protests against prostitution and sex tourism in Ukraine, and enormous increases in hotel prices by many hoteliers in the country.[147][148]\n\n\nIn total, four nations were fined by UEFA for racist activities by their fans (none of them were hosts): Germany, Spain, Croatia and Russia.[149]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The match, originally scheduled for 21:45 local time, was delayed 15 minutes to prevent overlap with the other Group D match between Ukraine and France, which had been delayed due to rain.[68]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012\".

The final tournament, held between 8 June and 1 July 2012, was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine (both first time hosts), and was won by Spain, who beat Italy in the final at the Olympic Stadium, Kyiv, Ukraine.[1]\n\n\nPoland and Ukraine's bid was chosen by the UEFA Executive Committee on 18 April 2007.[2] The two host teams qualified automatically while the remaining 14 finalists were decided through a qualifying competition, featuring 51 teams, from August 2010 to November 2011. This was the last European Championship to employ the 16-team finals format in use since 1996; from Euro 2016 onward, it was expanded to 24 finalists.\n\n\nEuro 2012 was played at eight venues, four in each host country. Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and the hosts invested heavily in improving infrastructure such as railways and roads at UEFA's request. Euro 2012 set attendance records for the 16-team format, for the highest aggregate attendance (1,440,896) and average per game (46,481).\n\n\nSpain became the first team to win two consecutive European Championships, and also three straight major tournaments (Euro 2008, 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012).[3] Spain had already gained entry to the 2013 Confederations Cup by winning the World Cup, so runners-up Italy qualified instead. As at Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland, both 2012 host nations were eliminated in the group stage.\n\n\nThere were several players ending on a total of 3 goals but because Fernando Torres made an assist and played the fewest minutes of the players who scored three goals, he was named as the Golden Boot winner for the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 bids\n\nThe hosting of the event was initially contested by five bids representing seven countries: Croatia–Hungary, Greece, Italy, Poland–Ukraine, and Turkey.[4] In November 2005, after an initial consideration of the bid data by UEFA, both the Greek and Turkish bids were eliminated from the process, to leave three candidates.[5]\n\n\nIn May 2006, this was followed by a second round of the selection process, which included visits by UEFA to all candidates.[6] The final decision was due to be announced on 8 December 2006 in Nyon, but this was postponed to \"give bidding associations more time for the fine-tuning of their bids\".[7] On 18 April 2007, the Poland–Ukraine bid was chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee, at a meeting in Cardiff.[2] It was the first time UEFA awarded the tournament organization to the former Eastern Bloc since Yugoslavia in 1976.[8]\n\n\nPoland–Ukraine became the third successful joint bid for the European Championship, after those of Belgium–Netherlands (2000) and Austria–Switzerland (2008). Their bid received an absolute majority of votes, and was therefore announced the winner, without requiring a second round. Italy, which received the remaining votes,[2] had been considered favourites to win the hosting, but incidents of fan violence and a match-fixing scandal were widely cited as factors behind their failure.[9][10][11]\n\n\nThere were some later alterations from the initial bid plan, regarding the venues, before UEFA confirmed the eight host cities in 2009.[12][13] During the preparation process in Poland and Ukraine, UEFA repeatedly expressed concern about their preparation to host the event, with different candidates reported as being alternative hosts if they did not improve;[14][15] however, in the end, UEFA affirmed their selection.[16]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying competition took place in Warsaw on 7 February 2010.[17] Fifty-one teams entered to compete for the fourteen remaining places in the finals, alongside co-hosts Poland and Ukraine. The teams were divided into nine groups, with the draw using the new UEFA national team coefficient for the first time in order to determine the seedings. As defending champions, Spain was automatically top-seeded. The qualifying process began in August 2010 and concluded in November 2011. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in October 2011, the nine group winners qualified automatically, along with the highest ranked second placed team. The remaining eight-second placed teams contested two-legged play-offs, and the four winners qualified for the finals.[18]\n\n\nTwelve of the sixteen finalists participated at the previous tournament in 2008. England and Denmark made their return to the Euro after missing out on 2008, while Republic of Ireland returned after a twenty-four-year absence to make their second appearance at a European Championship. One of the co-hosts, Ukraine, made their debut as an independent nation (before 1992 Ukraine participated as part of the Soviet Union). With the exception of Serbia – according to UEFA's ranking at the end of the qualifying stage – Europe's sixteen highest-ranked teams all qualified for the tournament.\n\n\nRomania and Turkey were the only teams failing to qualify for the final tournament after qualifying to UEFA Euro 2008. (Austria and Switzerland also failed to qualify, but, as hosts of the previous tournament, they didn't took part in the qualifications.)\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time Greece qualified for the European Championship finals, and the last time Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Slovakia, Switzerland, Turkey and Wales failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:[19]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | Co-host | 18 April 2007 | 1 (2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[B] | Group A winner | 2 September 2011 | 10 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group C winner | 6 September 2011 | 7 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group E winner | 6 September 2011 | 8 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group I winner | 6 September 2011 | 8 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004, **2008**)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group G winner | 7 October 2011 | 7 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[C] | Group B winner | 11 October 2011 | 9 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group D winner | 11 October 2011 | 7 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group F winner | 11 October 2011 | 3 (1980, **2004**, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group H winner | 11 October 2011 | 7 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Best runner-up | 11 October 2011 | 4 (*1992*, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 3 (1996, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[D] | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 7 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 5 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Play-off winner | 15 November 2011 | 1 (1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n3. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2011 at the Ukraine Palace of Arts in Kyiv, Ukraine.[20][21] The hour-long ceremony was hosted by Olha Freimut and Piotr Sobczyński, television presenters from the two host countries.\n\n\nAs was the case for the 2000, 2004 and 2008 finals, the sixteen finalists were divided into four seeding pots, using the UEFA national team coefficient ranking.[22] The pot allocations were based on the UEFA national team coefficient rankings of the sixteen finalists at the end of the qualifying competition in November 2011.[23] Each nation's coefficient was generated by calculating:\n\n\n\n* 40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying stage.\n* 40% of the average ranking points per game earned in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage and final tournament.\n* 20% of the average ranking points per game earned in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying stage and final tournament.\n\n\nAside from the coefficient, three teams were automatically placed in Pot 1. Ukraine and Poland were both assigned to Pot 1 as the two host nations, despite the fact that their rankings were the two lowest in the tournament; this also occurred in 2008 when the co-hosts Switzerland and Austria were also ranked below all other qualified teams. As defending champions, Spain were also automatically assigned to Pot 1, though their UEFA ranking at the time of the draw was coincidentally also the best.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, one team from each pot was drawn into each of the four groups. The draw also determined which place in the group teams in pots 2–4 would take (e.g. A2, A3 or A4) to create the match schedule. With Poland automatically assigned in advance to A1, and Ukraine to D1, Pot 1 only had two teams as Spain and the Netherlands were to be drawn into position one in either group B or C.[22][24] The balls were drawn by four former players who had each been part of European Championship winning teams: Horst Hrubesch, Marco van Basten, Peter Schmeichel and Zinedine Zidane.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Spain (holders)[b] | 43,116 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 40,860 | 2\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany | 40,446 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 34,357 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) England | 33,563 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 33,212 | 6\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 33,003 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | 32,455 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 31,717 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 31,675 | 10\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[23] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 31,205 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) France | 30,508 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 29,602 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 28,576 | 14\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Co-hosts Poland (coefficient 23,806; rank 28th) and Ukraine (coefficient 28,029; rank 15th) belonged to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position.

In a return to the format used at Euro 1992, Euro 1996 and Euro 2008, each of the four groups' matches were played in two stadiums. Host cities Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Poznań, Kyiv, and Lviv are all popular tourist destinations, unlike Donetsk and Kharkiv, the latter of which replaced Dnipropetrovsk as a host city in 2009.[26]\n\n\nIn order to meet UEFA's requirement for football infrastructure improvements, five new stadiums were built and opened in advance of the tournament. The remaining three stadiums (in Kyiv, Poznań and Kharkiv) underwent major renovations in order to meet UEFA's infrastructure standards.[27][28] Three of the stadiums are categorised as UEFA's highest category stadiums. The transport infrastructure in Poland and Ukraine was also extensively modified on the request of UEFA to cope with the large influx of football fans.[29]\n\n\nUEFA organised fan zones in the eight host cities. They were located in the centre of each city, with all 31 matches shown live on a total of 24 giant screens. The zones enabled supporters to come together in a secure and controlled environment. The Warsaw Fan Zone occupied 120,000 square meters and accommodated 100,000 visitors. In all, the fans zones had a 20% increase in capacity compared to Euro 2008.[30]\n\n\nA total of 31 matches were played during Euro 2012, with Ukraine hosting 16 of them and Poland 15.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Poland\n |\n| --- |\n| Warsaw | Wrocław | Gdańsk | Poznań |\n| Stadion Narodowy | Stadion Wrocław | PGE Arena | Stadion Miejski |\n| Capacity: **58,580** | Capacity: **45,105** | Capacity: **43,615** | Capacity: **43,269** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Poland\n![UEFA Euro 2012 is located in Poland](image)![Warsaw](image)\nWarsaw\n![Gdańsk](image)\nGdańsk\n![Poznań](image)\nPoznań\n![Wrocław](image)\nWrocław\n | Ukraine\n![UEFA Euro 2012 is located in Ukraine](image)![Kyiv](image)\nKyiv\n![Donetsk](image)\nDonetsk\n![Kharkiv](image)\nKharkiv\n![Lviv](image)\nLviv\n |\n| Ukraine\n |\n| Kyiv | Donetsk | Kharkiv | Lviv |\n| Olympic Stadium | Donbass Arena | Metalist Stadium | Arena Lviv |\n| Capacity: **70,050** | Capacity: **52,187** | Capacity: **40,003** | Capacity: **34,915** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTickets for the venues were sold directly by UEFA via its website, or distributed by the football associations of the 16 finalists. Applications had to be made during March 2011 for the 1.4 million tickets available for the 31 tournament matches.[31] Over 20,000 were forecast to cross the Poland–Ukraine border each day during the tournament.[32] Over 12 million applications were received, which represented a 17% increase on the 2008 finals, and an all-time record for the UEFA European Championship.[33] Owing to this over-subscription for the matches, lotteries were carried out to allocate tickets. Prices varied from €30 (£25) (for a seat behind the goals at a group match) to €600 (£513) (for a seat in the main stand at the final). In addition to individual match tickets, fans could buy packages to see either all matches played by one team, or all matches at one specific venue.[34]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team had a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches. From an initial list of thirty-eight potential locations (twenty-one in Poland, seventeen in Ukraine),[35] the national associations chose their locations in 2011. The teams trained and resided in these locations throughout the tournament, travelling to games staged away from their bases.[36] Thirteen teams stayed in Poland and three in Ukraine.[36]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Croatia\n | Warka |\n| Czech Republic\n | Wrocław |\n| Denmark\n | Kołobrzeg |\n| England\n | Kraków |\n| France\n | Donetsk |\n| Germany\n | Gdańsk |\n| Greece\n | Jachranka |\n| Italy\n | Kraków |\n| Netherlands\n | Kraków |\n| Poland\n | Warsaw |\n| Portugal\n | Opalenica |\n| Republic of Ireland\n | Sopot |\n| Russia\n | Warsaw |\n| Spain\n | Gniewino |\n| Sweden\n | Kyiv |\n| Ukraine\n | Kyiv |\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Tango 12\n\n![](image)Monumental Adidas Tango 12 in Kyiv\nThe Adidas Tango 12 was the official match ball of UEFA Euro 2012.[37] The ball is named after the original Adidas Tango family of footballs; however, the Tango 12 and its variations have a completely new design. Variations of the ball have been used in other contemporary competitions including the Africa Cup of Nations and the Summer Olympics. It is designed to be easier to dribble and control than the reportedly unpredictable Adidas Jabulani used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[38]\n\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he would be replaced by another player.[39]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 December 2011, UEFA named twelve referees and four fourth officials for Euro 2012.[40] On 27 March 2012, UEFA issued the full list of 80 referees to be used in Euro 2012, including the assistant referees, the additional assistant referees, and the four reserve assistant referees.[41] Each refereeing team consisted of five match officials from the same country: one main referee, two assistant referees, and two additional assistant referees. All of the main referees, additional assistant referees, and fourth officials were FIFA referees, and the assistant referees (including the four reserve assistant referees) were FIFA assistant referees.[42][43] For each refereeing team, a third assistant referee from each country was named to remain on standby until the start of the tournament to take the place of a colleague if required.[43] In two cases, for the French and Slovenian refereeing teams, the standby assistant referees took the place of one of the assistant referees before the start of the tournament. Continuing the experiments carried out in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, the two additional assistant referees were used on the goal line for the first time in European Championship history with approval from the International Football Association Board.[40]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country | Referee | Assistant referees | Additional assistant referees | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | Howard Webb | Michael MullarkeyPeter Kirkup[A]Stephen Child (standby) | Martin AtkinsonMark Clattenburg | Russia–Czech Republic (Group A)Italy–Croatia (Group C)Czech Republic–Portugal (Quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Stéphane Lannoy | Frédéric CanoMichaël AnnonierEric Dansault (standby) | Fredy FautrelRuddy Buquet | Germany–Portugal (Group B)Greece–Czech Republic (Group A)Germany–Italy (Semi-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | Wolfgang Stark | Jan-Hendrik SalverMike PickelMark Borsch (standby) | Florian MeyerDeniz Aytekin | Poland–Russia (Group A)Croatia–Spain (Group C)\n |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Viktor Kassai | Gábor ErősGyörgy RingRóbert Kispál (standby) | István VadTamás Bognár | Spain–Italy (Group C)England–Ukraine (Group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Nicola Rizzoli | Renato FaveraniAndrea StefaniLuca Maggiani (standby) | Gianluca RocchiPaolo Tagliavento | France–England (Group D)Portugal–Netherlands (Group B)Spain–France (Quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Björn Kuipers | Sander van Roekel[A]Erwin ZeinstraBerry Simons (standby) | Pol van BoekelRichard Liesveld | Republic of Ireland–Croatia (Group C)Ukraine–France (Group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Pedro Proença | Bertino MirandaRicardo SantosTiago Trigo (standby) | Jorge SousaDuarte Gomes | Spain–Republic of Ireland (Group C)Sweden–France (Group D)England–Italy (Quarter-final)Spain–Italy (Final)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Craig Thomson | Alasdair RossDerek RoseGraham Chambers (standby) | Willie CollumEuan Norris | Denmark–Portugal (Group B)Czech Republic–Poland (Group A)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | Damir Skomina | Primož ArharMatej ŽuničMarko Stančin (standby) | Matej JugSlavko Vinčić | Netherlands–Denmark (Group B)Sweden–England (Group D)Germany–Greece (Quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Carlos Velasco Carballo | Roberto Alonso FernándezJuan Carlos Yuste JiménezJesús Calvo Guadamuro (standby) | David Fernández BorbalánCarlos Clos Gómez | Poland–Greece (Group A)Denmark–Germany (Group B)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Jonas Eriksson | Stefan WittbergMathias KlaseniusFredrik Nilsson (standby) | Markus StrömbergssonStefan Johannesson | Netherlands–Germany (Group B)Greece–Russia (Group A)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Cüneyt Çakır | Bahattin DuranTarık OngunMustafa Emre Eyisoy (standby) | Hüseyin GöçekBülent Yıldırım | Ukraine–Sweden (Group D)Italy–Republic of Ireland (Group C)Portugal–Spain (Semi-final)\n |\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Peter Kirkup was replaced by Dutch assistant Sander van Roekel for the match Czech Republic–Portugal\n\nFour match officials, who served only as fourth officials, and four reserve assistant referees were also named:[40][41]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Country | Fourth official\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Pavel Královec |\n| ![](image) Norway | Tom Harald Hagen |\n| ![](image) Poland | Marcin Borski |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Viktor Shvetsov |\n\n | \n\n| Country | Reserve assistant referee\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Damien MacGraith\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Marcin Borkowski\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Roman Slyško\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | Oleksandr Voytyuk\n |\n\n\n |\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Winner\n Runner-up\n | Semi-finals\n Quarter-finals\n | Group stage\n |\n\nUEFA announced the schedule for the 31 matches of the final tournament in October 2010,[44] with the final confirmation of kick-offs times being affirmed following the tournament draw in December 2011.[45]\n\n\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[39][46]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3, teams still had an equal ranking (e.g. if criteria 1 to 3 were applied to three teams that were level on points initially and these criteria separated one team from the other two who still have an equal ranking), criteria 1 to 3 would be reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams who were still level to determine their final rankings. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 would apply;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. If two teams tie alone (according to 1–5) after having met in the last round of the group stage their ranking is determined by penalty shoot-out.\n8. Position in the UEFA national team coefficient ranking system;\n9. Fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament);\n10. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2012 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- |

Tournament\nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament.[80] The group of eleven analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Ten players from the winning Spanish team were selected in the team of the tournament, while Zlatan Ibrahimović was the only player to be included whose team was knocked out in the group stage.[80][81]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Germany](image) Manuel Neuer![Italy](image) Gianluigi Buffon![Spain](image) Iker Casillas | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm![Portugal](image) Fábio Coentrão![Portugal](image) Pepe![Spain](image) Jordi Alba![Spain](image) Gerard Piqué![Spain](image) Sergio Ramos | ![England](image) Steven Gerrard![Germany](image) Sami Khedira![Germany](image) Mesut Özil![Italy](image) Daniele De Rossi![Italy](image) Andrea Pirlo![Spain](image) Xabi Alonso![Spain](image) Sergio Busquets![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta![Spain](image) Xavi | ![Italy](image) Mario Balotelli![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo![Spain](image) Cesc Fàbregas![Spain](image) David Silva![Sweden](image) Zlatan Ibrahimović |\n\n\n![](image)Fernando Torres (in red) in the final\nGolden Boot\nFernando Torres tied with five other players on goals and with Mario Gómez on goals and assists; however, he played 92 fewer minutes than Gómez did, thus earning the title.

Each team received an initial €8 million and then received additional money, based on their performances.[84] Spain, the winners of Euro 2012, were awarded a total prize of €23 million for their performance.[85] The maximum prize achievable (for winning all group matches and winning the final) was €23.5 million. \n\n\n\n\n\nPrize money\n| Rank (unoff.) | Team | Million €\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image) Spain | 23.0\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Italy | 19.5\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Germany | 16.0\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Portugal | 15.0\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) England | 12.5\n |\n| 6 | ![](image) Czech Republic | 12.0\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) France, ![](image) Greece | 11.5\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Croatia, ![](image) Russia | 10.5\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Denmark, ![](image) Ukraine | 10.0\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Poland, ![](image) Sweden | 9.0\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Netherlands, ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 8.0\n |\n\n\nComplete list:\n\n\n\n* Prize for participating: €8 million\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\n\n\n* Champions: €7.5 million\n* Runner-up: €4.5 million\n* Reaching the semi-finals: €3 million\n* Reaching the quarter-finals: €2 million\n* Finishing in third place in a group: €1 million\n* Winning a group match: €1 million\n* Drawing a group match: €500,000\n\n\nBesides money, commemorative plaques were given to all participants together with special plaques for semi-final losers and finalists.\nGold and silver medals were awarded to the winners and runners-up, respectively, whereas both semi-final losers were awarded bronze medals. The trophy given to the winners remains in the ownership of UEFA; however, the winning nation, Spain, received a full-size replica.[39]\n\n\n\n## Discipline[edit]\n\n\nIn the final tournament, a player was suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches. UEFA's Control and Disciplinary body has the ability to increase the automatic one match ban for a red card (e.g. for violent conduct). Single yellow card cautions were erased at the conclusion of the quarter-finals, and were not carried over to the semi-finals (so that a player could only be suspended for the final by getting a red card in the semi-final). Single yellow cards and suspensions for yellow card accumulations do not carry over to the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament matches.[39] The following players were suspended during the final tournament – for one or more games – as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulations:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Offences\n | Suspensions\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![England](image) Wayne Rooney | ![Red card](image) in qualification v Montenegro | Group D v FranceGroup D v Sweden |\n| ![Greece](image) Sokratis Papastathopoulos | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group A v Poland | Group A v Czech Republic |\n| ![Poland](image) Wojciech Szczęsny | ![Red card](image) in Group A v Greece | Group A v Russia |\n| ![Germany](image) Jérôme Boateng | ![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Portugal![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Netherlands | Group B v Denmark |\n| ![Greece](image) Giorgos Karagounis | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Poland![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia | Quarter-final v Germany |\n| ![Greece](image) José Holebas | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Poland![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia |\n| ![Republic of Ireland](image) Keith Andrews | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group C v Italy | World Cup qualifying v Kazakhstan |\n| ![France](image) Philippe Mexès | ![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Ukraine![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Sweden | Quarter-final v Spain |\n| ![Italy](image) Christian Maggio | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Spain![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v England | Semi-final v Germany |\n\n\nApart from discipline measures for yellow and red cards, UEFA fined the football associations of Croatia,[86][87] England,[88] Germany,[89] Portugal, Russia,[90][91][92] and Spain a total of €417,000 for spectators incidents.[93][94][95] Furthermore, the Portuguese association was fined €5,000 for delaying the start of the second half of the game against Germany.[94] In addition to these, Danish striker Nicklas Bendtner was fined €100,000 and given a one match ban (to be applied in the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament) for revealing his sponsored underpants, violating UEFA regulations, during the celebration of his second goal in the match against Portugal.[96] His fine was later paid by his sponsor.[97]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Trophy tour[edit]\n\n\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy began a journey through the host cities seven weeks before the start of the tournament. A hundred days before the first match a 35.5-metre-high (116 ft) hot air balloon in the shape of the trophy was flown in Nyon, Switzerland and visited 14 cities throughout the host countries, reminding spectators of the impending tournament. On 20 April 2012, the trophy tour started and visited the Polish cities of Warsaw, Wrocław, Gdańsk, Poznań, Kraków, Katowice and Łódź. After the Polish cities, the trophy visited seven Ukrainian cities: Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, and Odesa.[98][99]\n\n\n\n### Logo, slogan and theme songs[edit]\n\n\nThe competition slogan, **Creating History Together** (Polish: *Razem tworzymy przyszłość*, literally, \"Together we are creating the future\", Ukrainian: Творимо історію разом, *Tvorymo istoriyu razom*), was announced along with the logo. The official logo for the tournament was unveiled at a special event at Mykhailivska Square, Kyiv, on 14 December 2009 and was designed by Portuguese group Brandia Central.[100] It took its visual identity from Wycinanki or Vytynanky, a traditional form of paper cutting practised in rural areas of Poland and Ukraine. The art form symbolises the nature of the rural areas of both countries.[101][102] As part of the event, landmark buildings in the eight host cities were illuminated with the tournament logo.[103]\n\n\nThe official Euro 2012 song was \"Endless Summer\" by the German singer Oceana. In addition, UEFA retained the melody that was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on its behalf for the 2008 tournament.[104][105] The Republic of Ireland also produced an official song: \"The Rocky Road to Poland\", recorded by a collaboration of Irish performers, quickly reached number 1 in Ireland and stayed there for three weeks.[106] In Spain, the broadcasting company Mediaset España commissioned the song \"No hay 2 sin 3\", performed by David Bisbal and Cali & El Dandee and produced by RedOne.[107]\n\n\nThe tournament was also associated with the song \"Heart of Courage\" by Two Steps from Hell, which was played in the stadiums during the entrance of the players (before the national anthems);[108][109] and also \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes, in this case after every goal.[110]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise and mascots[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The mascots Slavek & Slavko\nUEFA signed a worldwide licensing agreement with Warner Brothers Consumer Products to help promote the tournament.[111] The agreement involved licensing to third parties for a variety of other merchandising items.\n\n\nAlso designed by Warner Bros. were the official tournament mascots, \"Slavek and Slavko\", twins that wore the national colours of the two host nations. The mascots were unveiled in December 2010,[112] and named following an online poll.[113]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nThe *UEFA Euro 2012 video game* was released by EA Sports as a downloadable expansion pack for *FIFA 12*.[114]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA announced ten global sponsors and, for both Poland and Ukraine, three national sponsors as shown below.[115] These sponsorships together with the broadcasting revenues were estimated to earn UEFA at least US$1.6 billion.[116]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global sponsors | Event sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ukraine\n | Poland\n |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas\n* Canon[117]\n* Castrol\n* Coca-Cola[118]\n* Continental[119]\n* SHARP[120]\n | * Orange[121]\n* Hyundai–Kia[122]\n* Carlsberg[123]\n* McDonald's[124]\n\n\n |\n | * Ukrtelecom\n* Epicenter\n* Ukrsotsbank PJSC[125]\n | * E.

This was required due to the fact that the matches were broadcast in HD quality.[127] The multilateral production utilised 31 cameras to cover the action on and around the pitch at every match, with additional cameras following activities around the game, such as team arrivals at the stadiums, interviews, and media conferences.[128] The official Euro 2012 broadcasting centre was located at the Expo XXI International Centre in Warsaw.[127] The tournament was broadcast live by around 100 TV channels covering the whole world.[129] 150,000,000 people were expected to watch the matches each day.[130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies related to UEFA Euro 2012\n\n![](image)Police in Warsaw before the match between Poland and Russia\nAfter Poland and Ukraine were chosen by a vote of the UEFA Executive Committee as host countries for Euro 2012, several issues arose, which jeopardised the Polish/Ukrainian host status.\n\n\nIn Ukraine there were financial difficulties related to stadium and infrastructure renovation related to the economic crisis.[131] In Poland, issues arose related to corruption within the Polish Football Association.[132] In April 2009 however, the president of UEFA, Michel Platini announced that all was on track and that he saw no major problems. After a UEFA delegation visited Ukraine in September 2011, he stated the country was \"virtually ready for Euro 2012\".[133]\n\n\nIn the UK, there were allegations of racism in football in both host countries. The main cause of discussion was the BBC current affairs programme *Panorama*, entitled *Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate*, which included recent footage of supporters chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of white power symbols and banners in Poland, plus Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine.[134] The documentary was first echoed in much of the British press, but was then attacked for being one-sided and unethical: critics included other British media outlets; anti-racism campaigners, black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and Gary Lineker, a British football star.[135][136][137][138]\n\n\nIn response to Yulia Tymoshenko's hunger strike and her mistreatment in a Ukrainian prison some European politicians and governments announced that they would boycott the matches in Ukraine.[139][140]\n\n\nUkraine came under criticism from animal welfare organisations for killing stray cats and dogs in order to prepare for Euro 2012.[141] Ukrainian Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources and Minister of the Environment promised to take action to prevent killing animals but it still remains unclear how these measures were enforced.[142] The ministry's comments also suggested this would only be a temporary measure, drawing further criticism.[143][144][145]\n\n\nBomb explosions took place in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, on 27 April 2012 and were described as a terrorist attack that may jeopardise the organisation of the tournament in Ukraine.[146]\n\n\nOther important issues were associated with FEMEN's group protests against prostitution and sex tourism in Ukraine, and enormous increases in hotel prices by many hoteliers in the country.[147][148]\n\n\nIn total, four nations were fined by UEFA for racist activities by their fans (none of them were hosts): Germany, Spain, Croatia and Russia.[149]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The match, originally scheduled for 21:45 local time, was delayed 15 minutes to prevent overlap with the other Group D match between Ukraine and France, which had been delayed due to rain.[68]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Spain overpower Italy to win UEFA EURO 2012\".

It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.\n\n\nThe tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France's achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.\n\n\nGreece were the defending champions going into the tournament, having won UEFA Euro 2004. They recorded the worst finish in Euro 2008, losing their three group fixtures and collecting the least prize money. Throughout 31 matches, the participating nations totalled 77 goals, the same as the previous tournament.\n\n\nAustria and Switzerland automatically qualified as hosts; the remaining 14 teams were determined through a qualifying tournament, played between August 2006 and November 2007. As European champions, Spain earned the right to compete in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 bids\n\nAustria and Switzerland jointly bid to host the games, and facing competition from six other bids: Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia, Greece–Turkey, a 4-way Nordic bid (from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Hungary, Russia and Scotland–Republic of Ireland.[1] Austria and Hungary had previously bid together to host Euro 2004, losing out to Portugal, while Sweden had hosted Euro 1992.[1]\n\n\nAustria–Switzerland, Hungary, Greece–Turkey and the Nordic bid were recommended, in that order, before the final vote by UEFA's National Teams Committee.[2]\n\n\nThe final vote by the UEFA executive committee was:[2]\n\n\n\n1. Austria–Switzerland\n2. Hungary\n3. Greece–Turkey\n4. Nordic\n5. Scotland–Ireland\n6. Russia\n7. Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia\n\n\nThe Austria–Switzerland bid became the second successful joint bid in the competition's history, following the UEFA Euro 2000 hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. The following tournament, held in Poland and Ukraine, became the third jointly hosted tournament.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nQualification for Euro 2008 started in August 2006, just over a month after the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The qualifying tournament was contested by national teams from each of UEFA's member associations except Austria and Switzerland, who had automatically qualified for the final tournament as hosts, and Montenegro, who came into existence too late to be admitted to UEFA. England was the only seeded team not to qualify for the tournament proper, whereas Russia was the only unseeded one to qualify. The tournament also marked the debuts of Austria and Poland.\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007, and saw Group C immediately labelled as the \"group of death\", with Italy, France, Romania and the Netherlands competing for the two qualifying places. In contrast, Germany and Portugal were deemed to have an easy draw, as the tournament structure meant they could not meet Italy, France, the Netherlands or Spain until the final.\n\n\nIn the group stage, Croatia, Spain and the Netherlands all qualified with maximum points. Austria and Switzerland were not expected to progress, despite the advantage of being the hosts. In Group A, the Swiss lost their captain, Alexander Frei, to injury in their first game and became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, after losing their first two matches. Switzerland managed to beat the group winner Portugal in their last game.\n\n\nIn Group B, Austria managed to set up a decisive final game against Germany, dubbed \"Austria's final\".[3] However, they lost by one goal, making Euro 2008 the first European Championship not to have one of the host nations present in the knockout phase. In an exciting final game in Group A, an injury- and suspension-hit Turkey came back from 2–0 down to beat the Czech Republic 3–2, after an uncharacteristic handling mistake by Petr Čech, in the last few minutes, left Nihat Kahveci with the simplest of finishes.\n\n\nIn the same game, goalkeeper Volkan Demirel was shown a red card for pushing Czech striker Jan Koller to the ground. The Turks joined Portugal as the qualifiers from Group A. France were the high-profile victims of Group C, recording just one point from a goalless draw against Romania in their opening game. Italy beat the French, on the final day, to finish on four points and join the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Finally, in Group D, Greece failed to reproduce the form of their shock 2004 win, and ended the tournament with no points. Russia qualified at the expense of Sweden, after beating them in a final game decider, joining Spain in the knockout phase.\n\n\nTorrential rain during the Group A match between Switzerland and Turkey on 11 June resulted in the pitch at St. Jakob-Park in Basel requiring to be re-laid. The new pitch was installed in advance of the quarter-final match between Portugal and Germany on 19 June.[4] In the quarter-finals, the Portuguese team was unable to give their coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, a fitting send-off – following the mid-tournament announcement that Scolari would be leaving to join English club Chelsea – losing in an exciting game against Germany. Turkey continued their streak of last-gasp wins, equalising at the end of extra-time against Croatia and advancing on penalties. Coached by Dutchman Guus Hiddink, Russia eliminated the Netherlands with two extra-time goals. The last quarter-final match saw Spain defeat Italy on penalties, after a goalless draw in regular time.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spanish football team touring Madrid as champions\nTurkey's progress was halted by Germany in the semi-finals. Turkey entered the game with nine of their squad members missing due to injury or suspension, but still scored the first goal. Later, they levelled the score at 2–2, before Germany scored the winning goal in the final minute. The world television feed of the match was intermittently lost during the match, which prevented the broadcast of Germany's second goal.\n\n\nThis was due to a thunderstorm at the broadcasting relay station in Austria, despite the game being played in Switzerland. Swiss Television SRG SSR still had a feed, because of their own broadcasting facilities at the venue. During the lost world feed, German and Austrian television ZDF and ORF started to broadcast the feed of German-speaking Swiss channel SF 1.\n\n\nThis act ensured that the German goal was actually broadcast in Germany although not in Turkey.[5] Spain won the second semi-final against Russia by three goals to nil, through second-half goals from Xavi, Daniel Güiza and David Silva, earning Spain their first appearance in a major final for 24 years.\n\n\nIn the final, held at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Spain became European champions for the second time after Fernando Torres' first-half goal proved enough to defeat Germany. Though Germany had a strong start, Spain started to look more dangerous after they had settled.\n\n\nAfter half an hour, Xavi played a pass in behind the Germany back line towards Torres, who outmuscled a hesitant Philipp Lahm and clipped the ball over the diving Jens Lehmann and just inside the far post. That goal proved to be the only goal of the game, which Spain dominated despite Germany having the majority of the possession,[6] and Spain were crowned UEFA Euro 2008 champions.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the qualifying round took place in Montreux, Switzerland on 27 January 2006 at 12:00 CET.\n\n\nThe qualifying process commenced a month after the 2006 World Cup. Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified for the tournament finals as host nations.\n\n\nThe qualifying format was changed compared to previous tournaments. The winners and runners-up from seven groups automatically qualified for the Championship, with the hosts filling the other two slots in the 16-team tournament. The change means there were no play-offs between teams finishing in second place in the groups – they qualified directly for the finals. Teams that finished outside the top two positions in their groups failed to qualify. Group A contained eight teams, and the others contained seven.\n\n\n12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship. Romania and Turkey returned after missing out the 2004 tournament. Notable absentees were England and Ukraine (both 2006 World Cup quarter-finalists) and Denmark, who failed to qualify for the first time since 1980. Bulgaria and Latvia also failed to qualify after playing in Euro 2004.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that England and Ukraine failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Co-host | 12 December 2002 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 2 (1996, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[B] | Group D runner-up | 13 October 2007 | 9 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group C winner | 17 October 2007 | 2 (1980, **2004**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[C] | Group D winner | 17 October 2007 | 6 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group G winner | 17 October 2007 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Group A winner | 17 November 2007 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group B winner | 17 November 2007 | 6 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group B runner-up | 17 November 2007 | 6 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group E winner | 17 November 2007 | 2 (1996, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group F winner | 17 November 2007 | 7 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group G runner-up | 17 November 2007 | 7 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group A runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 4 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Group C runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 2 (1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[D] | Group E runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 8 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group F runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 3 (*1992*, 2000, 2004)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n3. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007 at the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre in Switzerland.[7]\n\n\nAs was the case at the 2000 and 2004 finals, the finalists were divided into four seeding pots, based on the 2007 edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying and Euro 2008 qualifying,[8] with each group having one team drawn from each pot. In a return to the format used at Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team playing all three matches in the same city. Switzerland and Austria, as co-hosts, were automatically assigned to positions A1 and B1, respectively. The remaining 14 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders Greece seeded alongside the Netherlands in Pot 1.[9]\n\n\nUEFA came under heavy criticism from Raymond Domenech, manager of France, who was not satisfied with his team's position in the draw,[10] and was also in favour of having 2006 FIFA World Cup winners Italy as top seed.[11] On 22 November 2007, Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA's professional football director, announced that a review of the coefficient ranking system was under way for future European Championships.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Greece (holders)[b] | 2.167 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 2.417 | 1\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 2.409 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2.364 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 2.333 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2.273 | 5\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Romania | 2.250 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2.250 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 2.192 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 2.182 | 9\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | 2.167 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2.091 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 1.958 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 1.958 | 15\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Co-hosts Switzerland (coefficient 1.800; rank 20th) and Austria (coefficient 1.500; rank 27th) belonged to pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position. Ahead of the draw, they were removed from pot 1 and automatically assigned to group positions A1 and B1, respectively.\n2. **^** Defending champions Greece (coefficient 2.167; rank 11th) were automatically assigned to Pot 1, and could be drawn into either Group C or D.\n\nAll teams from each pot, were drawn consecutively into Group A to D. From Pot 1, the remaining two teams for Group C and Group D were first drawn. All Pot 1 teams automatically occupy the first positions of their groups. Next step was to draw all teams in the order from Pot 4, Pot 3 and Pot 2; and for these teams the next group positions 2/3/4 were drawn separately from an extra glass bowl, for the purposes of determining the match schedules in each group. Coincidentally, all teams from Pots 2, 3, and 4 drew the exact same group position number as their pot number.[12][13]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12][13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| A2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| A3 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| A4 | ![](image) Turkey |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Austria |\n| B2 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| B3 | ![](image) Germany |\n| B4 | ![](image) Poland |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| C2 | ![](image) Italy |\n| C3 | ![](image) Romania |\n| C4 | ![](image) France |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Greece |\n| D2 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| D3 | ![](image) Spain |\n| D4 | ![](image) Russia |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament was played at eight venues throughout the two host nations; four in Austria and four in Switzerland. Each venue had a capacity of at least 30,000 for the tournament; the largest stadium was Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna with a capacity of 53,295.[15] It was for this reason that Ernst-Happel-Stadion hosted the final. Switzerland played all three group stage matches at St. Jakob Park in Basel, which also hosted the opening match of the tournament as a compromise for the final being held in Vienna. Austria played all of their group stage matches at Ernst-Happel-Stadion.\n\n\nIn 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead;[16] UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Austria\n | Switzerland\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vienna | Klagenfurt | Basel | Bern |\n| Ernst-Happel-Stadion | Wörthersee Stadion | St. Jakob-Park | Stade de Suisse |\n| Capacity: **53,295** | Capacity: **31,957** | Capacity: **42,500** | Capacity: **31,907** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 2008 is located in Austria](image)![Vienna](image)\nVienna\n![Klagenfurt](image)\nKlagenfurt\n![Innsbruck](image)\nInnsbruck\n![Salzburg](image)\nSalzburg\n | ![UEFA Euro 2008 is located in Switzerland](image)![Basel](image)\nBasel\n![Bern](image)\nBern\n![Geneva](image)\nGeneva\n![Zürich](image)\nZürich\n |\n| Innsbruck | Salzburg | Geneva | Zürich |\n| Tivoli-Neu | Stadion Wals-Siezenheim | Stade de Genève | Letzigrund |\n| Capacity: **31,600** | Capacity: **31,895** | Capacity: **31,228** | Capacity: **30,930** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team had access to a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches.[17] The teams trained and resided in these locations during the tournament, and travelled to games that took place away from their bases.[18][19] The 16 teams validated their option with UEFA on 18 December 2007.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Austria\n | Stegersbach |\n| Croatia\n | Bad Tatzmannsdorf |\n| Czech Republic\n | Seefeld in Tirol |\n| France\n | Mont Pèlerin |\n| Germany\n | Ascona |\n| Greece\n | Hof bei Salzburg |\n| Italy\n | Baden bei Wien |\n| Netherlands\n | Lausanne |\n| Poland\n | Bad Waltersdorf |\n| Portugal\n | Neuchâtel |\n| Romania\n | St. Gallen |\n| Russia\n | Leogang |\n| Spain\n | Neustift im Stubaital |\n| Sweden\n | Lugano |\n| Switzerland\n | Feusisberg |\n| Turkey\n | Bellevue |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 squads\n\nTeams were required to select a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, with the final squad to be submitted to UEFA by 28 May 2008. If a member of the final squad suffered an injury prior to his team's first game that would keep him out of the entire tournament, another player could be called up to replace him.[20]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 December 2007, UEFA announced twelve referees and twenty-four assistants were selected for the tournament.[21] In April 2008, after failing a physical fitness test, Norwegian assistant referee Erik Ræstad was replaced by fellow countryman Jan Petter Randen.[22] Italian referee Roberto Rosetti was selected to officiate both the opening match between Switzerland and the Czech Republic and the final between Germany and Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistants\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Konrad Plautz | Egon BereuterMarkus Mayr\n | Spain 4–1 Russia, Switzerland 2–0 Portugal |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Frank De Bleeckere | Peter HermansAlex Verstraeten\n | Croatia 2–1 Germany, Russia 2–0 Sweden, Russia 0–3 Spain (semifinal) |\n| ![](image) England | Howard Webb | Darren CannMike Mullarkey\n | Austria 1–1 Poland, Greece 1–2 Spain |\n| ![](image) Germany | Herbert Fandel | Carsten KadachVolker Wezel\n | Portugal 2–0 Turkey, Netherlands 4–1 France, Spain 0–0 Italy (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Greece | Kyros Vassaras | Dimitrios BozatzidisDimitrios Saraidaris\n | Czech Republic 1–3 Portugal, Poland 0–1 Croatia |\n| ![](image) Italy | Roberto Rosetti | Alessandro GriselliPaolo Calcagno\n | Switzerland 0–1 Czech Republic, Greece 0–1 Russia, Croatia 1–1 Turkey (Quarter-final), Germany 0–1 Spain (Final) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Pieter Vink | Adriaan IniaHans ten Hoove\n | Austria 0–1 Croatia, Sweden 1–2 Spain |\n| ![](image) Norway | Tom Henning Øvrebø | Geir Åge Holen~~Erik Ræstad~~Jan Petter Randen\n | Germany 2–0 Poland, Italy 1–1 Romania |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Ľuboš Micheľ | Roman SlyškoMartin Balko\n | Switzerland 1–2 Turkey, France 0–2 Italy, Netherlands 1–3 Russia (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Manuel Mejuto González | Juan Carlos Yuste JiménezJesús Calvo Guadamuro\n | Romania 0–0 France, Austria 0–1 Germany |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Peter Fröjdfeldt | Stefan WittbergHenrik Andrén\n | Netherlands 3–0 Italy, Turkey 3–2 Czech Republic, Portugal 2–3 Germany (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Massimo Busacca | Matthias ArnetStéphane Cuhat\n | Greece 0–2 Sweden, Netherlands 2–0 Romania, Germany 3–2 Turkey (Semi-final) |\n\n\n**Fourth officials**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Ivan Bebek |\n| ![](image) France | Stéphane Lannoy |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Viktor Kassai |\n| ![](image) Iceland | Kristinn Jakobsson |\n| ![](image) Poland | Grzegorz Gilewski |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Olegário Benquerença |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Craig Thomson |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | Damir Skomina |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Performance of the participating countries during Euro 2008\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nFor the three-game group stage of this tournament, where two or more teams in a group tied on an equal number of points, the finishing positions were determined by the following tie-breaking criteria in the following order:[20]\n\n\n\n1. number of points obtained in the matches among the teams in question\n2. goal difference in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)\n3. number of goals scored in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)\n4. goal difference in all the group matches\n5. number of goals scored in all the group matches\n6. coefficient from the qualifying competitions for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2006/08 UEFA European Football Championship (points obtained divided by the number of matches played)\n7. fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament)\n8. drawing of lots\n\n\nHowever, these criteria would not apply if two teams tied on points and goals scored played against each other in their final group match and no other team in group finishes with same points; in that case, the tie would be broken by a penalty shootout.[20]\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Portugal | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 3\n | +2\n | 6[a] | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Turkey | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 6[a] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Czech Republic | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | −2\n | 3[b] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)  Switzerland (H) | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 3[b] |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Head-to-head result: Portugal 2–0 Turkey.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Head-to-head result: Switzerland 0–1 Czech Republic.\n\n7 June 2008 (2008-06-07)\n18:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Svěrkoš ![](image) 71'\n |\n\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[23]\nReferee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)\n\n7 June 2008 (2008-06-07)\n20:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Pepe ![](image) 61'\n* Meireles ![](image) 90+3'\n | Report |  |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,106[24]\nReferee: Herbert Fandel (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n11 June 2008 (2008-06-11)\n18:00\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 1–3 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Sionko ![](image) 17'\n | Report | * Deco ![](image) 8'\n* Ronaldo ![](image) 63'\n* Quaresma ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,016[25]\nReferee: Kyros Vassaras (Greece)\n\n11 June 2008 (2008-06-11)\n20:45\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 1–2 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Yakin ![](image) 32'\n | Report | * Semih ![](image) 57'\n* Turan ![](image) 90+2'\n |\n\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[26]\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2008 (2008-06-15)\n20:45\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Yakin ![](image) 71', 83' (pen.)\n | Report |  |\n\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[27]\nReferee: Konrad Plautz (Austria)\n\n15 June 2008 (2008-06-15)\n20:45\n\n\n| Turkey ![](image) | 3–2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Turan ![](image) 75'\n* Nihat ![](image) 87', 89'\n | Report | * Koller ![](image) 34'\n* Plašil ![](image) 62'\n |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,016[28]\nReferee: Peter Fröjdfeldt (Sweden)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 Group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Croatia | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Germany | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 2\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Austria (H) | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | −2\n | 1[a] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Poland | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | −3\n | 1[a] |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Austria 1–1 Poland).

tournaments. Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout phase of the tournament.[47]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST

Player of the Tournament.\n#### UEFA Team of the Tournament[edit]\n\n\nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of nine analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Nine players from the winning Spanish team were named in the team of the tournament, while no players knocked out in the group stage were included. Four players from semi-finalists Russia were also included, the first-time ever there were Russian players in the Team of the Tournament following the fall of the Soviet Union.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Italy](image) Gianluigi Buffon![Netherlands](image) Edwin van der Sar![Spain](image) Iker Casillas | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm![Portugal](image) José Bosingwa![Portugal](image) Pepe![Russia](image) Yuri Zhirkov![Spain](image) Carlos Marchena![Spain](image) Carles Puyol | ![Croatia](image) Luka Modrić![Germany](image) Michael Ballack![Germany](image) Lukas Podolski![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder![Russia](image) Konstantin Zyryanov![Spain](image) Cesc Fàbregas![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta![Spain](image) Marcos Senna![Spain](image) Xavi![Turkey](image) Hamit Altıntop | ![Russia](image) Andrey Arshavin![Russia](image) Roman Pavlyuchenko![Spain](image) Fernando Torres![Spain](image) David Villa |\n\n\n#### UEFA Player of the Tournament[edit]\n\n\nThe UEFA Technical Team also had to pick a Player of the Tournament, taking fans' votes into account. The player chosen was Spain midfielder Xavi.[55]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Xavi\n\n\n#### Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Boot was awarded to yet another Spaniard, David Villa, who scored four goals, three of which came in his side's 4–1 win over Russia (the only hat-trick scored in the tournament).[56]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) David Villa (4 goals)\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nUEFA announced that total of €184 million has been offered to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, increasing from €129 million in the previous tournament. The distributions as below:[57]\n\n\n\n* Prize for participating: €7.5 million\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\n\n\n* Winner: €7.5 million\n* Runner-up: €4.5 million\n* Semi-finals: €3 million\n* Quarter-finals: €2 million\n* Group stage (per match):\n\t+ Win: €1 million\n\t+ Draw: €500,000\n\n\nSpain, as winners of the tournament and winners of all three of their group stage matches, received a total prize of €23 million, the maximum possible prize money. Greece on the other hand, being the only team to lose all three of their group matches, were the only team to receive nothing more than the €7.5 million participation prize.\n\n\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, players may be suspended from playing in subsequent matches upon the collection of a certain number of yellow or red cards. If a player is shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – that player is suspended from playing in his team's next match. If his team is eliminated from the competition before the end of his suspension, the games carry over to the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. A player is also suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated are annulled once a team is eliminated from the tournament or reaches the semi-finals.[58]\n\n\nIn extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA may choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension is required. One case of this at Euro 2008 was the suspension of Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel for two matches for pushing Czech striker Jan Koller.[59]\n\n\nThe following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Offence(s)\n | Suspension(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Russia](image) Andrey Arshavin | ![Red card](image) in Euro qualifying v Andorra | Group D v SpainGroup D v Greece |\n| ![Germany](image) Bastian Schweinsteiger | ![Red card](image) in Group B v Croatia | Group B v Austria |\n| ![Austria](image) Sebastian Prödl | ![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Croatia![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Poland | Group B v Germany |\n| ![Romania](image) Dorin Goian | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v France![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Italy | Group C v Netherlands |\n| ![Turkey](image) Mehmet Aurélio | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Switzerland![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic | Quarter-final v Croatia |\n| ![Turkey](image) Volkan Demirel | ![Red card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic | Quarter-final v CroatiaSemi-final v Germany |\n| ![France](image) Eric Abidal | ![Red card](image) in Group C v Italy | World Cup qualifying v Austria |\n| ![Italy](image) Andrea Pirlo | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Romania![Yellow card](image) in Group C v France | Quarter-final v Spain |\n| ![Italy](image) Gennaro Gattuso | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Netherlands![Yellow card](image) in Group C v France | Quarter-final v Spain |\n| ![Turkey](image) Tuncay Şanlı | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Switzerland![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Croatia | Semi-final v Germany |\n| ![Turkey](image) Arda Turan | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Croatia | Semi-final v Germany |\n| ![Turkey](image) Emre Aşık | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Croatia | Semi-final v Germany |\n| ![Russia](image) Denis Kolodin | ![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Sweden![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Netherlands | Semi-final v Spain |\n| ![Russia](image) Dmitri Torbinski | ![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Greece![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Netherlands | Semi-final v Spain |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Television coverage failure[edit]\n\n\nThree times in the second half of the semi-final between Germany and Turkey, nearly the entire global television coverage of the game was interrupted. A thunderstorm over Vienna caused technical difficulties in the International Broadcast Centre (IBC), which relayed the television feed from the match in Basel, Switzerland, resulting in one or more goals being missed by various audiences.[60] Various national broadcasters took emergency contingency measures such as reverting to radio broadcasting (for example, the BBC used coverage from Radio 5 Live,[61] Ireland circumvented the problem by having RTÉ Two's studio presenter Bill O'Herlihy and panellists Eamon Dunphy, Johnny Giles and Liam Brady provide emergency discussion on what had happened in the match,[62] and Øyvind Alsaker, commentator from Norwegian TV2 picked up his mobile and filmed it over a 3G connection). Only the Swiss public broadcaster SRG maintained full coverage since it used a direct signal other than the IBC's.[63]\n\n\n\n### New trophy[edit]\n\n\nA new trophy was awarded to the winners of the Euro 2008 tournament. The new version of the Henri Delaunay Trophy, created by Asprey London,[64] is almost an exact replica of the original designed by Arthus-Bertrand. A small figure juggling a ball on the back of the original has been removed, as has the marble plinth. The silver base of the trophy also had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have now been engraved on the back of the trophy, which is made of sterling silver, weighs 8 kilograms (17.6 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall.\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large model of the *adidas Europass* prior to the final between Germany and Spain\nThe match ball for the finals was unveiled at the draw ceremony. Produced by Adidas and named the *Europass*, it is a 14-panel ball in the same construction as the Teamgeist, but with a modified surface design.[65] A version named the *Europass Gloria* was used in the final.[66]\n\n\nThere were concerns raised about the match ball, which was claimed to deviate unpredictably in flight, making it difficult to judge for goalkeepers. Notable players to criticise were Germany's Jens Lehmann and the Czech Republic's Petr Čech.[67] These claims were disputed by the ball's designer, Oliver Kahn.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe official melody was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on behalf of UEFA.[68] The official Euro 2008 song was \"Can You Hear Me\" by Enrique Iglesias, which was performed live during the official closing ceremony prior to the final in Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna on 29 June.[69]\n\n\nTwo soundtracks, \"Like a Superstar\" and \"Feel the Rush,\" were recorded by Jamaican reggae artist Shaggy as mascot songs for Euro 2008. They formed a musical background to video clips featuring the twin mascots Trix and Flix.[68]\n\n\nThe official Swiss song for the tournament was a new version of \"Bring en hei\" (*Bring him Home*) by Baschi.[69] Christina Stürmer sang the official tournament song of Austrian ÖFB, \"Fieber\" (*Fever*).[70] Croatia manager Slaven Bilić recorded his country's official Euro 2008 song, \"Vatreno ludilo\" (\"Fiery Madness\"), with his rock group, Rawbau.\n\n\n\"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes was played when players walked out before kick-off,[71] and a remix of \"Samba de Janeiro\" by German dance group Bellini was played after each goal scored in the competition.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship mascot\n\nThe two official mascots for UEFA Euro 2008, were named after a vote from the public of the two host nations from the following options:\n\n\n\n* Zigi and Zagi\n* Flitz and Bitz\n* Trix and Flix\n\n\nIn April 2007, after receiving 36.3% of the vote, Trix and Flix were chosen. \"I am sure the mascots and their names will become a vital part of the understanding of the whole event,\" said Christian Mutschler, the tournament director for Switzerland.[74] The mascots were unveiled on 27 September 2006, in Vienna, Austria. Their official début was on 11 October 2006, at the Austria vs. Switzerland friendly, which ended 2–1.[75]\n\n\n\n### Slogan[edit]\n\n\nThe slogan for UEFA Euro 2008 was chosen on 24 January 2007: *Expect Emotions*.[76] UEFA President Michel Platini stated, \"It describes in a nutshell what the UEFA Euro 2008 has to offer: all kinds of emotions – joy, disappointment, relief or high tension – right up to the final whistle.\"[77]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n**Global Sponsors:**\n\n\n\n* Adidas\n* Canon Inc[78]\n* Carlsberg Group\n* Castrol[79]\n* Coca-Cola\n* Continental\n* Hyundai Motor Group/Kia Corporation\n* JVC\n* MasterCard\n* McDonald's\n\n\n**National Supporters (Switzerland):**\n\n\n\n* UBS[80]\n* Swisscom[81]\n* Ferrero Switzerland (Kinder Chocolate, Nutella, Ferrero Rocher)[82]\n\n\n**National Supporters (Austria):**\n\n\n\n* Telekom austria[83]\n* Österreichische Post\n* UniCredit\n\n\nHublot were the official watch and timekeeper of the tournament,[84] while Intersport became the official retail licensee.[85]\n\n\nBenQ were initially announced as one of the global sponsors of the tournament,[86] shortly after its mobile phone branch in Germany filed for insolvency.[87] The deal was later cancelled.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 broadcasting rights\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Euro 2008 contenders\". *BBC Sport*. 9 December 2002.

It took place in Austria and Switzerland (both hosting the tournament for the first time) from 7 to 29 June 2008.\n\n\nThe tournament was won by Spain, who defeated Germany 1–0 in the final. Spain were only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and then the European Championship itself, matching France's achievement from 1984. Spain were also the first team since Germany in 1996 to win the tournament undefeated.\n\n\nGreece were the defending champions going into the tournament, having won UEFA Euro 2004. They recorded the worst finish in Euro 2008, losing their three group fixtures and collecting the least prize money. Throughout 31 matches, the participating nations totalled 77 goals, the same as the previous tournament.\n\n\nAustria and Switzerland automatically qualified as hosts; the remaining 14 teams were determined through a qualifying tournament, played between August 2006 and November 2007. As European champions, Spain earned the right to compete in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 bids\n\nAustria and Switzerland jointly bid to host the games, and facing competition from six other bids: Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia, Greece–Turkey, a 4-way Nordic bid (from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), Hungary, Russia and Scotland–Republic of Ireland.[1] Austria and Hungary had previously bid together to host Euro 2004, losing out to Portugal, while Sweden had hosted Euro 1992.[1]\n\n\nAustria–Switzerland, Hungary, Greece–Turkey and the Nordic bid were recommended, in that order, before the final vote by UEFA's National Teams Committee.[2]\n\n\nThe final vote by the UEFA executive committee was:[2]\n\n\n\n1. Austria–Switzerland\n2. Hungary\n3. Greece–Turkey\n4. Nordic\n5. Scotland–Ireland\n6. Russia\n7. Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia\n\n\nThe Austria–Switzerland bid became the second successful joint bid in the competition's history, following the UEFA Euro 2000 hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. The following tournament, held in Poland and Ukraine, became the third jointly hosted tournament.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nQualification for Euro 2008 started in August 2006, just over a month after the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The qualifying tournament was contested by national teams from each of UEFA's member associations except Austria and Switzerland, who had automatically qualified for the final tournament as hosts, and Montenegro, who came into existence too late to be admitted to UEFA. England was the only seeded team not to qualify for the tournament proper, whereas Russia was the only unseeded one to qualify. The tournament also marked the debuts of Austria and Poland.\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007, and saw Group C immediately labelled as the \"group of death\", with Italy, France, Romania and the Netherlands competing for the two qualifying places. In contrast, Germany and Portugal were deemed to have an easy draw, as the tournament structure meant they could not meet Italy, France, the Netherlands or Spain until the final.\n\n\nIn the group stage, Croatia, Spain and the Netherlands all qualified with maximum points. Austria and Switzerland were not expected to progress, despite the advantage of being the hosts. In Group A, the Swiss lost their captain, Alexander Frei, to injury in their first game and became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, after losing their first two matches. Switzerland managed to beat the group winner Portugal in their last game.\n\n\nIn Group B, Austria managed to set up a decisive final game against Germany, dubbed \"Austria's final\".[3] However, they lost by one goal, making Euro 2008 the first European Championship not to have one of the host nations present in the knockout phase. In an exciting final game in Group A, an injury- and suspension-hit Turkey came back from 2–0 down to beat the Czech Republic 3–2, after an uncharacteristic handling mistake by Petr Čech, in the last few minutes, left Nihat Kahveci with the simplest of finishes.\n\n\nIn the same game, goalkeeper Volkan Demirel was shown a red card for pushing Czech striker Jan Koller to the ground. The Turks joined Portugal as the qualifiers from Group A. France were the high-profile victims of Group C, recording just one point from a goalless draw against Romania in their opening game. Italy beat the French, on the final day, to finish on four points and join the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Finally, in Group D, Greece failed to reproduce the form of their shock 2004 win, and ended the tournament with no points. Russia qualified at the expense of Sweden, after beating them in a final game decider, joining Spain in the knockout phase.\n\n\nTorrential rain during the Group A match between Switzerland and Turkey on 11 June resulted in the pitch at St. Jakob-Park in Basel requiring to be re-laid. The new pitch was installed in advance of the quarter-final match between Portugal and Germany on 19 June.[4] In the quarter-finals, the Portuguese team was unable to give their coach, Luiz Felipe Scolari, a fitting send-off – following the mid-tournament announcement that Scolari would be leaving to join English club Chelsea – losing in an exciting game against Germany. Turkey continued their streak of last-gasp wins, equalising at the end of extra-time against Croatia and advancing on penalties. Coached by Dutchman Guus Hiddink, Russia eliminated the Netherlands with two extra-time goals. The last quarter-final match saw Spain defeat Italy on penalties, after a goalless draw in regular time.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spanish football team touring Madrid as champions\nTurkey's progress was halted by Germany in the semi-finals. Turkey entered the game with nine of their squad members missing due to injury or suspension, but still scored the first goal. Later, they levelled the score at 2–2, before Germany scored the winning goal in the final minute. The world television feed of the match was intermittently lost during the match, which prevented the broadcast of Germany's second goal.\n\n\nThis was due to a thunderstorm at the broadcasting relay station in Austria, despite the game being played in Switzerland. Swiss Television SRG SSR still had a feed, because of their own broadcasting facilities at the venue. During the lost world feed, German and Austrian television ZDF and ORF started to broadcast the feed of German-speaking Swiss channel SF 1.\n\n\nThis act ensured that the German goal was actually broadcast in Germany although not in Turkey.[5] Spain won the second semi-final against Russia by three goals to nil, through second-half goals from Xavi, Daniel Güiza and David Silva, earning Spain their first appearance in a major final for 24 years.\n\n\nIn the final, held at Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Spain became European champions for the second time after Fernando Torres' first-half goal proved enough to defeat Germany. Though Germany had a strong start, Spain started to look more dangerous after they had settled.\n\n\nAfter half an hour, Xavi played a pass in behind the Germany back line towards Torres, who outmuscled a hesitant Philipp Lahm and clipped the ball over the diving Jens Lehmann and just inside the far post. That goal proved to be the only goal of the game, which Spain dominated despite Germany having the majority of the possession,[6] and Spain were crowned UEFA Euro 2008 champions.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the qualifying round took place in Montreux, Switzerland on 27 January 2006 at 12:00 CET.\n\n\nThe qualifying process commenced a month after the 2006 World Cup. Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified for the tournament finals as host nations.\n\n\nThe qualifying format was changed compared to previous tournaments. The winners and runners-up from seven groups automatically qualified for the Championship, with the hosts filling the other two slots in the 16-team tournament. The change means there were no play-offs between teams finishing in second place in the groups – they qualified directly for the finals. Teams that finished outside the top two positions in their groups failed to qualify. Group A contained eight teams, and the others contained seven.\n\n\n12 out of 16 teams who qualified for previous tournament also qualified, but the hosts, Austria, and Poland made their debuts at the European Championship. Romania and Turkey returned after missing out the 2004 tournament. Notable absentees were England and Ukraine (both 2006 World Cup quarter-finalists) and Denmark, who failed to qualify for the first time since 1980. Bulgaria and Latvia also failed to qualify after playing in Euro 2004.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that England and Ukraine failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Co-host | 12 December 2002 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 2 (1996, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[B] | Group D runner-up | 13 October 2007 | 9 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group C winner | 17 October 2007 | 2 (1980, **2004**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[C] | Group D winner | 17 October 2007 | 6 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group G winner | 17 October 2007 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | Group A winner | 17 November 2007 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group B winner | 17 November 2007 | 6 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group B runner-up | 17 November 2007 | 6 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group E winner | 17 November 2007 | 2 (1996, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group F winner | 17 November 2007 | 7 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group G runner-up | 17 November 2007 | 7 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group A runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 4 (1984, 1996, 2000, *2004*)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Group C runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 2 (1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[D] | Group E runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 8 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2004)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group F runner-up | 21 November 2007 | 3 (*1992*, 2000, 2004)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n3. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007 at the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre in Switzerland.[7]\n\n\nAs was the case at the 2000 and 2004 finals, the finalists were divided into four seeding pots, based on the 2007 edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying and Euro 2008 qualifying,[8] with each group having one team drawn from each pot. In a return to the format used at Euro 1992 and Euro 1996 the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team playing all three matches in the same city. Switzerland and Austria, as co-hosts, were automatically assigned to positions A1 and B1, respectively. The remaining 14 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders Greece seeded alongside the Netherlands in Pot 1.[9]\n\n\nUEFA came under heavy criticism from Raymond Domenech, manager of France, who was not satisfied with his team's position in the draw,[10] and was also in favour of having 2006 FIFA World Cup winners Italy as top seed.[11] On 22 November 2007, Giorgio Marchetti, UEFA's professional football director, announced that a review of the coefficient ranking system was under way for future European Championships.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Greece (holders)[b] | 2.167 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 2.417 | 1\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 2.409 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2.364 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 2.333 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2.273 | 5\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Romania | 2.250 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2.250 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 2.192 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 2.182 | 9\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[8] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | 2.167 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2.091 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 1.958 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 1.958 | 15\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Co-hosts Switzerland (coefficient 1.800; rank 20th) and Austria (coefficient 1.500; rank 27th) belonged to pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position. Ahead of the draw, they were removed from pot 1 and automatically assigned to group positions A1 and B1, respectively.\n2. **^** Defending champions Greece (coefficient 2.167; rank 11th) were automatically assigned to Pot 1, and could be drawn into either Group C or D.\n\nAll teams from each pot, were drawn consecutively into Group A to D. From Pot 1, the remaining two teams for Group C and Group D were first drawn. All Pot 1 teams automatically occupy the first positions of their groups. Next step was to draw all teams in the order from Pot 4, Pot 3 and Pot 2; and for these teams the next group positions 2/3/4 were drawn separately from an extra glass bowl, for the purposes of determining the match schedules in each group. Coincidentally, all teams from Pots 2, 3, and 4 drew the exact same group position number as their pot number.[12][13]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12][13][14]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| A2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| A3 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| A4 | ![](image) Turkey |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Austria |\n| B2 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| B3 | ![](image) Germany |\n| B4 | ![](image) Poland |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| C2 | ![](image) Italy |\n| C3 | ![](image) Romania |\n| C4 | ![](image) France |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Greece |\n| D2 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| D3 | ![](image) Spain |\n| D4 | ![](image) Russia |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nThe tournament was played at eight venues throughout the two host nations; four in Austria and four in Switzerland. Each venue had a capacity of at least 30,000 for the tournament; the largest stadium was Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna with a capacity of 53,295.[15] It was for this reason that Ernst-Happel-Stadion hosted the final. Switzerland played all three group stage matches at St. Jakob Park in Basel, which also hosted the opening match of the tournament as a compromise for the final being held in Vienna. Austria played all of their group stage matches at Ernst-Happel-Stadion.\n\n\nIn 2004, the Zürich venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the Hardturm stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organisers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organisers proposed renovating Letzigrund instead;[16] UEFA approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Austria\n | Switzerland\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vienna | Klagenfurt | Basel | Bern |\n| Ernst-Happel-Stadion | Wörthersee Stadion | St. Jakob-Park | Stade de Suisse |\n| Capacity: **53,295** | Capacity: **31,957** | Capacity: **42,500** | Capacity: **31,907** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 2008 is located in Austria](image)![Vienna](image)\nVienna\n![Klagenfurt](image)\nKlagenfurt\n![Innsbruck](image)\nInnsbruck\n![Salzburg](image)\nSalzburg\n | ![UEFA Euro 2008 is located in Switzerland](image)![Basel](image)\nBasel\n![Bern](image)\nBern\n![Geneva](image)\nGeneva\n![Zürich](image)\nZürich\n |\n| Innsbruck | Salzburg | Geneva | Zürich |\n| Tivoli-Neu | Stadion Wals-Siezenheim | Stade de Genève | Letzigrund |\n| Capacity: **31,600** | Capacity: **31,895** | Capacity: **31,228** | Capacity: **30,930** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team had access to a \"team base camp\" for its stay between the matches.[17] The teams trained and resided in these locations during the tournament, and travelled to games that took place away from their bases.[18][19] The 16 teams validated their option with UEFA on 18 December 2007.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Austria\n | Stegersbach |\n| Croatia\n | Bad Tatzmannsdorf |\n| Czech Republic\n | Seefeld in Tirol |\n| France\n | Mont Pèlerin |\n| Germany\n | Ascona |\n| Greece\n | Hof bei Salzburg |\n| Italy\n | Baden bei Wien |\n| Netherlands\n | Lausanne |\n| Poland\n | Bad Waltersdorf |\n| Portugal\n | Neuchâtel |\n| Romania\n | St. Gallen |\n| Russia\n | Leogang |\n| Spain\n | Neustift im Stubaital |\n| Sweden\n | Lugano |\n| Switzerland\n | Feusisberg |\n| Turkey\n | Bellevue |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 squads\n\nTeams were required to select a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, with the final squad to be submitted to UEFA by 28 May 2008. If a member of the final squad suffered an injury prior to his team's first game that would keep him out of the entire tournament, another player could be called up to replace him.[20]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 December 2007, UEFA announced twelve referees and twenty-four assistants were selected for the tournament.[21] In April 2008, after failing a physical fitness test, Norwegian assistant referee Erik Ræstad was replaced by fellow countryman Jan Petter Randen.[22] Italian referee Roberto Rosetti was selected to officiate both the opening match between Switzerland and the Czech Republic and the final between Germany and Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistants\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Konrad Plautz | Egon BereuterMarkus Mayr\n | Spain 4–1 Russia, Switzerland 2–0 Portugal |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Frank De Bleeckere | Peter HermansAlex Verstraeten\n | Croatia 2–1 Germany, Russia 2–0 Sweden, Russia 0–3 Spain (semifinal) |\n| ![](image) England | Howard Webb | Darren CannMike Mullarkey\n | Austria 1–1 Poland, Greece 1–2 Spain |\n| ![](image) Germany | Herbert Fandel | Carsten KadachVolker Wezel\n | Portugal 2–0 Turkey, Netherlands 4–1 France, Spain 0–0 Italy (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Greece | Kyros Vassaras | Dimitrios BozatzidisDimitrios Saraidaris\n | Czech Republic 1–3 Portugal, Poland 0–1 Croatia |\n| ![](image) Italy | Roberto Rosetti | Alessandro GriselliPaolo Calcagno\n | Switzerland 0–1 Czech Republic, Greece 0–1 Russia, Croatia 1–1 Turkey (Quarter-final), Germany 0–1 Spain (Final) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Pieter Vink | Adriaan IniaHans ten Hoove\n | Austria 0–1 Croatia, Sweden 1–2 Spain |\n| ![](image) Norway | Tom Henning Øvrebø | Geir Åge Holen~~Erik Ræstad~~Jan Petter Randen\n | Germany 2–0 Poland, Italy 1–1 Romania |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Ľuboš Micheľ | Roman SlyškoMartin Balko\n | Switzerland 1–2 Turkey, France 0–2 Italy, Netherlands 1–3 Russia (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Manuel Mejuto González | Juan Carlos Yuste JiménezJesús Calvo Guadamuro\n | Romania 0–0 France, Austria 0–1 Germany |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Peter Fröjdfeldt | Stefan WittbergHenrik Andrén\n | Netherlands 3–0 Italy, Turkey 3–2 Czech Republic, Portugal 2–3 Germany (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Massimo Busacca | Matthias ArnetStéphane Cuhat\n | Greece 0–2 Sweden, Netherlands 2–0 Romania, Germany 3–2 Turkey (Semi-final) |\n\n\n**Fourth officials**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Ivan Bebek |\n| ![](image) France | Stéphane Lannoy |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Viktor Kassai |\n| ![](image) Iceland | Kristinn Jakobsson |\n| ![](image) Poland | Grzegorz Gilewski |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Olegário Benquerença |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Craig Thomson |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | Damir Skomina |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Performance of the participating countries during Euro 2008\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progressed to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nFor the three-game group stage of this tournament, where two or more teams in a group tied on an equal number of points, the finishing positions were determined by the following tie-breaking criteria in the following order:[20]\n\n\n\n1. number of points obtained in the matches among the teams in question\n2. goal difference in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)\n3. number of goals scored in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)\n4. goal difference in all the group matches\n5. number of goals scored in all the group matches\n6. coefficient from the qualifying competitions for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2006/08 UEFA European Football Championship (points obtained divided by the number of matches played)\n7. fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament)\n8. drawing of lots\n\n\nHowever, these criteria would not apply if two teams tied on points and goals scored played against each other in their final group match and no other team in group finishes with same points; in that case, the tie would be broken by a penalty shootout.[20]\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Portugal | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 3\n | +2\n | 6[a] | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Turkey | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 6[a] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Czech Republic | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | −2\n | 3[b] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)  Switzerland (H) | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 3[b] |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Head-to-head result: Portugal 2–0 Turkey.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Head-to-head result: Switzerland 0–1 Czech Republic.\n\n7 June 2008 (2008-06-07)\n18:00\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Svěrkoš ![](image) 71'\n |\n\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[23]\nReferee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)\n\n7 June 2008 (2008-06-07)\n20:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Pepe ![](image) 61'\n* Meireles ![](image) 90+3'\n | Report |  |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,106[24]\nReferee: Herbert Fandel (Germany)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n11 June 2008 (2008-06-11)\n18:00\n\n\n| Czech Republic ![](image) | 1–3 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Sionko ![](image) 17'\n | Report | * Deco ![](image) 8'\n* Ronaldo ![](image) 63'\n* Quaresma ![](image) 90+1'\n |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,016[25]\nReferee: Kyros Vassaras (Greece)\n\n11 June 2008 (2008-06-11)\n20:45\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 1–2 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Yakin ![](image) 32'\n | Report | * Semih ![](image) 57'\n* Turan ![](image) 90+2'\n |\n\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[26]\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2008 (2008-06-15)\n20:45\n\n\n| Switzerland ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Yakin ![](image) 71', 83' (pen.)\n | Report |  |\n\nSt. Jakob-Park, Basel\nAttendance: 39,730[27]\nReferee: Konrad Plautz (Austria)\n\n15 June 2008 (2008-06-15)\n20:45\n\n\n| Turkey ![](image) | 3–2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Turan ![](image) 75'\n* Nihat ![](image) 87', 89'\n | Report | * Koller ![](image) 34'\n* Plašil ![](image) 62'\n |\n\nStade de Genève, Geneva\nAttendance: 29,016[28]\nReferee: Peter Fröjdfeldt (Sweden)\n\n### Group B[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 Group B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Croatia | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 4\n | 1\n | +3\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout phase |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Germany | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 2\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Austria (H) | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 3\n | −2\n | 1[a] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Poland | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | −3\n | 1[a] |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Austria 1–1 Poland).

tournaments. Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This meant that two teams who meet in the same group would meet again in the semi-finals instead of the final if they got this far. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues (St. Jakob-Park, Basel and Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna—the two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout phase of the tournament.[47]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST

Player of the Tournament.\n#### UEFA Team of the Tournament[edit]\n\n\nThe UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of nine analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Nine players from the winning Spanish team were named in the team of the tournament, while no players knocked out in the group stage were included. Four players from semi-finalists Russia were also included, the first-time ever there were Russian players in the Team of the Tournament following the fall of the Soviet Union.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Italy](image) Gianluigi Buffon![Netherlands](image) Edwin van der Sar![Spain](image) Iker Casillas | ![Germany](image) Philipp Lahm![Portugal](image) José Bosingwa![Portugal](image) Pepe![Russia](image) Yuri Zhirkov![Spain](image) Carlos Marchena![Spain](image) Carles Puyol | ![Croatia](image) Luka Modrić![Germany](image) Michael Ballack![Germany](image) Lukas Podolski![Netherlands](image) Wesley Sneijder![Russia](image) Konstantin Zyryanov![Spain](image) Cesc Fàbregas![Spain](image) Andrés Iniesta![Spain](image) Marcos Senna![Spain](image) Xavi![Turkey](image) Hamit Altıntop | ![Russia](image) Andrey Arshavin![Russia](image) Roman Pavlyuchenko![Spain](image) Fernando Torres![Spain](image) David Villa |\n\n\n#### UEFA Player of the Tournament[edit]\n\n\nThe UEFA Technical Team also had to pick a Player of the Tournament, taking fans' votes into account. The player chosen was Spain midfielder Xavi.[55]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Xavi\n\n\n#### Golden Boot[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Boot was awarded to yet another Spaniard, David Villa, who scored four goals, three of which came in his side's 4–1 win over Russia (the only hat-trick scored in the tournament).[56]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) David Villa (4 goals)\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nUEFA announced that total of €184 million has been offered to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, increasing from €129 million in the previous tournament. The distributions as below:[57]\n\n\n\n* Prize for participating: €7.5 million\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\n\n\n* Winner: €7.5 million\n* Runner-up: €4.5 million\n* Semi-finals: €3 million\n* Quarter-finals: €2 million\n* Group stage (per match):\n\t+ Win: €1 million\n\t+ Draw: €500,000\n\n\nSpain, as winners of the tournament and winners of all three of their group stage matches, received a total prize of €23 million, the maximum possible prize money. Greece on the other hand, being the only team to lose all three of their group matches, were the only team to receive nothing more than the €7.5 million participation prize.\n\n\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2008, players may be suspended from playing in subsequent matches upon the collection of a certain number of yellow or red cards. If a player is shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – that player is suspended from playing in his team's next match. If his team is eliminated from the competition before the end of his suspension, the games carry over to the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. A player is also suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated are annulled once a team is eliminated from the tournament or reaches the semi-finals.[58]\n\n\nIn extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA may choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension is required. One case of this at Euro 2008 was the suspension of Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Demirel for two matches for pushing Czech striker Jan Koller.[59]\n\n\nThe following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Offence(s)\n | Suspension(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Russia](image) Andrey Arshavin | ![Red card](image) in Euro qualifying v Andorra | Group D v SpainGroup D v Greece |\n| ![Germany](image) Bastian Schweinsteiger | ![Red card](image) in Group B v Croatia | Group B v Austria |\n| ![Austria](image) Sebastian Prödl | ![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Croatia![Yellow card](image) in Group B v Poland | Group B v Germany |\n| ![Romania](image) Dorin Goian | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v France![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Italy | Group C v Netherlands |\n| ![Turkey](image) Mehmet Aurélio | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Switzerland![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic | Quarter-final v Croatia |\n| ![Turkey](image) Volkan Demirel | ![Red card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic | Quarter-final v CroatiaSemi-final v Germany |\n| ![France](image) Eric Abidal | ![Red card](image) in Group C v Italy | World Cup qualifying v Austria |\n| ![Italy](image) Andrea Pirlo | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Romania![Yellow card](image) in Group C v France | Quarter-final v Spain |\n| ![Italy](image) Gennaro Gattuso | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Netherlands![Yellow card](image) in Group C v France | Quarter-final v Spain |\n| ![Turkey](image) Tuncay Şanlı | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Switzerland![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Croatia | Semi-final v Germany |\n| ![Turkey](image) Arda Turan | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Croatia | Semi-final v Germany |\n| ![Turkey](image) Emre Aşık | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Czech Republic![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Croatia | Semi-final v Germany |\n| ![Russia](image) Denis Kolodin | ![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Sweden![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Netherlands | Semi-final v Spain |\n| ![Russia](image) Dmitri Torbinski | ![Yellow card](image) in Group D v Greece![Yellow card](image) in Quarter-final v Netherlands | Semi-final v Spain |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Television coverage failure[edit]\n\n\nThree times in the second half of the semi-final between Germany and Turkey, nearly the entire global television coverage of the game was interrupted. A thunderstorm over Vienna caused technical difficulties in the International Broadcast Centre (IBC), which relayed the television feed from the match in Basel, Switzerland, resulting in one or more goals being missed by various audiences.[60] Various national broadcasters took emergency contingency measures such as reverting to radio broadcasting (for example, the BBC used coverage from Radio 5 Live,[61] Ireland circumvented the problem by having RTÉ Two's studio presenter Bill O'Herlihy and panellists Eamon Dunphy, Johnny Giles and Liam Brady provide emergency discussion on what had happened in the match,[62] and Øyvind Alsaker, commentator from Norwegian TV2 picked up his mobile and filmed it over a 3G connection). Only the Swiss public broadcaster SRG maintained full coverage since it used a direct signal other than the IBC's.[63]\n\n\n\n### New trophy[edit]\n\n\nA new trophy was awarded to the winners of the Euro 2008 tournament. The new version of the Henri Delaunay Trophy, created by Asprey London,[64] is almost an exact replica of the original designed by Arthus-Bertrand. A small figure juggling a ball on the back of the original has been removed, as has the marble plinth. The silver base of the trophy also had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have now been engraved on the back of the trophy, which is made of sterling silver, weighs 8 kilograms (17.6 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall.\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large model of the *adidas Europass* prior to the final between Germany and Spain\nThe match ball for the finals was unveiled at the draw ceremony. Produced by Adidas and named the *Europass*, it is a 14-panel ball in the same construction as the Teamgeist, but with a modified surface design.[65] A version named the *Europass Gloria* was used in the final.[66]\n\n\nThere were concerns raised about the match ball, which was claimed to deviate unpredictably in flight, making it difficult to judge for goalkeepers. Notable players to criticise were Germany's Jens Lehmann and the Czech Republic's Petr Čech.[67] These claims were disputed by the ball's designer, Oliver Kahn.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nThe official melody was composed by Rollo Armstrong of Faithless on behalf of UEFA.[68] The official Euro 2008 song was \"Can You Hear Me\" by Enrique Iglesias, which was performed live during the official closing ceremony prior to the final in Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna on 29 June.[69]\n\n\nTwo soundtracks, \"Like a Superstar\" and \"Feel the Rush,\" were recorded by Jamaican reggae artist Shaggy as mascot songs for Euro 2008. They formed a musical background to video clips featuring the twin mascots Trix and Flix.[68]\n\n\nThe official Swiss song for the tournament was a new version of \"Bring en hei\" (*Bring him Home*) by Baschi.[69] Christina Stürmer sang the official tournament song of Austrian ÖFB, \"Fieber\" (*Fever*).[70] Croatia manager Slaven Bilić recorded his country's official Euro 2008 song, \"Vatreno ludilo\" (\"Fiery Madness\"), with his rock group, Rawbau.\n\n\n\"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes was played when players walked out before kick-off,[71] and a remix of \"Samba de Janeiro\" by German dance group Bellini was played after each goal scored in the competition.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship mascot\n\nThe two official mascots for UEFA Euro 2008, were named after a vote from the public of the two host nations from the following options:\n\n\n\n* Zigi and Zagi\n* Flitz and Bitz\n* Trix and Flix\n\n\nIn April 2007, after receiving 36.3% of the vote, Trix and Flix were chosen. \"I am sure the mascots and their names will become a vital part of the understanding of the whole event,\" said Christian Mutschler, the tournament director for Switzerland.[74] The mascots were unveiled on 27 September 2006, in Vienna, Austria. Their official début was on 11 October 2006, at the Austria vs. Switzerland friendly, which ended 2–1.[75]\n\n\n\n### Slogan[edit]\n\n\nThe slogan for UEFA Euro 2008 was chosen on 24 January 2007: *Expect Emotions*.[76] UEFA President Michel Platini stated, \"It describes in a nutshell what the UEFA Euro 2008 has to offer: all kinds of emotions – joy, disappointment, relief or high tension – right up to the final whistle.\"[77]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n**Global Sponsors:**\n\n\n\n* Adidas\n* Canon Inc[78]\n* Carlsberg Group\n* Castrol[79]\n* Coca-Cola\n* Continental\n* Hyundai Motor Group/Kia Corporation\n* JVC\n* MasterCard\n* McDonald's\n\n\n**National Supporters (Switzerland):**\n\n\n\n* UBS[80]\n* Swisscom[81]\n* Ferrero Switzerland (Kinder Chocolate, Nutella, Ferrero Rocher)[82]\n\n\n**National Supporters (Austria):**\n\n\n\n* Telekom austria[83]\n* Österreichische Post\n* UniCredit\n\n\nHublot were the official watch and timekeeper of the tournament,[84] while Intersport became the official retail licensee.[85]\n\n\nBenQ were initially announced as one of the global sponsors of the tournament,[86] shortly after its mobile phone branch in Germany filed for insolvency.[87] The deal was later cancelled.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2008 broadcasting rights\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Euro 2008 contenders\". *BBC Sport*. 9 December 2002.

The final tournament was hosted for the first time in Portugal, from 12 June to 4 July 2004.[1][2] A total of 31 matches were played in ten venues across eight cities – Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Guimarães, Faro/Loulé, Leiria, Lisbon, and Porto.\n\n\nAs in 1996 and 2000, the final tournament was contested by 16 teams: the hosts plus the 15 teams that came through the qualifying tournament, which began in September 2002. Latvia secured their first participation in a major tournament after overcoming Turkey in the play-offs, while Greece returned to the European Championship after 24 years.\n\n\nThe tournament was rich in surprises and upsets: Traditional powerhouses Germany, Spain, and Italy were eliminated in the group stage, while defending champions France were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Greece. Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match.[3] Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas.[4] Greece's triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, one of the tableaux depicted a ship – symbolising the voyages of the Portuguese explorers – sailing through a sea that transformed into the flags of all competing countries.[5] In the closing ceremony, Portuguese-Canadian singer Nelly Furtado performed her single and official tournament theme song, \"Força\".\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 bids\n\nPortugal were announced as hosts for UEFA Euro 2004 on 12 October 1999, in Aachen, Germany, beating Spain and the joint bid of Austria and Hungary.[1]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nGroup A opened with a shock as Greece, ranked outsiders from start, defeated the hosts 2–1. Giorgos Karagounis put the Greeks ahead after only seven minutes and Angelos Basinas made it 2–0 from the penalty spot on 51 minutes. A stoppage-time goal by Cristiano Ronaldo proved no more than a consolation.[6] Greece then drew with Spain[7] before losing to Russia in their last group stage game.[8] Portugal recovered from their opening defeat by defeating Russia 2–0, who had their keeper Sergei Ovchinnikov sent off.[9] Nuno Gomes scored the winning goal against Spain,[10] which ensured Portugal finished top of Group A. Greece advanced to the quarter-finals as runners-up, ahead of Spain on goals scored.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Opening ceremony at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto\nDefending champions France scored twice in stoppage time to go from 1–0 down to beat England 2–1. Zinedine Zidane scored both goals; the second from the penalty spot.[12] England's other two games were memorable for the performances of their young star Wayne Rooney. Only 18 at the time, Rooney's goal-scoring ability proved instrumental in victories over Switzerland (3–0) and Croatia (4–2).[13][14] France and England qualified from the group as winners and runners-up respectively.[15]\n\n\nGroup C featured a three-way tie between Sweden, Denmark and Italy. All matches between the three sides had ended in draws and all three had beaten Bulgaria.[16][17][18] Italy were ultimately eliminated on the number of goals scored after Sweden and Denmark drew 2–2 and qualified as group winners and runners-up.[19][20] The Italians accused Sweden and Denmark of fixing their match,[21] as both sides knew that a 2–2 result would advance them both over Italy, but UEFA dismissed the complaint.[22]\n\n\nThe Czech Republic won Group D as the only team to win all three of their group matches. They defeated Latvia 2–1,[23] the Netherlands 3–2,[24] and Germany 2–1.[25] It was another disappointing European campaign for the Germans, who failed to advance from the group stage for the second consecutive time.[26] The Netherlands claimed a quarter-final berth as runners-up.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Swedish striker Henrik Larsson taking a free kick against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals\nIn the first quarter-final between England and Portugal, the English opened the score after only two minutes through Michael Owen. Portugal's constant attacking pressure from then on resulted in Hélder Postiga's 83rd-minute equaliser. In the dying minutes, Owen hit the Portuguese crossbar and Sol Campbell headed in the rebound, but the goal was ruled out by referee Urs Meier for a foul on the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo. The sides exchanged goals in extra-time, sending the match to a penalty shoot-out. Portugal won 6–5, as Ricardo saved from Darius Vassell and then scored the winning goal himself.[28]\n\n\nThe Greeks, meanwhile, continued to stun everybody. Firm defensive play and an Angelos Charisteas goal on 65 minutes helped Greece defeat France 1–0 and progress to the semi-finals.[29] This victory made Greece the first team to defeat both the holders and the hosts in the same tournament. Sweden and the Netherlands played out an exciting but goalless encounter, even after a dramatic period of extra-time in which Freddie Ljungberg hit the inside of the Dutch goalpost. The Dutch progressed after winning the penalty shoot-out 5–4, their first victory on penalties in a major tournament.[30] The last quarter-final match saw the Czechs dispatch Denmark, as a two-goal effort from Milan Baroš helped seal a 3–0 win.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Angelos Charisteas (first from left with white shirt), scoring Greece's winner against Portugal in the final.\nPortugal and the Netherlands faced each other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 with a spectacular goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts,[32] after their opening day failure, were through to the final of the European Championship for the first time. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favourites to take the trophy, having won all four of their games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless until the dying moments of the first half of extra time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.[33]\n\n\nThe final was a repeat of the opening game of the tournament and Portugal were hoping to avenge their defeat. Portugal attacked and dominated possession but once again, sturdy defending and goalkeeping from Greece kept the hosts off the scoreboard. Just before the hour mark, Greece earned a corner kick from which Angelos Charisteas scored. Portugal continued to press after the goal but even with five minutes of stoppage time, they could not find an equaliser. Greece won the match 1–0 and were crowned European champions,[34] a title that they were given a 150–1 chance of winning before the tournament.[35] All of Greece's wins in the knockout stage came in an identical manner: a 1–0 win, with the goal being a header off a cross from the right wing. Portugal became the first host nation to lose in a European Championship final.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the qualifying round was held on 25 January 2002 at the Europarque Congress Centre, in Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Fifty teams were divided into ten groups of five and each team played two matches against all its opponents, on a home-and-away basis. Qualification matches took place from September 2002 to November 2003. The first-placed teams from each group qualified automatically to the final tournament, whereas the ten runners-up took part in a two-legged play-off to select the remaining five teams that would join the host nation in the final tournament.[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nTen of the sixteen finalists participated in the previous tournament in 2000. Latvia made its first appearance in a major football competition, while Greece returned to the European Championship finals after a 24-year absence. Bulgaria, Croatia, Russia and Switzerland also took part in their second tournament finals since their debut in 1996.\n\n\nAs of 2022, this was the last time that Bulgaria qualified for the European Championship finals and also the last time Bulgaria qualified to a major tournament, the only time that Latvia qualified, as well as the last time that Poland failed to qualify.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Host | 12 October 1999 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 3 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 4 winner | 10 September 2003 | 2 (*1992*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Group 8 winner | 10 September 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 2 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 5 winner | 11 October 2003 | 8 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group 6 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 9 winner | 11 October 2003 | 5 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group 10 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Latvia | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 6 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 6 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[D] | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 7 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\n* The group stage draw took place on 30 November 2003 at the Pavilhão Atlântico in Lisbon, Portugal, and was televised live: Euro 2004 Draw on BBC Sport.\n\n\nThe 16 qualified finalists were drawn from four seeded pots into four groups. The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored.[38] As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France (holders)[b] | 3.000 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2.389 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 2.333 | 4\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2.313 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 2.313 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) England | 2.313 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2.188 | 9\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 2.167 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 2.125 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 2.056 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 2.056 | 14\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | 1.889 | 18\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 1.611 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | 1.563 | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Latvia | 1.250 | 32\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Hosts Portugal (coefficient 2.400; rank 2nd) belonged to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position. Ahead of the draw, they were automatically assigned to group position A1, and consequently removed from pot 1.\n2. **^** Defending champions France (coefficient 3.000; rank 1st) were automatically assigned to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position, and could be drawn into either Group B, C or D.\n\nThe Pot 1 teams were assigned to the first positions of their groups. For the purpose of determining the exact match schedules in each group, the 2nd/3rd/4th group positions were drawn separately for all other teams drawn from pot 2-4. The draw started by using pot 4 to draw one team to each of the four groups in alphabetic order from A to D. This same procedure was followed for pot 3 and pot 2. Finally the three remaining teams from pot 1 were drawn in alphabetic order into group B, C and D.[41]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[42][41]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| A2 | ![](image) Greece |\n| A3 | ![](image) Spain |\n| A4 | ![](image) Russia |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) France |\n| B2 | ![](image) England |\n| B3 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| B4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| C2 | ![](image) Bulgaria |\n| C3 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| C4 | ![](image) Italy |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| D2 | ![](image) Latvia |\n| D3 | ![](image) Germany |\n| D4 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nThe final tournament was played in ten venues located in eight different cities. Lisbon and Porto, the two biggest cities, had two venues each, while Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Faro-Loulé, Guimarães and Leiria had one venue. In order to meet UEFA's requirements on venue capacity and infrastructure, seven new stadiums were built – Estádio Municipal de Aveiro (Aveiro),[43] Estádio Municipal de Braga (Braga),[44] Estádio Algarve (Faro-Loulé),[45] Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa (Leiria),[46] Estádio da Luz (Lisbon),[47] Estádio José Alvalade (Lisbon),[48] and Estádio do Dragão (Porto)[49] – and three underwent renovation works – Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (Coimbra),[50] Estádio D. Afonso Henriques (Guimarães),[51] and Estádio do Bessa (Porto).[52] The Estádio da Luz was the largest stadium with a tournament capacity of 65,647 seats, and served as the venue for the final. The opening ceremony and match took place at the Estádio do Dragão.\n\n\nThis was the first European Championship where matches took place in more than eight venues since the tournament was expanded to 16 teams in 1996.[53]\n\n\nThe table below lists stadium capacity for the final tournament, which may not correspond to their effective maximum capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 2004 is located in Portugal](image)![Lisbon](image)\nLisbon\n![Aveiro](image)\nAveiro\n![Porto](image)\nPorto\n![Coimbra](image)\nCoimbra\n![Braga](image)\nBraga\n![Guimarães](image)\nGuimarães\n![Faro/Loulé](image)\nFaro/Loulé\n![Leiria](image)\nLeiria\n | Lisbon | Aveiro |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Estádio da Luz | Estádio José Alvalade | Estádio Municipal de Aveiro |\n| Capacity: **65,647** | Capacity: **50,095** | Capacity: **32,830** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Porto | Faro/Loulé |\n| Estádio do Dragão | Estádio do Bessa | Estádio Algarve |\n| Capacity: **50,033** | Capacity: **28,263** | Capacity: **30,305** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Braga | Guimarães | Coimbra | Leiria |\n| Estádio Municipal de Braga | Estádio D.

Applicants could request a maximum of four tickets per match but were limited to one match per day. In parallel to individual match tickets, UEFA created a new category of tickets called \"Follow My Team\", which allowed supporters to see all the matches of their favourite team (group stage and, if qualified, knockout stage matches). If there were oversubscribed matches by the end of the first phase of sales, a match-specific draw would take place to select the successful applicants.[55]\n\n\nBetween 1 August and 24 November 2003, available tickets were placed again on sale in a first-come, first-served basis.[58] After the draw for the group stage on 30 November, a third phase of public sales began on 9 December, which included a second batch of tickets (39%) that could be bought until March 2004 through the national associations of the finalist teams.[59] Every national association was awarded 20% of the venue capacity for each of their team's matches.[55] From 1 to 30 April 2004, surplus tickets from UEFA or national associations were made available to the public for the last time.[60] Ticket distribution began in May, after sales were officially closed.[55]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team was provided a base camp for residence and daily training between tournament matches. An initial list of 25 bases approved by the Portuguese Football Federation, following a selection process started in November 2001, was announced by the organisation on 5 February 2003.[61]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bulgaria\n | Póvoa de Varzim |\n| Croatia\n | Coruche |\n| Czech Republic\n | Sintra |\n| Denmark\n | Portimão |\n| England\n | Oeiras |\n| France\n | Santo Tirso |\n| Germany\n | Almancil |\n| Greece\n | Vila do Conde |\n| Italy\n | Lisbon |\n| Latvia\n | Anadia |\n| Netherlands\n | Albufeira |\n| Portugal\n | Alcochete |\n| Russia\n | Vilamoura |\n| Spain\n | Braga |\n| Sweden\n | Estoril |\n| Switzerland\n | Óbidos |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he would be replaced by another player.\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 December 2003, UEFA revealed the twelve referees and four fourth officials.[62] Each refereeing team was composed by one main referee and two assistant referees from the same country. In April 2004, the UEFA Referees Committee replaced Russian assistant referee Gennady Krasyuk with Yuri Dupanov of Belarus.[63] The switch was made after Krasyuk incorrectly disallowed a second goal from Paul Scholes for offside in the Champions League round of 16 second leg between Manchester United and Porto.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistant referees\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Kim Milton Nielsen | Jens LarsenJørgen Jepsen\n | Croatia 2–2 France (group B)Netherlands 3–0 Latvia (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Mike Riley | Philip SharpGlenn Turner\n | Sweden 5–0 Bulgaria (group C)Latvia 0–0 Germany (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Gilles Veissière | Frédéric ArnaultSerge Vallin\n | Russia 2–1 Greece (group A)Czech Republic 2–1 Latvia (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | Markus Merk | Christian SchräerJan-Hendrik Salver\n | France 2–1 England (group B)Denmark 2–2 Sweden (group C)Portugal 0–1 Greece (Final)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Pierluigi Collina | Marco IvaldiNarciso Pisacreta\n | Portugal 1–2 Greece (group A)Croatia 2–4 England (group B)Greece 1–0 Czech Republic (semi-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | Terje Hauge | Ole Hermann BorganSteinar Holvik\n | Russia 0–2 Portugal (group A)Germany 1–2 Czech Republic (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Lucílio Batista | José CardinalPaulo Januário\n | Switzerland 0–0 Croatia (group B)Bulgaria 0–2 Denmark (group C)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | Valentin Ivanov | ~~Gennady Krasyuk~~Vladimir Eniutin![Belarus](image) Yuri Dupanov\n | England 3–0 Switzerland (group B)Italy 2–1 Bulgaria (group C)Czech Republic 3–0 Denmark (quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Ľuboš Micheľ | Igor ŠramkaMartin Balko\n | Greece 1–1 Spain (group A)Switzerland 1–3 France (group B)Sweden 0–0 Netherlands (quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Manuel Mejuto González | Oscar Martínez SamaniegoRafael Guerrero Alonso\n | Denmark 0–0 Italy (group C)Netherlands 2–3 Czech Republic (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Anders Frisk | Kenneth PeterssonPeter Ekström\n | Spain 0–1 Portugal (group A)Germany 1–1 Netherlands (group D)France 0–1 Greece (quarter-final)Portugal 2–1 Netherlands (semi-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Urs Meier | Francesco BuraginaRudolf Käppeli\n | Spain 1–0 Russia (group A)Italy 1–1 Sweden (group C)Portugal 2–2 England (quarter-final)\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth official\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Frank De Bleeckere |\n| ![](image) Greece | Kyros Vassaras |\n| ![](image) Luxembourg | Alain Hamer |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Stuart Dougal |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2004 finalists and their result\nUEFA announced the match schedule for the final tournament on 10 March 2003, in Porto, Portugal. In a change from the previous tournament schedule, where two quarter-final matches were played per day, over two days, the quarter-finals at the Euro 2004 were to be played over four consecutive days, with one match per day.[65][66]\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[67][68]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n5. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n6. If on the last round of the group stage, two teams are facing each other and each has the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finishes level in their match, their ranking is determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion is not used if more than two teams have the same number of points.);\n7.

There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions. Any game in the knockout stage that was not decided by the end of the regular 90 minutes was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves).\n\n\nFor the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.[70] If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round.[70] The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Quarter-finals |  | Semi-finals |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 24 June – Lisbon (Luz) |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **![](image) Portugal (p)** | **2 (6)** |\n|  | 30 June – Lisbon (Alvalade) |\n|  | ![](image) England | 2 (5)\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Portugal** | **2** |\n|  | 26 June – Faro/Loulé |\n|  |  | ![](image) Netherlands | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Sweden | 0 (4) |\n|  |  | 4 July – Lisbon (Luz) |\n|  | **![](image) Netherlands (p)** | **0 (5)** |  |\n|  | ![](image) Portugal | 0 |\n|  | 25 June – Lisbon (Alvalade) |\n|  |  | **![](image) Greece** | **1** |\n|  | ![](image) France | 0 |\n|  | 1 July – Porto (Dragão) |  |\n|  | **![](image) Greece** | **1** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Greece (s.g.)** | **1** |\n|  | 27 June – Porto (Dragão) |\n|  |  | ![](image) Czech Republic | 0\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Czech Republic** | **3** |\n|  |  |\n|  | ![](image) Denmark | 0\n |  |\n|  |\n\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\n24 June 2004 (2004-06-24)\n19:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–2 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) England |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Postiga ![](image) 83'\n* Rui Costa ![](image) 110'\n | Report | * Owen ![](image) 3'\n* Lampard ![](image) 115'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Deco ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Simão ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Rui Costa ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Ronaldo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Maniche ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Postiga ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ricardo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 6–5 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Beckham\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Owen\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Lampard\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Terry\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hargreaves\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) A.

Michael Ballack and Gianluca Zambrotta were the only players to be included whose teams were knocked out in the group stage.[74][75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Theodoros Zagorakis, UEFA Player of the Tournament\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Czech Republic](image) Petr Čech![Greece](image) Antonios Nikopolidis | ![England](image) Sol Campbell![England](image) Ashley Cole![Greece](image) Traianos Dellas![Greece](image) Giourkas Seitaridis![Italy](image) Gianluca Zambrotta![Portugal](image) Ricardo Carvalho![Sweden](image) Olof Mellberg | ![Czech Republic](image) Pavel Nedvěd![England](image) Frank Lampard![France](image) Zinedine Zidane![Germany](image) Michael Ballack![Greece](image) Theodoros Zagorakis![Portugal](image) Luís Figo![Portugal](image) Maniche | ![Czech Republic](image) Milan Baroš![Denmark](image) Jon Dahl Tomasson![England](image) Wayne Rooney![Greece](image) Angelos Charisteas![Netherlands](image) Ruud van Nistelrooy![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo![Sweden](image) Henrik Larsson |\n\n\nGolden Boot\nThe Golden Boot was awarded to Milan Baroš, who scored all five of his goals in three group stage matches and in the quarter-finals against Denmark.\n\n\n\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Milan Baroš (5 goals)[76]\n\n\nUEFA Player of the Tournament\n* ![Greece](image) Theodoros Zagorakis[77]\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nOverall, CHF200 million was awarded to the 16 teams, a boost from the CHF120 million in the previous event.[78] Below is a complete list of the allocations:[79]\n\n\n\n* Prize for participating: CHF7.5 million\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performance:\n\n\n\n* Winner: CHF10 million\n* Runner-up: CHF6 million\n* Semi-finals: CHF4 million\n* Quarter-finals: CHF3 million\n* Group stage (per match):\n\t+ Win: CHF1 million\n\t+ Draw: CHF500,000\n\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\n\nIf a player was shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – he would become suspended from playing in his team's next match. A player would also become suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated would be cancelled once a team was eliminated from the tournament or reached the semi-finals. In extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA could choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension would be required.\n\n\nThe following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Offence(s)\n | Suspension(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Russia](image) Roman Sharonov | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group A v Spain | Group A v Portugal |\n| ![Greece](image) Giorgos Karagounis | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Portugal![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Spain | Group A v Russia |\n| ![Yellow card](image) in quarter-final v France![Yellow card](image) in semi-final v Czech Republic | Final v Portugal |\n| ![Greece](image) Zisis Vryzas | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Portugal![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia | Quarter-final v France |\n| ![Russia](image) Sergei Ovchinnikov | ![Red card](image) in Group A v Portugal | Group A v Greece |\n| ![Russia](image) Alexey Smertin | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Spain![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Portugal | Group A v Greece |\n| ![Spain](image) Carlos Marchena | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Greece | Group A v Portugal |\n| ![Switzerland](image) Johann Vogel | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group B v Croatia | Group B v England |\n| ![Switzerland](image) Bernt Haas | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group B v England | Group B v France |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) Rosen Kirilov | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Sweden![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark | Group C v Italy |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) Stiliyan Petrov | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group C v Denmark | Group C v Italy |\n| ![Sweden](image) Tobias Linderoth | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Bulgaria![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Italy | Group C v Denmark |\n| ![Sweden](image) Erik Edman | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Italy![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark | Quarter-final v Netherlands |\n| ![Italy](image) Fabio Cannavaro | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Sweden | Group C v Bulgaria |\n| ![Italy](image) Gennaro Gattuso | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Sweden | Group C v Bulgaria |\n| ![Italy](image) Francesco Totti | Spat on Christian Poulsen in Group C v Denmark | Group C v SwedenGroup C v BulgariaWorld Cup qualifying v Norway |\n| ![Netherlands](image) John Heitinga | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group D v Czech Republic | Group D v Latvia |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Logo, mascot and official song[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2004 mascot, Kinas\nThe official tournament logo was created by Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper agency and unveiled on 13 May 2002 at a ceremony held in Lisbon's Belém Cultural Center.[80] It represents a football in the centre of a heart, surrounded by seven green dots. The football – displaying typical Portuguese folk artistic motifs on its panels – and the heart – shaped in the traditional style of the filigree art from Viana do Castelo – conveyed the football passion of the host country. The seven dots represent significant Portuguese elements and achievements, such as the number of castles in the national coat of arms or the conquest of the seven seas during the Age of Discoveries. The logo's colour palette was based on the Portuguese flag and its warm tones recall the light and sun associated with the Portuguese landscape and climate.[81][82] The competition slogan used was \"Vive O 2004!\" (English: Live 2004!).[83][84]\n\n\nThe official mascot was a boy named Kinas – derived from *quinas* (English: inescutcheons), one of the symbols of the Portuguese coat of arms[85] – who wore a football kit with the Portuguese colours (red shirt and green shorts) and was constantly playing with a football. He possessed the knowledge and talent of generations of highly gifted football players, and embodied the energy and passion of football.[86] Created by Warner Bros., Kinas was officially unveiled on 29 March 2003 at the Casa de Serralves, in Porto, Portugal.[85]\n\n\nThe official song, called \"Força\" (English: Strength), was written and performed by Portuguese-Canadian singer Nelly Furtado.[87] The song was taken from her second studio album, *Folklore*, and released as its third single, soon after the start of the tournament. Furtado was selected to sing the official song of the tournament, because of her familial connection to the host country (her parents are both Portuguese from the Azores).[88] She wrote \"Força\" with \"the passion the Portuguese people have for football\" in mind.[88] The song was played at every match, and performed live by Furtado at the closing ceremony prior to the final.[89][90]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Roteiro\n\nThe official match ball was presented during the final draw ceremony on 30 November 2003 in Lisbon.[91][92] It was produced by Adidas and named Adidas Roteiro, after the logbook (Portuguese: *roteiro*) used by Portuguese maritime explorers such as Vasco da Gama.[91] Roteiro was the first official tournament football to employ the new thermal-bonding technique in its production, which resulted in a seamless surface and a more homogeneous design.[91] Portuguese Football Federation president Gilberto Madaíl praised the ball, stating: \"Adidas has delivered a stunning, modern and state-of the-art Portuguese football. This is very much how we envisage the UEFA Euro 2004 event to be\".[91] Roteiro was also used at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup,[93] and during the mid-season of the 2004–05 German Bundesliga.[94]\n\n\nThe new ball received mixed reactions from players and technical staffs. England midfielder David Beckham, who was asked by Adidas to test it, was pleased with Roteiro's performance, particularly in free-kicks.[91] France midfielder Zinedine Zidane believed the ball would \"improve the game\".[94] Several Spanish players, however, regarded it as \"horrible, difficult to control and to pass\", with Real Madrid footballer Iván Helguera describing it as a \"beach ball\".[95] Notable players of the Italy national team, such as Francesco Totti, Andrea Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon also voiced criticisms.[96]\n\n\n\n### Trophy tour[edit]\n\n\nDuring the two months ahead of the tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy travelled across Portugal to promote the European Championship finals in the host country. The tour began on 8 April 2004 at the Praça do Comércio in Lisbon, where the launching ceremony took place with the presence of Portuguese football legend and tournament ambassador Eusébio.[97] A total of twenty towns and cities were visited by the trophy tour caravan, including the ten that would host matches.[98]\n\n\n\n\n\nTrophy tour stops and dates\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Lisbon (8–11 April)\n* Setúbal (10–14 April)\n* Faro/Loulé (15–18 April)\n* Beja (20–22 April)\n* Évora (23–25 April)\n | * Portalegre (27–29 April)\n* Santarém (30 April–2 May)\n* Leiria (4–6 May)\n* Castelo Branco (7–8 May)\n* Coimbra (10–13 May)\n | * Aveiro (13–15 May)\n* Guarda (16–17 May)\n* Viseu (18–19 May)\n* Bragança (21–23 May)\n* Vila Real (24–25 May)\n | * Viana do Castelo (27–28 May)\n* Guimarães (29 May – 1 June)\n* Braga (2–4 June)\n* Porto (6–11 June)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n### Merchandise and memorabilia[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2002, UEFA appointed Warner Bros. Consumer Products (WBCP) as the tournament's exclusive worldwide licensing agent.[99] As the global licensing rights owner, WBCP was responsible for negotiating product licence contracts with third parties on the behalf of UEFA and delineate product sales strategies across the host country. Other tasks included setting up and managing marketing plans, product distribution and prices, and prevent illegal use of trademarks and product sales.[100] Over 2,000 merchandise items were developed by the 28 licencees chosen by WBCP, and were distributed not only within Portugal but also in major European and Asian markets.[101]\n\n\nTo celebrate Portugal's hosting of the Euro 2004 finals, commemorative coin and stamp collections were issued by the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda, the Portuguese national mint and printing house,[102] and CTT, the national postal service.[103]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA distinguishes between global sponsors and national sponsors. Global Euro sponsors can come from any country and have together exclusive worldwide sponsorship rights for a UEFA European Football Championship. National sponsors come from the host country and do only have sponsorship rights within that country.[104] Eight sponsors were announced by UEFA in December 2002.[105]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global sponsors\n | National sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[106]\n* BenQ[107]\n* Canon[108]\n* Carlsberg[109]\n* Coca-Cola[110]\n* Hyundai[111]\n | * JVC[112]\n* MasterCard[113]\n* McDonald's[114]\n* NTT/Verio[115]\n* PT[116]\n* T-Mobile[117]\n\n\n |\n | * BPI[118]\n* CTT[119]\n* Galp Energia[120]\n* Portucel Soporcel[121]\n* Vista Alegre Atlantis Group[122]\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 broadcasting rights\n\nNineteen cameras were used in each of the ten venues to broadcast the live matches, with three additional cameras in the opening and knockout stage matches.[123][124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Vive O 2004!*, the official album for UEFA Euro 2004\n* *UEFA Euro 2004*, the official video game for UEFA Euro 2004\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Euro Championships lowdown\".

The final tournament was hosted for the first time in Portugal, from 12 June to 4 July 2004.[1][2] A total of 31 matches were played in ten venues across eight cities – Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Guimarães, Faro/Loulé, Leiria, Lisbon, and Porto.\n\n\nAs in 1996 and 2000, the final tournament was contested by 16 teams: the hosts plus the 15 teams that came through the qualifying tournament, which began in September 2002. Latvia secured their first participation in a major tournament after overcoming Turkey in the play-offs, while Greece returned to the European Championship after 24 years.\n\n\nThe tournament was rich in surprises and upsets: Traditional powerhouses Germany, Spain, and Italy were eliminated in the group stage, while defending champions France were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Greece. Portugal recovered from an opening defeat against Greece to reach the final, eliminating England and the Netherlands along the way. For the first time in a major European football tournament, the last match featured the same teams as the opening match.[3] Portugal were again defeated by Greece with a goal from Angelos Charisteas.[4] Greece's triumph was unexpected, considering that they had only qualified for two other major tournaments: UEFA Euro 1980, at which they managed just one point, and the 1994 FIFA World Cup, where they lost all three matches. As winners, Greece earned the right to represent Europe at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, one of the tableaux depicted a ship – symbolising the voyages of the Portuguese explorers – sailing through a sea that transformed into the flags of all competing countries.[5] In the closing ceremony, Portuguese-Canadian singer Nelly Furtado performed her single and official tournament theme song, \"Força\".\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 bids\n\nPortugal were announced as hosts for UEFA Euro 2004 on 12 October 1999, in Aachen, Germany, beating Spain and the joint bid of Austria and Hungary.[1]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nGroup A opened with a shock as Greece, ranked outsiders from start, defeated the hosts 2–1. Giorgos Karagounis put the Greeks ahead after only seven minutes and Angelos Basinas made it 2–0 from the penalty spot on 51 minutes. A stoppage-time goal by Cristiano Ronaldo proved no more than a consolation.[6] Greece then drew with Spain[7] before losing to Russia in their last group stage game.[8] Portugal recovered from their opening defeat by defeating Russia 2–0, who had their keeper Sergei Ovchinnikov sent off.[9] Nuno Gomes scored the winning goal against Spain,[10] which ensured Portugal finished top of Group A. Greece advanced to the quarter-finals as runners-up, ahead of Spain on goals scored.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Opening ceremony at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto\nDefending champions France scored twice in stoppage time to go from 1–0 down to beat England 2–1. Zinedine Zidane scored both goals; the second from the penalty spot.[12] England's other two games were memorable for the performances of their young star Wayne Rooney. Only 18 at the time, Rooney's goal-scoring ability proved instrumental in victories over Switzerland (3–0) and Croatia (4–2).[13][14] France and England qualified from the group as winners and runners-up respectively.[15]\n\n\nGroup C featured a three-way tie between Sweden, Denmark and Italy. All matches between the three sides had ended in draws and all three had beaten Bulgaria.[16][17][18] Italy were ultimately eliminated on the number of goals scored after Sweden and Denmark drew 2–2 and qualified as group winners and runners-up.[19][20] The Italians accused Sweden and Denmark of fixing their match,[21] as both sides knew that a 2–2 result would advance them both over Italy, but UEFA dismissed the complaint.[22]\n\n\nThe Czech Republic won Group D as the only team to win all three of their group matches. They defeated Latvia 2–1,[23] the Netherlands 3–2,[24] and Germany 2–1.[25] It was another disappointing European campaign for the Germans, who failed to advance from the group stage for the second consecutive time.[26] The Netherlands claimed a quarter-final berth as runners-up.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Swedish striker Henrik Larsson taking a free kick against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals\nIn the first quarter-final between England and Portugal, the English opened the score after only two minutes through Michael Owen. Portugal's constant attacking pressure from then on resulted in Hélder Postiga's 83rd-minute equaliser. In the dying minutes, Owen hit the Portuguese crossbar and Sol Campbell headed in the rebound, but the goal was ruled out by referee Urs Meier for a foul on the Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo. The sides exchanged goals in extra-time, sending the match to a penalty shoot-out. Portugal won 6–5, as Ricardo saved from Darius Vassell and then scored the winning goal himself.[28]\n\n\nThe Greeks, meanwhile, continued to stun everybody. Firm defensive play and an Angelos Charisteas goal on 65 minutes helped Greece defeat France 1–0 and progress to the semi-finals.[29] This victory made Greece the first team to defeat both the holders and the hosts in the same tournament. Sweden and the Netherlands played out an exciting but goalless encounter, even after a dramatic period of extra-time in which Freddie Ljungberg hit the inside of the Dutch goalpost. The Dutch progressed after winning the penalty shoot-out 5–4, their first victory on penalties in a major tournament.[30] The last quarter-final match saw the Czechs dispatch Denmark, as a two-goal effort from Milan Baroš helped seal a 3–0 win.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Angelos Charisteas (first from left with white shirt), scoring Greece's winner against Portugal in the final.\nPortugal and the Netherlands faced each other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 with a spectacular goal from the corner of the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts,[32] after their opening day failure, were through to the final of the European Championship for the first time. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favourites to take the trophy, having won all four of their games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless until the dying moments of the first half of extra time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.[33]\n\n\nThe final was a repeat of the opening game of the tournament and Portugal were hoping to avenge their defeat. Portugal attacked and dominated possession but once again, sturdy defending and goalkeeping from Greece kept the hosts off the scoreboard. Just before the hour mark, Greece earned a corner kick from which Angelos Charisteas scored. Portugal continued to press after the goal but even with five minutes of stoppage time, they could not find an equaliser. Greece won the match 1–0 and were crowned European champions,[34] a title that they were given a 150–1 chance of winning before the tournament.[35] All of Greece's wins in the knockout stage came in an identical manner: a 1–0 win, with the goal being a header off a cross from the right wing. Portugal became the first host nation to lose in a European Championship final.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying\n\nThe draw for the qualifying round was held on 25 January 2002 at the Europarque Congress Centre, in Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. Fifty teams were divided into ten groups of five and each team played two matches against all its opponents, on a home-and-away basis. Qualification matches took place from September 2002 to November 2003. The first-placed teams from each group qualified automatically to the final tournament, whereas the ten runners-up took part in a two-legged play-off to select the remaining five teams that would join the host nation in the final tournament.[36][37]\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nTen of the sixteen finalists participated in the previous tournament in 2000. Latvia made its first appearance in a major football competition, while Greece returned to the European Championship finals after a 24-year absence. Bulgaria, Croatia, Russia and Switzerland also took part in their second tournament finals since their debut in 1996.\n\n\nAs of 2022, this was the last time that Bulgaria qualified for the European Championship finals and also the last time Bulgaria qualified to a major tournament, the only time that Latvia qualified, as well as the last time that Poland failed to qualify.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Host | 12 October 1999 | 3 (1984, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996, **2000**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 3 winner | 10 September 2003 | 5 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 4 winner | 10 September 2003 | 2 (*1992*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Group 8 winner | 10 September 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 2 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 5 winner | 11 October 2003 | 8 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Group 6 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 11 October 2003 | 6 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 9 winner | 11 October 2003 | 5 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group 10 winner | 11 October 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Latvia | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 6 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996, *2000*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 6 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[D] | Play-off winner | 19 November 2003 | 7 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992, 1996)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\n* The group stage draw took place on 30 November 2003 at the Pavilhão Atlântico in Lisbon, Portugal, and was televised live: Euro 2004 Draw on BBC Sport.\n\n\nThe 16 qualified finalists were drawn from four seeded pots into four groups. The pot allocations were based on the 2003-edition of the UEFA national team coefficient ranking, which measured performance of teams in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying. The coefficient was calculated by dividing the number of all points scored (three points for a win, one for a draw) by the number of all matches played. Results from the final tournaments, play-off matches and friendly games were all ignored.[38] As host country, Portugal were automatically placed in position A1, and would hereby play the opening match of the final tournament. The remaining 15 teams were split into four pots, with title-holders France seeded alongside Sweden and the Czech Republic in the first pot.[39][40]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1[a]\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France (holders)[b] | 3.000 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2.389 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 2.333 | 4\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2.313 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 2.313 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) England | 2.313 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2.188 | 9\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 2.167 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | 2.125 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | 2.056 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 2.056 | 14\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank[38] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | 1.889 | 18\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | 1.611 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | 1.563 | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Latvia | 1.250 | 32\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Hosts Portugal (coefficient 2.400; rank 2nd) belonged to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position. Ahead of the draw, they were automatically assigned to group position A1, and consequently removed from pot 1.\n2. **^** Defending champions France (coefficient 3.000; rank 1st) were automatically assigned to Pot 1 irrespective of their ranking position, and could be drawn into either Group B, C or D.\n\nThe Pot 1 teams were assigned to the first positions of their groups. For the purpose of determining the exact match schedules in each group, the 2nd/3rd/4th group positions were drawn separately for all other teams drawn from pot 2-4. The draw started by using pot 4 to draw one team to each of the four groups in alphabetic order from A to D. This same procedure was followed for pot 3 and pot 2. Finally the three remaining teams from pot 1 were drawn in alphabetic order into group B, C and D.[41]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[42][41]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| A2 | ![](image) Greece |\n| A3 | ![](image) Spain |\n| A4 | ![](image) Russia |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) France |\n| B2 | ![](image) England |\n| B3 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| B4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| C2 | ![](image) Bulgaria |\n| C3 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| C4 | ![](image) Italy |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| D2 | ![](image) Latvia |\n| D3 | ![](image) Germany |\n| D4 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nThe final tournament was played in ten venues located in eight different cities. Lisbon and Porto, the two biggest cities, had two venues each, while Aveiro, Braga, Coimbra, Faro-Loulé, Guimarães and Leiria had one venue. In order to meet UEFA's requirements on venue capacity and infrastructure, seven new stadiums were built – Estádio Municipal de Aveiro (Aveiro),[43] Estádio Municipal de Braga (Braga),[44] Estádio Algarve (Faro-Loulé),[45] Estádio Dr. Magalhães Pessoa (Leiria),[46] Estádio da Luz (Lisbon),[47] Estádio José Alvalade (Lisbon),[48] and Estádio do Dragão (Porto)[49] – and three underwent renovation works – Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (Coimbra),[50] Estádio D. Afonso Henriques (Guimarães),[51] and Estádio do Bessa (Porto).[52] The Estádio da Luz was the largest stadium with a tournament capacity of 65,647 seats, and served as the venue for the final. The opening ceremony and match took place at the Estádio do Dragão.\n\n\nThis was the first European Championship where matches took place in more than eight venues since the tournament was expanded to 16 teams in 1996.[53]\n\n\nThe table below lists stadium capacity for the final tournament, which may not correspond to their effective maximum capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 2004 is located in Portugal](image)![Lisbon](image)\nLisbon\n![Aveiro](image)\nAveiro\n![Porto](image)\nPorto\n![Coimbra](image)\nCoimbra\n![Braga](image)\nBraga\n![Guimarães](image)\nGuimarães\n![Faro/Loulé](image)\nFaro/Loulé\n![Leiria](image)\nLeiria\n | Lisbon | Aveiro |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Estádio da Luz | Estádio José Alvalade | Estádio Municipal de Aveiro |\n| Capacity: **65,647** | Capacity: **50,095** | Capacity: **32,830** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Porto | Faro/Loulé |\n| Estádio do Dragão | Estádio do Bessa | Estádio Algarve |\n| Capacity: **50,033** | Capacity: **28,263** | Capacity: **30,305** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Braga | Guimarães | Coimbra | Leiria |\n| Estádio Municipal de Braga | Estádio D.

Applicants could request a maximum of four tickets per match but were limited to one match per day. In parallel to individual match tickets, UEFA created a new category of tickets called \"Follow My Team\", which allowed supporters to see all the matches of their favourite team (group stage and, if qualified, knockout stage matches). If there were oversubscribed matches by the end of the first phase of sales, a match-specific draw would take place to select the successful applicants.[55]\n\n\nBetween 1 August and 24 November 2003, available tickets were placed again on sale in a first-come, first-served basis.[58] After the draw for the group stage on 30 November, a third phase of public sales began on 9 December, which included a second batch of tickets (39%) that could be bought until March 2004 through the national associations of the finalist teams.[59] Every national association was awarded 20% of the venue capacity for each of their team's matches.[55] From 1 to 30 April 2004, surplus tickets from UEFA or national associations were made available to the public for the last time.[60] Ticket distribution began in May, after sales were officially closed.[55]\n\n\n\n### Team base camps[edit]\n\n\nEach team was provided a base camp for residence and daily training between tournament matches. An initial list of 25 bases approved by the Portuguese Football Federation, following a selection process started in November 2001, was announced by the organisation on 5 February 2003.[61]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Base camp\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bulgaria\n | Póvoa de Varzim |\n| Croatia\n | Coruche |\n| Czech Republic\n | Sintra |\n| Denmark\n | Portimão |\n| England\n | Oeiras |\n| France\n | Santo Tirso |\n| Germany\n | Almancil |\n| Greece\n | Vila do Conde |\n| Italy\n | Lisbon |\n| Latvia\n | Anadia |\n| Netherlands\n | Albufeira |\n| Portugal\n | Alcochete |\n| Russia\n | Vilamoura |\n| Spain\n | Braga |\n| Sweden\n | Estoril |\n| Switzerland\n | Óbidos |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers, at least ten days before the opening match of the tournament. If a player became injured or ill severely enough to prevent his participation in the tournament before his team's first match, he would be replaced by another player.\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 December 2003, UEFA revealed the twelve referees and four fourth officials.[62] Each refereeing team was composed by one main referee and two assistant referees from the same country. In April 2004, the UEFA Referees Committee replaced Russian assistant referee Gennady Krasyuk with Yuri Dupanov of Belarus.[63] The switch was made after Krasyuk incorrectly disallowed a second goal from Paul Scholes for offside in the Champions League round of 16 second leg between Manchester United and Porto.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistant referees\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Kim Milton Nielsen | Jens LarsenJørgen Jepsen\n | Croatia 2–2 France (group B)Netherlands 3–0 Latvia (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Mike Riley | Philip SharpGlenn Turner\n | Sweden 5–0 Bulgaria (group C)Latvia 0–0 Germany (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Gilles Veissière | Frédéric ArnaultSerge Vallin\n | Russia 2–1 Greece (group A)Czech Republic 2–1 Latvia (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany | Markus Merk | Christian SchräerJan-Hendrik Salver\n | France 2–1 England (group B)Denmark 2–2 Sweden (group C)Portugal 0–1 Greece (Final)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Pierluigi Collina | Marco IvaldiNarciso Pisacreta\n | Portugal 1–2 Greece (group A)Croatia 2–4 England (group B)Greece 1–0 Czech Republic (semi-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | Terje Hauge | Ole Hermann BorganSteinar Holvik\n | Russia 0–2 Portugal (group A)Germany 1–2 Czech Republic (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Lucílio Batista | José CardinalPaulo Januário\n | Switzerland 0–0 Croatia (group B)Bulgaria 0–2 Denmark (group C)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia | Valentin Ivanov | ~~Gennady Krasyuk~~Vladimir Eniutin![Belarus](image) Yuri Dupanov\n | England 3–0 Switzerland (group B)Italy 2–1 Bulgaria (group C)Czech Republic 3–0 Denmark (quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia | Ľuboš Micheľ | Igor ŠramkaMartin Balko\n | Greece 1–1 Spain (group A)Switzerland 1–3 France (group B)Sweden 0–0 Netherlands (quarter-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Manuel Mejuto González | Oscar Martínez SamaniegoRafael Guerrero Alonso\n | Denmark 0–0 Italy (group C)Netherlands 2–3 Czech Republic (group D)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Anders Frisk | Kenneth PeterssonPeter Ekström\n | Spain 0–1 Portugal (group A)Germany 1–1 Netherlands (group D)France 0–1 Greece (quarter-final)Portugal 2–1 Netherlands (semi-final)\n |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Urs Meier | Francesco BuraginaRudolf Käppeli\n | Spain 1–0 Russia (group A)Italy 1–1 Sweden (group C)Portugal 2–2 England (quarter-final)\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth official\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Frank De Bleeckere |\n| ![](image) Greece | Kyros Vassaras |\n| ![](image) Luxembourg | Alain Hamer |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Stuart Dougal |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2004 finalists and their result\nUEFA announced the match schedule for the final tournament on 10 March 2003, in Porto, Portugal. In a change from the previous tournament schedule, where two quarter-final matches were played per day, over two days, the quarter-finals at the Euro 2004 were to be played over four consecutive days, with one match per day.[65][66]\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:[67][68]\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question;\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question;\n4. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n5. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n6. If on the last round of the group stage, two teams are facing each other and each has the same number of points, as well as the same number of goals scored and conceded, and the score finishes level in their match, their ranking is determined by a penalty shoot-out. (This criterion is not used if more than two teams have the same number of points.);\n7. Higher coefficient derived from 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying and UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying (points obtained divided by number of matches played);\n8. Fair play conduct of the team in the final tournament;\n9. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nEuro 2004 marked the introduction of the penalty shoot-out as a tiebreaker between two teams in the group stage, although no match required the use of this procedure. The same procedure was used in future European Championship tournaments.\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Portugal (H) | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 4\n | 2\n | +2\n | 6\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Greece | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n | 4\n | 0\n | 4[a] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Spain | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 0\n | 4[a] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Russia | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | −2\n | 3\n |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Greece 1–1 Spain) and overall goal difference (0).

There were three rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round, culminating in the final to decide the champions. Any game in the knockout stage that was not decided by the end of the regular 90 minutes was followed by up to 30 minutes of extra time (two 15-minute halves).\n\n\nFor the first time in an international football tournament, the silver goal system was applied, whereby the team that led the game at the half-time break during the extra time period would be declared the winner.[70] If the scores were still level after the initial 15 minutes of extra time, play would continue for a further 15 minutes. If the teams could still not be separated after the extra time, there would be a penalty shoot-out (at least five penalties each) to determine which team progressed to the next round.[70] The silver goal replaced the golden goal from the previous two championships and was used in the semi-final between Greece and the Czech Republic.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, WEST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Quarter-finals |  | Semi-finals |  | Final |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 24 June – Lisbon (Luz) |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | **![](image) Portugal (p)** | **2 (6)** |\n|  | 30 June – Lisbon (Alvalade) |\n|  | ![](image) England | 2 (5)\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Portugal** | **2** |\n|  | 26 June – Faro/Loulé |\n|  |  | ![](image) Netherlands | 1\n |  |\n|  | ![](image) Sweden | 0 (4) |\n|  |  | 4 July – Lisbon (Luz) |\n|  | **![](image) Netherlands (p)** | **0 (5)** |  |\n|  | ![](image) Portugal | 0 |\n|  | 25 June – Lisbon (Alvalade) |\n|  |  | **![](image) Greece** | **1** |\n|  | ![](image) France | 0 |\n|  | 1 July – Porto (Dragão) |  |\n|  | **![](image) Greece** | **1** |  |\n|  | **![](image) Greece (s.g.)** | **1** |\n|  | 27 June – Porto (Dragão) |\n|  |  | ![](image) Czech Republic | 0\n |  |\n|  | **![](image) Czech Republic** | **3** |\n|  |  |\n|  | ![](image) Denmark | 0\n |  |\n|  |\n\n\n### Quarter-finals[edit]\n\n\n24 June 2004 (2004-06-24)\n19:45\n\n\n| Portugal ![](image) | 2–2 (a.e.t.) | ![](image) England |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Postiga ![](image) 83'\n* Rui Costa ![](image) 110'\n | Report | * Owen ![](image) 3'\n* Lampard ![](image) 115'\n |\n| Penalties |\n| * Deco ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Simão ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Rui Costa ![soccer ball with red X](image)\n* Ronaldo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Maniche ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Postiga ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n* Ricardo ![soccer ball with check mark](image)\n | 6–5 | * ![soccer ball with red X](image) Beckham\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Owen\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Lampard\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Terry\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) Hargreaves\n* ![soccer ball with check mark](image) A.

Michael Ballack and Gianluca Zambrotta were the only players to be included whose teams were knocked out in the group stage.[74][75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Theodoros Zagorakis, UEFA Player of the Tournament\n\n\n| Goalkeepers\n | Defenders\n | Midfielders\n | Forwards\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Czech Republic](image) Petr Čech![Greece](image) Antonios Nikopolidis | ![England](image) Sol Campbell![England](image) Ashley Cole![Greece](image) Traianos Dellas![Greece](image) Giourkas Seitaridis![Italy](image) Gianluca Zambrotta![Portugal](image) Ricardo Carvalho![Sweden](image) Olof Mellberg | ![Czech Republic](image) Pavel Nedvěd![England](image) Frank Lampard![France](image) Zinedine Zidane![Germany](image) Michael Ballack![Greece](image) Theodoros Zagorakis![Portugal](image) Luís Figo![Portugal](image) Maniche | ![Czech Republic](image) Milan Baroš![Denmark](image) Jon Dahl Tomasson![England](image) Wayne Rooney![Greece](image) Angelos Charisteas![Netherlands](image) Ruud van Nistelrooy![Portugal](image) Cristiano Ronaldo![Sweden](image) Henrik Larsson |\n\n\nGolden Boot\nThe Golden Boot was awarded to Milan Baroš, who scored all five of his goals in three group stage matches and in the quarter-finals against Denmark.\n\n\n\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Milan Baroš (5 goals)[76]\n\n\nUEFA Player of the Tournament\n* ![Greece](image) Theodoros Zagorakis[77]\n\n\n### Prize money[edit]\n\n\nOverall, CHF200 million was awarded to the 16 teams, a boost from the CHF120 million in the previous event.[78] Below is a complete list of the allocations:[79]\n\n\n\n* Prize for participating: CHF7.5 million\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performance:\n\n\n\n* Winner: CHF10 million\n* Runner-up: CHF6 million\n* Semi-finals: CHF4 million\n* Quarter-finals: CHF3 million\n* Group stage (per match):\n\t+ Win: CHF1 million\n\t+ Draw: CHF500,000\n\n\n### Discipline[edit]\n\n\nIf a player was shown a red card – whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red – he would become suspended from playing in his team's next match. A player would also become suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated would be cancelled once a team was eliminated from the tournament or reached the semi-finals. In extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA could choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension would be required.\n\n\nThe following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Player\n | Offence(s)\n | Suspension(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Russia](image) Roman Sharonov | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group A v Spain | Group A v Portugal |\n| ![Greece](image) Giorgos Karagounis | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Portugal![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Spain | Group A v Russia |\n| ![Yellow card](image) in quarter-final v France![Yellow card](image) in semi-final v Czech Republic | Final v Portugal |\n| ![Greece](image) Zisis Vryzas | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Portugal![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia | Quarter-final v France |\n| ![Russia](image) Sergei Ovchinnikov | ![Red card](image) in Group A v Portugal | Group A v Greece |\n| ![Russia](image) Alexey Smertin | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Spain![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Portugal | Group A v Greece |\n| ![Spain](image) Carlos Marchena | ![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Russia![Yellow card](image) in Group A v Greece | Group A v Portugal |\n| ![Switzerland](image) Johann Vogel | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group B v Croatia | Group B v England |\n| ![Switzerland](image) Bernt Haas | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group B v England | Group B v France |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) Rosen Kirilov | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Sweden![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark | Group C v Italy |\n| ![Bulgaria](image) Stiliyan Petrov | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group C v Denmark | Group C v Italy |\n| ![Sweden](image) Tobias Linderoth | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Bulgaria![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Italy | Group C v Denmark |\n| ![Sweden](image) Erik Edman | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Italy![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark | Quarter-final v Netherlands |\n| ![Italy](image) Fabio Cannavaro | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Sweden | Group C v Bulgaria |\n| ![Italy](image) Gennaro Gattuso | ![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Denmark![Yellow card](image) in Group C v Sweden | Group C v Bulgaria |\n| ![Italy](image) Francesco Totti | Spat on Christian Poulsen in Group C v Denmark | Group C v SwedenGroup C v BulgariaWorld Cup qualifying v Norway |\n| ![Netherlands](image) John Heitinga | ![Yellow card](image) ![Yellow-red card](image) in Group D v Czech Republic | Group D v Latvia |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Logo, mascot and official song[edit]\n\n\n![](image)UEFA Euro 2004 mascot, Kinas\nThe official tournament logo was created by Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper agency and unveiled on 13 May 2002 at a ceremony held in Lisbon's Belém Cultural Center.[80] It represents a football in the centre of a heart, surrounded by seven green dots. The football – displaying typical Portuguese folk artistic motifs on its panels – and the heart – shaped in the traditional style of the filigree art from Viana do Castelo – conveyed the football passion of the host country. The seven dots represent significant Portuguese elements and achievements, such as the number of castles in the national coat of arms or the conquest of the seven seas during the Age of Discoveries. The logo's colour palette was based on the Portuguese flag and its warm tones recall the light and sun associated with the Portuguese landscape and climate.[81][82] The competition slogan used was \"Vive O 2004!\" (English: Live 2004!).[83][84]\n\n\nThe official mascot was a boy named Kinas – derived from *quinas* (English: inescutcheons), one of the symbols of the Portuguese coat of arms[85] – who wore a football kit with the Portuguese colours (red shirt and green shorts) and was constantly playing with a football. He possessed the knowledge and talent of generations of highly gifted football players, and embodied the energy and passion of football.[86] Created by Warner Bros., Kinas was officially unveiled on 29 March 2003 at the Casa de Serralves, in Porto, Portugal.[85]\n\n\nThe official song, called \"Força\" (English: Strength), was written and performed by Portuguese-Canadian singer Nelly Furtado.[87] The song was taken from her second studio album, *Folklore*, and released as its third single, soon after the start of the tournament. Furtado was selected to sing the official song of the tournament, because of her familial connection to the host country (her parents are both Portuguese from the Azores).[88] She wrote \"Força\" with \"the passion the Portuguese people have for football\" in mind.[88] The song was played at every match, and performed live by Furtado at the closing ceremony prior to the final.[89][90]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Roteiro\n\nThe official match ball was presented during the final draw ceremony on 30 November 2003 in Lisbon.[91][92] It was produced by Adidas and named Adidas Roteiro, after the logbook (Portuguese: *roteiro*) used by Portuguese maritime explorers such as Vasco da Gama.[91] Roteiro was the first official tournament football to employ the new thermal-bonding technique in its production, which resulted in a seamless surface and a more homogeneous design.[91] Portuguese Football Federation president Gilberto Madaíl praised the ball, stating: \"Adidas has delivered a stunning, modern and state-of the-art Portuguese football. This is very much how we envisage the UEFA Euro 2004 event to be\".[91] Roteiro was also used at the 2004 AFC Asian Cup,[93] and during the mid-season of the 2004–05 German Bundesliga.[94]\n\n\nThe new ball received mixed reactions from players and technical staffs. England midfielder David Beckham, who was asked by Adidas to test it, was pleased with Roteiro's performance, particularly in free-kicks.[91] France midfielder Zinedine Zidane believed the ball would \"improve the game\".[94] Several Spanish players, however, regarded it as \"horrible, difficult to control and to pass\", with Real Madrid footballer Iván Helguera describing it as a \"beach ball\".[95] Notable players of the Italy national team, such as Francesco Totti, Andrea Pirlo and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon also voiced criticisms.[96]\n\n\n\n### Trophy tour[edit]\n\n\nDuring the two months ahead of the tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy travelled across Portugal to promote the European Championship finals in the host country. The tour began on 8 April 2004 at the Praça do Comércio in Lisbon, where the launching ceremony took place with the presence of Portuguese football legend and tournament ambassador Eusébio.[97] A total of twenty towns and cities were visited by the trophy tour caravan, including the ten that would host matches.[98]\n\n\n\n\n\nTrophy tour stops and dates\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Lisbon (8–11 April)\n* Setúbal (10–14 April)\n* Faro/Loulé (15–18 April)\n* Beja (20–22 April)\n* Évora (23–25 April)\n | * Portalegre (27–29 April)\n* Santarém (30 April–2 May)\n* Leiria (4–6 May)\n* Castelo Branco (7–8 May)\n* Coimbra (10–13 May)\n | * Aveiro (13–15 May)\n* Guarda (16–17 May)\n* Viseu (18–19 May)\n* Bragança (21–23 May)\n* Vila Real (24–25 May)\n | * Viana do Castelo (27–28 May)\n* Guimarães (29 May – 1 June)\n* Braga (2–4 June)\n* Porto (6–11 June)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n### Merchandise and memorabilia[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2002, UEFA appointed Warner Bros. Consumer Products (WBCP) as the tournament's exclusive worldwide licensing agent.[99] As the global licensing rights owner, WBCP was responsible for negotiating product licence contracts with third parties on the behalf of UEFA and delineate product sales strategies across the host country. Other tasks included setting up and managing marketing plans, product distribution and prices, and prevent illegal use of trademarks and product sales.[100] Over 2,000 merchandise items were developed by the 28 licencees chosen by WBCP, and were distributed not only within Portugal but also in major European and Asian markets.[101]\n\n\nTo celebrate Portugal's hosting of the Euro 2004 finals, commemorative coin and stamp collections were issued by the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda, the Portuguese national mint and printing house,[102] and CTT, the national postal service.[103]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA distinguishes between global sponsors and national sponsors. Global Euro sponsors can come from any country and have together exclusive worldwide sponsorship rights for a UEFA European Football Championship. National sponsors come from the host country and do only have sponsorship rights within that country.[104] Eight sponsors were announced by UEFA in December 2002.[105]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global sponsors\n | National sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[106]\n* BenQ[107]\n* Canon[108]\n* Carlsberg[109]\n* Coca-Cola[110]\n* Hyundai[111]\n | * JVC[112]\n* MasterCard[113]\n* McDonald's[114]\n* NTT/Verio[115]\n* PT[116]\n* T-Mobile[117]\n\n\n |\n | * BPI[118]\n* CTT[119]\n* Galp Energia[120]\n* Portucel Soporcel[121]\n* Vista Alegre Atlantis Group[122]\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2004 broadcasting rights\n\nNineteen cameras were used in each of the ten venues to broadcast the live matches, with three additional cameras in the opening and knockout stage matches.[123][124]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Vive O 2004!*, the official album for UEFA Euro 2004\n* *UEFA Euro 2004*, the official video game for UEFA Euro 2004\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Euro Championships lowdown\".

Spain and Austria also bid to host the event.[2] The finals tournament was contested by 16 nations; with the exception of the hosts, Belgium and the Netherlands, the finalists had to go through a qualifying tournament to reach the final stage. France won the tournament by defeating Italy 2–1 in the final, via a golden goal.[3]\n\n\nThe finals saw the first major UEFA competition contested in the King Baudouin Stadium (formerly the Heysel Stadium) since the events of the 1985 European Cup final and the Heysel Stadium disaster, with the opening game being played in the rebuilt stadium.\n\n\nA high-scoring tournament with many exciting matches and a very high standard of play, Euro 2000 is often named by football writers as one of the greatest international tournaments ever.[4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands were selected as co-hosts on 14 July 1995 by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.[8][9]\n\n\n\n### Hooliganism concerns[edit]\n\n\nFootball hooliganism was a significant problem in the Netherlands in the 1990s, especially the fierce rivalry between Ajax and Feyenoord. There were concerns that hooliganism would overshadow the finals. Many instances of violence occurred, including several football riots in Rotterdam between 1995 and 1999, which would host the Euro 2000 final. One of the most infamous incidents was the Battle of Beverwijk in 1997. Although the violence is normally associated with domestic clubs, there were concerns that it could attach to the Dutch national team.[10][11]\n\n\nViolence did eventually occur during the Euro 2000 finals, albeit not involving the Dutch team. On 17 June 174 England fans were arrested in Brussels, Belgium, following violence with Germans ahead of an England v Germany match.[12]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nOne of the biggest surprises of the tournament was Portugal, winning Group A with three wins, including a 3–0 win against Germany, with Sérgio Conceição scoring a hat-trick,[13] and a 3–2 win over England, in which they came back from 2–0 down.[14] Romania was the other qualifier from the group, beating England with a late penalty in their last group game.[15]\n\n\nBelgium had a surprise exit in the group stage, winning the tournament's first game against Sweden,[16] but losing to Turkey and Italy.[17][18] They finished third in Group B, behind Italy and Turkey. The other co-host and favourite, the Netherlands, progressed as expected from Group D, along with World Cup winners France. The Netherlands won the group, by beating France in their last group match.[19] Also in Group D, Denmark's three losses with eight goals conceded and none scored set a new record for the worst team performance in the group stages of a Euros. Group C was memorable for the match between FR Yugoslavia and Spain. Spain needed a win to ensure progression, but found themselves trailing 3–2 after Slobodan Komljenović scored in the 75th minute. The Spanish side rescued their tournament by scoring twice in injury time to record a 4–3 victory.[20] FR Yugoslavia managed to go through as well, despite losing because Norway and Slovenia played to a draw.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)France and Italy before the final on 2 July\nItaly and Portugal maintained their perfect records in the quarter-finals, beating Romania and Turkey, respectively, and the Netherlands started a goal-avalanche against FR Yugoslavia, winning 6–1. Spain fell 2–1 to France; Raúl missed a late penalty that ended Spanish hopes.\n\n\nItaly eliminated the Netherlands in the semi-finals, despite going down to ten men and facing two penalty kicks. Italian goalkeeper Francesco Toldo, who had been drafted into the starting XI as Gianluigi Buffon missed the tournament through injury, made two saves in the penalty shootout (in addition to his penalty save in normal time) to carry the Italians to the final.\n\n\nIn the other semi-final, Portugal lost in extra time to France after Zinedine Zidane converted a controversial penalty kick. Several Portuguese players challenged the awarding of the penalty for a handball and were given lengthy suspensions for shoving the referee.[22] France won the tournament, defeating Italy 2–1 in the final with a golden goal by David Trezeguet after equalising with a last-minute goal, and became the first team to win the European championship while being world champion.[23]\n\n\nIn Britain, *Match of the Day* named Stefano Fiore's goal against Belgium the Goal of the Tournament, ahead of Patrick Kluivert's against France and Zinedine Zidane's against Spain.[24]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nationale-Nederlanden building in Rotterdam with \"breakthrough\" featuring Edgar Davids\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying\n\nQualification for the tournament took place throughout 1998 and 1999. Forty-nine teams were divided into nine groups and each played the others in their group, on a home-and-away basis. The winner of each group and the best runner-up qualified automatically for the final tournament. The eight other runners-up played an additional set of play-off matches to determine the last four qualifiers. Belgium and the Netherlands automatically qualified for the tournament as co-hosts.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time Serbia (then FR Yugoslavia) qualified for the European Championship finals, the only time that Norway and Slovenia qualified, as well as the last time that Croatia failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Co-host | 14 July 1995 | 3 (*1972*, 1980, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 5 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 9 winner | 9 June 1999 | 4 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | Group 2 winner | 8 September 1999 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 5 winner | 8 September 1999 | 1 (*1992*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 6 winner | 8 September 1999 | 5 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 1 winner | 9 October 1999 | 4 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 3 winner | 9 October 1999 | 7 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 4 winner | 9 October 1999 | 4 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 7 winner | 9 October 1999 | 2 (1984, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia[D] | Group 8 winner | 9 October 1999 | 4 (1960, 1968, *1976*, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Best runner-up | 9 October 1999 | 2 (1984, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 5 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 5 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 1 (1996)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1984, FR Yugoslavia competed as Yugoslavia.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe finals draw took place 15:00 CET on 12 December 1999, at the Brussels Expo in Belgium; and was streamed live on UEFA's official website.[25]\n\n\nThe composition of pots 1 to 4 was based on the teams' UEFA national team coefficient ranking at the end of 1999,[26] with the exception of pot 1 automatically top seeding Germany as holders along with co-hosts Belgium and Netherlands.[27][28][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany (holders)[a] | 2.278 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium (co-hosts)[b] | 2.375 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands (co-hosts)[c] | 2.250 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Spain[d] | 2.611 | 1\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Romania | 2.600 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | 2.500 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2.389 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 2.300 | 6\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) FR Yugoslavia | 2.222 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 2.100 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2.100 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2.063 | 13\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | 2.000 | 15\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 1.938 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 1.938 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | 1.000 | 37\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespectively of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Defending champions Germany (coefficient 2.278; rank 7th) were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Co-hosts Belgium (coefficient 2.375; rank 5th) were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Co-hosts Netherlands (coefficient 2.250; rank 8th) were automatically assigned to position D1.\n4. **^** Highest ranked Spain (coefficient 2.611; rank 1st) were automatically assigned to position C1.\n\nPrior to the draw, the seeded teams in Pot 1 were assigned positions: Germany (defending champion) to A1, Belgium (co-host) to B1, Spain (highest coefficient) to C1, and the Netherlands (co-host) to D1.

officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 February 2000, UEFA appointed 12 referees, 16 assistant referees and four fourth officials for the competition, including a referee and an assistant referee from the Confederation of African Football.[52] The event saw assistant referees being allowed to intervene an ongoing game, in particular to help the match official apply the 10-metre rule when deciding free-kicks – as well as warn the referee instantly if he had booked or ejected the wrong player, something that was not possible in previous tournaments.[53] Also, fourth officials were given a larger role in assisting to take command of the match if any decisions are gone unnoticed by the referee or an assistant referee.[53]\n\n\nThe German referee Markus Merk was selected to referee the opening game between Belgium and Sweden.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Referees\n | Assistant referees\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Austria](image) Günter Benkö | ![Belarus](image) Yuri Dupanov\n |

Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:[55]\n\n\n\n1. greater

question;\n4. greater goal difference in all group games;\n5. greater number of goals scored in all group games;\n6. higher coefficient derived from Euro 2000 and 1998 World Cup qualifiers (points obtained divided by number of matches played);\n7. fair play conduct in Euro 2000;\n8. drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2000 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team*

article: UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage\n\nThe knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament with each round eliminating the losers.[55] Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time.[55] For the second time the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner.[55] If no goal was scored there would be a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner.[55] For the second time the final was won by a golden goal.[55]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |

million was awarded to the 16 qualified teams in the competition.[59][60] France, the winners of the tournament, received a total prize money of CHF14.4 million.[59] Below is a complete list of the allocations:[60]\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\n\n\n* Winner: CHF14.4 million\n* Runner-up: CHF13.2 million\n* Semi-finals: CHF10.2 million\n* Quarter-finals: CHF7.8 million\n* Group stage:\n\t+ Third place: CHF5.4 million\n\t+ Fourth place: CHF4.8 million\n\n\nOn 9 July 2000, UEFA refused to hand FR Yugoslavia their prize money of CHF7.8 million, because of alleged ties between the Football Association of FR Yugoslavia and Slobodan Milošević's government.[61] However, no connections were found and the Football Association of FR Yugoslavia later received their money with an additional bonus.[62]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Slogan and theme song[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Euro 2000: The Official Album\n\nThe slogan of the competition was \"Football without frontiers\".[63][64] \"Campione 2000\" by E-Type was the official anthem of the event.[65]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Adidas Terrestra Silverstream, the match ball used at the tournament.\nThe Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was unveiled as the official match ball of the competition on 13 December 1999 at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, Anderlecht's home arena by Alessandro Del Piero, Edwin van der Sar, Zinedine Zidane and Luc Nilis.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benelucky, the Euro 2000 mascot\nThe official mascot for the tournament was *Benelucky*[68] (a pun on Benelux), a lion-devil hybrid with its mane having the flag colours of both host nations. The lion is the national football emblem of the Netherlands and a devil is the emblem of Belgium (the team being nicknamed \"the Red Devils\").[69]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA distinguishes between global sponsors and national sponsors. Global Euro sponsors can come from any country and have exclusive worldwide sponsorship rights for a UEFA Euro championship. National (event) sponsors come from a host country and only have sponsorship rights within that country.[70]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global sponsors | Event sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Belgium\n | Netherlands\n |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[71]\n* Adecco[71]\n* Carlsberg[72]\n* Cisco Systems[71]\n* Coca-Cola[72]\n* Fujifilm[72]\n | * Hyundai[72]\n* JVC[72]\n* MasterCard[72]\n* McDonald's[72]\n* Nestlé Cereals[71]\n* Philips[72]\n | * PlayStation[72]\n* Pringles[72]\n* PSINet[72][73]\n* Sportal[72]\n* Total Fina[71]\n* Unilever[74]\n\n\n |\n |  | * Connexxion[71]\n* KLM[71]\n* Lever Fabergé[71]\n* Telfort[71][73]\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2000 broadcasting rights\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nielsen suffered an injury in the 39th minute and was replaced by fourth official Günter Benkö (Austria).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Policing Euro 2000\" (PDF). *Police Academy of the Netherlands*.

Spain and Austria also bid to host the event.[2] The finals tournament was contested by 16 nations; with the exception of the hosts, Belgium and the Netherlands, the finalists had to go through a qualifying tournament to reach the final stage. France won the tournament by defeating Italy 2–1 in the final, via a golden goal.[3]\n\n\nThe finals saw the first major UEFA competition contested in the King Baudouin Stadium (formerly the Heysel Stadium) since the events of the 1985 European Cup final and the Heysel Stadium disaster, with the opening game being played in the rebuilt stadium.\n\n\nA high-scoring tournament with many exciting matches and a very high standard of play, Euro 2000 is often named by football writers as one of the greatest international tournaments ever.[4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands were selected as co-hosts on 14 July 1995 by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.[8][9]\n\n\n\n### Hooliganism concerns[edit]\n\n\nFootball hooliganism was a significant problem in the Netherlands in the 1990s, especially the fierce rivalry between Ajax and Feyenoord. There were concerns that hooliganism would overshadow the finals. Many instances of violence occurred, including several football riots in Rotterdam between 1995 and 1999, which would host the Euro 2000 final. One of the most infamous incidents was the Battle of Beverwijk in 1997. Although the violence is normally associated with domestic clubs, there were concerns that it could attach to the Dutch national team.[10][11]\n\n\nViolence did eventually occur during the Euro 2000 finals, albeit not involving the Dutch team. On 17 June 174 England fans were arrested in Brussels, Belgium, following violence with Germans ahead of an England v Germany match.[12]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nOne of the biggest surprises of the tournament was Portugal, winning Group A with three wins, including a 3–0 win against Germany, with Sérgio Conceição scoring a hat-trick,[13] and a 3–2 win over England, in which they came back from 2–0 down.[14] Romania was the other qualifier from the group, beating England with a late penalty in their last group game.[15]\n\n\nBelgium had a surprise exit in the group stage, winning the tournament's first game against Sweden,[16] but losing to Turkey and Italy.[17][18] They finished third in Group B, behind Italy and Turkey. The other co-host and favourite, the Netherlands, progressed as expected from Group D, along with World Cup winners France. The Netherlands won the group, by beating France in their last group match.[19] Also in Group D, Denmark's three losses with eight goals conceded and none scored set a new record for the worst team performance in the group stages of a Euros. Group C was memorable for the match between FR Yugoslavia and Spain. Spain needed a win to ensure progression, but found themselves trailing 3–2 after Slobodan Komljenović scored in the 75th minute. The Spanish side rescued their tournament by scoring twice in injury time to record a 4–3 victory.[20] FR Yugoslavia managed to go through as well, despite losing because Norway and Slovenia played to a draw.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)France and Italy before the final on 2 July\nItaly and Portugal maintained their perfect records in the quarter-finals, beating Romania and Turkey, respectively, and the Netherlands started a goal-avalanche against FR Yugoslavia, winning 6–1. Spain fell 2–1 to France; Raúl missed a late penalty that ended Spanish hopes.\n\n\nItaly eliminated the Netherlands in the semi-finals, despite going down to ten men and facing two penalty kicks. Italian goalkeeper Francesco Toldo, who had been drafted into the starting XI as Gianluigi Buffon missed the tournament through injury, made two saves in the penalty shootout (in addition to his penalty save in normal time) to carry the Italians to the final.\n\n\nIn the other semi-final, Portugal lost in extra time to France after Zinedine Zidane converted a controversial penalty kick. Several Portuguese players challenged the awarding of the penalty for a handball and were given lengthy suspensions for shoving the referee.[22] France won the tournament, defeating Italy 2–1 in the final with a golden goal by David Trezeguet after equalising with a last-minute goal, and became the first team to win the European championship while being world champion.[23]\n\n\nIn Britain, *Match of the Day* named Stefano Fiore's goal against Belgium the Goal of the Tournament, ahead of Patrick Kluivert's against France and Zinedine Zidane's against Spain.[24]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nationale-Nederlanden building in Rotterdam with \"breakthrough\" featuring Edgar Davids\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying\n\nQualification for the tournament took place throughout 1998 and 1999. Forty-nine teams were divided into nine groups and each played the others in their group, on a home-and-away basis. The winner of each group and the best runner-up qualified automatically for the final tournament. The eight other runners-up played an additional set of play-off matches to determine the last four qualifiers. Belgium and the Netherlands automatically qualified for the tournament as co-hosts.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time Serbia (then FR Yugoslavia) qualified for the European Championship finals, the only time that Norway and Slovenia qualified, as well as the last time that Croatia failed to qualify.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Co-host | 14 July 1995 | 3 (*1972*, 1980, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 5 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[B] | Group 9 winner | 9 June 1999 | 4 (1960, **1976**, 1980, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | Group 2 winner | 8 September 1999 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Group 5 winner | 8 September 1999 | 1 (*1992*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 6 winner | 8 September 1999 | 5 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 1 winner | 9 October 1999 | 4 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 3 winner | 9 October 1999 | 7 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992, **1996**)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 4 winner | 9 October 1999 | 4 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 7 winner | 9 October 1999 | 2 (1984, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia[D] | Group 8 winner | 9 October 1999 | 4 (1960, 1968, *1976*, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Best runner-up | 9 October 1999 | 2 (1984, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 5 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**, 1996)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 5 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992, *1996*)\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Play-off winner | 17 November 1999 | 1 (1996)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1984, FR Yugoslavia competed as Yugoslavia.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe finals draw took place 15:00 CET on 12 December 1999, at the Brussels Expo in Belgium; and was streamed live on UEFA's official website.[25]\n\n\nThe composition of pots 1 to 4 was based on the teams' UEFA national team coefficient ranking at the end of 1999,[26] with the exception of pot 1 automatically top seeding Germany as holders along with co-hosts Belgium and Netherlands.[27][28][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nPot 1\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany (holders)[a] | 2.278 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium (co-hosts)[b] | 2.375 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands (co-hosts)[c] | 2.250 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Spain[d] | 2.611 | 1\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 2\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Romania | 2.600 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Norway | 2.500 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Sweden | 2.389 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | 2.300 | 6\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 3\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) FR Yugoslavia | 2.222 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 2.100 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2.100 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2.063 | 13\n |\n\n | \n\nPot 4\n| Team | Coeff | Rank |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | 2.000 | 15\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 1.938 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 1.938 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia | 1.000 | 37\n |\n\n |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespectively of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Defending champions Germany (coefficient 2.278; rank 7th) were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Co-hosts Belgium (coefficient 2.375; rank 5th) were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Co-hosts Netherlands (coefficient 2.250; rank 8th) were automatically assigned to position D1.\n4. **^** Highest ranked Spain (coefficient 2.611; rank 1st) were automatically assigned to position C1.\n\nPrior to the draw, the seeded teams in Pot 1 were assigned positions: Germany (defending champion) to A1, Belgium (co-host) to B1, Spain (highest coefficient) to C1, and the Netherlands (co-host) to D1.

officials[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 February 2000, UEFA appointed 12 referees, 16 assistant referees and four fourth officials for the competition, including a referee and an assistant referee from the Confederation of African Football.[52] The event saw assistant referees being allowed to intervene an ongoing game, in particular to help the match official apply the 10-metre rule when deciding free-kicks – as well as warn the referee instantly if he had booked or ejected the wrong player, something that was not possible in previous tournaments.[53] Also, fourth officials were given a larger role in assisting to take command of the match if any decisions are gone unnoticed by the referee or an assistant referee.[53]\n\n\nThe German referee Markus Merk was selected to referee the opening game between Belgium and Sweden.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Referees\n | Assistant referees\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Austria](image) Günter Benkö | ![Belarus](image) Yuri Dupanov\n |

Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:[55]\n\n\n\n1. greater number of points in the matches between the teams in question;\n2. greater goal difference in matches between the teams in question;\n3. greater number of goals scored in matches between the teams in question;\n4. greater goal difference in all group games;\n5. greater number of goals scored in all group games;\n6. higher coefficient derived from Euro 2000 and 1998 World Cup qualifiers (points obtained divided by number of matches played);\n7. fair play conduct in Euro 2000;\n8. drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2000 Group A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team*

article: UEFA Euro 2000 knockout stage\n\nThe knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament with each round eliminating the losers.[55] Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time.[55] For the second time the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner.[55] If no goal was scored there would be a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner.[55] For the second time the final was won by a golden goal.[55]\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Bracket[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |

million was awarded to the 16 qualified teams in the competition.[59][60] France, the winners of the tournament, received a total prize money of CHF14.4 million.[59] Below is a complete list of the allocations:[60]\n\n\nExtra payment based on teams performances:\n\n\n\n* Winner: CHF14.4 million\n* Runner-up: CHF13.2 million\n* Semi-finals: CHF10.2 million\n* Quarter-finals: CHF7.8 million\n* Group stage:\n\t+ Third place: CHF5.4 million\n\t+ Fourth place: CHF4.8 million\n\n\nOn 9 July 2000, UEFA refused to hand FR Yugoslavia their prize money of CHF7.8 million, because of alleged ties between the Football Association of FR Yugoslavia and Slobodan Milošević's government.[61] However, no connections were found and the Football Association of FR Yugoslavia later received their money with an additional bonus.[62]\n\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Slogan and theme song[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Euro 2000: The Official Album\n\nThe slogan of the competition was \"Football without frontiers\".[63][64] \"Campione 2000\" by E-Type was the official anthem of the event.[65]\n\n\n\n### Match ball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Adidas Terrestra Silverstream, the match ball used at the tournament.\nThe Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was unveiled as the official match ball of the competition on 13 December 1999 at Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, Anderlecht's home arena by Alessandro Del Piero, Edwin van der Sar, Zinedine Zidane and Luc Nilis.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benelucky, the Euro 2000 mascot\nThe official mascot for the tournament was *Benelucky*[68] (a pun on Benelux), a lion-devil hybrid with its mane having the flag colours of both host nations. The lion is the national football emblem of the Netherlands and a devil is the emblem of Belgium (the team being nicknamed \"the Red Devils\").[69]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nUEFA distinguishes between global sponsors and national sponsors. Global Euro sponsors can come from any country and have exclusive worldwide sponsorship rights for a UEFA Euro championship. National (event) sponsors come from a host country and only have sponsorship rights within that country.[70]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global sponsors | Event sponsors\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Belgium\n | Netherlands\n |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Adidas[71]\n* Adecco[71]\n* Carlsberg[72]\n* Cisco Systems[71]\n* Coca-Cola[72]\n* Fujifilm[72]\n | * Hyundai[72]\n* JVC[72]\n* MasterCard[72]\n* McDonald's[72]\n* Nestlé Cereals[71]\n* Philips[72]\n | * PlayStation[72]\n* Pringles[72]\n* PSINet[72][73]\n* Sportal[72]\n* Total Fina[71]\n* Unilever[74]\n\n\n |\n |  | * Connexxion[71]\n* KLM[71]\n* Lever Fabergé[71]\n* Telfort[71][73]\n |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 2000 broadcasting rights\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nielsen suffered an injury in the 39th minute and was replaced by fourth official Günter Benkö (Austria).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Policing Euro 2000\" (PDF). *Police Academy of the Netherlands*.

It took place in England from 8 to 30 June 1996. It was the first European Championship to feature 16 finalists, following UEFA's decision to expand the tournament from eight teams.\n\n\nMatches were staged in eight cities and, although not all games were sold out, the tournament holds the European Championship's second-highest aggregate attendance (1,276,000) and average per game (41,158) for the 16-team format,[1] surpassed only in 2012.[2]\n\n\nThe tournament was the first European Championship where three points were awarded for a win during the qualification and finals group stages, as opposed to the old system of two points for a win, reflecting the growing use of this system in domestic leagues throughout the world during the previous decade.\n\n\nGermany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany's first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required.[3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.[4]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992.[5] In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.[5]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick.[6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands.[7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on tie-breaking criteria.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Group A game between Scotland and the Netherlands at Villa Park\nGroup B had Western European France and Spain, along with Balkan World Cup participants Romania and Bulgaria. France and Spain dominated the group,[9][10] with France avenging Bulgaria for the 1994 qualification debacle,[11] and World Cup quarter-finalists Romania going home,[12] with no points and only one goal scored.\n\n\nGroups C and D saw the Czech Republic and Croatia, whose national teams had only recently come into existence, qualify for the knockout stage. The Czechs lost to Germany, the eventual group winners, in their opener, but then defeated Italy and drew with Russia.[13][14] Italy's defeat meant they had to beat Germany in their final game to progress, but the World Cup finalists could only manage a 0–0 draw and were eliminated.[15] In Group D, Croatia qualified for the quarter-finals, with wins over Turkey (1–0) and Denmark (3–0).[16] The loss to the Croats ultimately sent the Danes, the surprise champions of 1992, home. Turkey became the first team since the introduction of a group stage to be eliminated without gaining a point or scoring a goal.\n\n\nThe other three quarter-finalists were Portugal (whose \"Golden Generation\" was competing at its first major tournament), Spain, and a France team featuring a young Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n### Quarter-finals and semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe knockout stage was characterised by negative, defensive play; as a result, only nine goals were scored in the seven games and four of the matches were decided on penalties. The first quarter-final between the hosts and Spain ended goalless, after Spain had two goals disallowed and two claims for a penalty denied.[17] The English progressed 4–2 on spot kicks.[18] France and Netherlands also played out a 0–0 draw, with France winning the penalty shootout 5–4.[19] Jürgen Klinsmann opened the scoring for Germany in their match against Croatia. A goal from Davor Šuker evened the score after 51 minutes, before Matthias Sammer of Germany scored eight minutes later, and the game ended 2–1 to Germany.[20] Czech Republic progressed after beating Portugal 1–0.[21][22]\n\n\n\n![](image)The view of Wembley Stadium from Wembley Way before the semi-final between Germany and England\nThe first semi-final, featuring France and Czech Republic, resulted in another 0–0 draw and penalties. Reynald Pedros was the one player to miss in the shootout, as Czech Republic won the penalty shoot-out 6–5.[23] The other semi-final was a repeat of the 1990 World Cup semi-final between Germany and England. Alan Shearer headed in after three minutes to give his side the lead, but Stefan Kuntz evened the score less than 15 minutes later, and the score remained 1–1 after 90 minutes. In extra time, Paul Gascoigne came very close to scoring a golden goal, but fractionally missed a cross from Shearer in front of the empty goal, Darren Anderton hit the post, and Kuntz had a goal disallowed for pushing. Neither team was able to find a second goal. In penalties, both sides scored their first five kicks, but in the sixth round, Gareth Southgate had his penalty saved, allowing Andreas Möller to score the winning goal.[24]\n\n\n\n### Final match[edit]\n\n\nThe final saw the Czech Republic hoping to repeat Euro 1976 when Czechoslovakia defeated West Germany; the Germans were aiming to win their third European Championship. Patrik Berger scored from a penalty in 59th minute to put the Czechs ahead. German substitute Oliver Bierhoff scored in the 73rd minute to make it 1–1. Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff's shot was mishandled by Czech goalkeeper Kouba and the ball ended up in the back of the net for the first golden goal in the history of the competition.[25] Germany were European champions again, but for the first time as a unified country.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying\n\nOn 30 November 1992, UEFA formally decided to expand the tournament to sixteen teams.[26] UEFA cited the increased number of international teams following the recent break up of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia – rising from 33 UEFA members in 1988 to 48 by 1994 – as a driving factor behind the expansion.[27] Forty-seven teams ultimately entered to compete for the fifteen remaining places in the finals, alongside hosts England.[28]\n\n\nThe draw for the qualifying competition took place in Manchester on 22 January 1994.[29] The teams were divided into eight groups, each containing either six or five teams. The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nWith the extended format, three teams were able to qualify for their first European Championship: Bulgaria, Switzerland and Turkey. Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that Sweden failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | Host | 5 May 1992 | 4 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 2 winner | 11 October 1995 | 4 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[B] | Group 8 winner | 11 October 1995 | 6 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group 3 winner | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group 4 winner | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | 4th best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 1 (1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | 2nd best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 7 winner | 15 November 1995 | 6 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 1 winner | 15 November 1995 | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 3rd best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 5th best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 4 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[D] | Group 5 winner | 15 November 1995 | 3 (1960, **1976**, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 1st best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 3 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) France | 6th best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 3 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 6 winner | 15 November 1995 | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Play-off winner | 13 December 1995 | 4 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 December 1995 at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham.[30] Only four teams were seeded: England (as hosts), Denmark (as holders), Spain and Germany (as the two highest ranked teams). The remaining twelve teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group.[30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England (hosts)[a] | ![](image) Bulgaria | ![](image) Italy | ![](image) Russia |\n| ![](image) Denmark (holders)[b] | ![](image) Croatia | ![](image) Netherlands | ![](image) Scotland |\n| ![](image) Germany | ![](image) Czech Republic | ![](image) Portugal | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| ![](image) Spain | ![](image) France | ![](image) Romania | ![](image) Turkey |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Hosts England were automatically assigned to group position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions Denmark were automatically assigned to Pot 1, and could be drawn into group position B1, C1 or D1.\n\n**Draw procedure:**[30]\n\n\n\n1. The unseeded teams were first drawn one by one without being revealed from Pot 2, and placed consecutively into four group bowls labelled I to IV. The teams drawn first, fifth and ninth were put into the Group I bowl; second, sixth and tenth were put into the Group II bowl; third, seventh and eleventh were put into the Group III bowl; and fourth, eighth and twelfth were put into the Group IV bowl.\n2. The team drawn first from each group bowl was placed into position 4 in their group; the team drawn second in position 3; and the team drawn third in position 2.\n3. Finally, the four top-seeded teams were drawn from the separate Pot 1 bowl, and placed consecutively into position 1 of each group bowl.\n4. While it was decreed in advance ahead of the draw, that England's group would be Group A (irrespective of their drawn group label), the remaining three groups then consecutively had the three remaining letters (B, C and D) drawn from yet another bowl to decide the letter name of their group, which also determined what venues they would play at.\n\n\nThe balls were drawn by UEFA figures Gerhard Aigner and Lennart Johansson.[30]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) England |\n| A2 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| A3 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| A4 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| Wembley and Villa Park\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| B2 | ![](image) Bulgaria |\n| B3 | ![](image) Romania |\n| B4 | ![](image) France |\n| Elland Road and St James Park\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| C2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| C3 | ![](image) Italy |\n| C4 | ![](image) Russia |\n| Old Trafford and Anfield\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| D2 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| D3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| D4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| Hillsborough and City Ground\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nSince the implementation of the Taylor Report in 1990, following the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, England now had enough all-seater stadia of sufficient capacity to hold an expanded tournament due to the necessary stadium refurbishment by its leading clubs. The stadium capacities listed in the table are for the time of the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 1996 is located in England](image)![London](image)\nLondon\n![Manchester](image)\nManchester\n![Liverpool](image)\nLiverpool\n![Birmingham](image)\nBirmingham\n![Leeds](image)\nLeeds\n![Sheffield](image)\nSheffield\n![Nottingham](image)\nNottingham\n![Newcastle](image)\nNewcastle\n | London | Manchester |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Wembley Stadium | Old Trafford |\n| Capacity: **76,567** | Capacity: **55,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Liverpool | Birmingham |\n| Anfield | Villa Park |\n| Capacity: **42,730** | Capacity: **40,310** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Leeds | Sheffield | Nottingham | Newcastle |\n| Elland Road | Hillsborough | City Ground | St James' Park |\n| Capacity: **40,204** | Capacity: **39,859** | Capacity: **30,539** | Capacity: **36,649** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1996 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 22 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers.\n\n\n\n## Finals format[edit]\n\n\nTo accommodate the expansion from an 8-team finals tournament to 16 teams, the format was changed from that used in 1992 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phases. The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Questra\n\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the *Questra Europa*, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.[32]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nMatch officials are listed in the two collapsed tables below.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistants\n | Fourth official\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Gerd Grabher | Egon Bereuter\n | Manfred Zeiszer\n | Günter Benkö | Netherlands 1–4 England |\n| ![](image) Belarus | Vadim Zhuk | Yuri Dupanov\n | Aleh Chykun\n | Kazimir Znaydinsky\n | France 1–1 Spain |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Guy Goethals | Marc Van den Broeck\n | Stany Op de Beeck\n | Michel Piraux | Italy 0–0 Germany |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Atanas Uzunov | Ivan Borissov Lekov\n | Iordan Iordanov\n | Stefan Ormandjiev\n | Switzerland 0–0 Netherlands |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Václav Krondl | Milan Brabec\n | Otakar Draštík\n | Jiří Ulrich\n | Scotland 1–0 Switzerland |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Peter Mikkelsen | Jens Larsen\n | Henning Knudsen\n | Knud Erik Fisker | Bulgaria 1–0 Romania |\n| Kim Milton Nielsen | Carl-Johan Christensen Meyer\n | Torben Siersen\n | Lars Gerner\n | Russia 0–3 Germany |\n| ![](image) England | David Elleray | Anthony Bates | Peter Walton | Stephen Lodge | Germany 2–0 Czech Republic |\n| Dermot Gallagher | Phil Joslin | Mark Warren | Paul Durkin | France 3–1 Bulgaria |\n| ![](image) France | Marc Batta | Pierre Ufrasi\n | Jacques Mas\n | Alain Sars | Croatia 3–0 DenmarkSpain 0–0 England (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Germany | Bernd Heynemann | Hans Wolf\n | Harald Sather\n | Hartmut Strampe | Croatia 0–3 Portugal |\n| Hellmut Krug | Klaus Plettenberg\n | Egbert Engler\n | Hermann Albrecht | Romania 0–1 FranceCzech Republic 1–0 Portugal |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Sándor Puhl | László Hamar\n | Imre Bozóky\n | Sándor Piller\n | Portugal 1–0 TurkeyGermany 1–1 England (Semi-final) |\n| ![](image) Italy | Piero Ceccarini | Enrico Preziosi\n | Fabrizio Zanforlin\n | Alfredo Trentalange | Spain 1–1 Bulgaria |\n| Pierluigi Pairetto | Donato Nicoletti\n | Tullio Manfredini\n | Marcello Nicchi\n | Scotland 0–2 EnglandCzech Republic 1–2 Germany (Final) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Mario van der Ende | Jan Dolstra\n | Berend Talens\n | René Temmink | Denmark 1–1 Portugal |\n| ![](image) Russia | Nikolai Levnikov | Serguei Foursa\n | Sergei Frantsuzov\n | Sergei Khusainov | Turkey 0–3 Denmark |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Leslie Mottram | Robert Orr\n | John Fleming\n | Hugh Dallas | Italy 2–1 RussiaFrance 0–0 Czech Republic (Semi-final) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Manuel Díaz Vega | Joaquín Olmos González\n | Fernando Tresaco Gracia\n | José María García-Aranda | England 1–1 Switzerland |\n| Antonio López Nieto | Victoriano Giráldez Carrasco\n | Manuel López Fernández\n | Juan Ansuátegui Roca\n | Czech Republic 2–1 ItalyFrance 0–0 Netherlands (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Anders Frisk | Mikael Nilsson\n | Sten Samuelsson\n | Morgan Norman\n | Russia 3–3 Czech Republic |\n| Leif Sundell | Kenneth Petersson\n | Mikael Hansson\n | Karl-Erik Nilsson | Netherlands 0–0 ScotlandGermany 2–1 Croatia (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Serge Muhmenthaler | Ernst Felder\n | Martin Freiburghaus\n | Urs Meier | Turkey 0–1 Croatia |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Ahmet Çakar | Akif Uğurdur\n | Turgay Güdü\n | Oğuz Sarvan | Romania 1–2 Spain |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Finishing positions of the participating teams\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progress to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament. For the first time at a European Championship three points were awarded for a win, with one for a draw and a none for a defeat.\n\n\n*All times are local, BST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the European Championship, the position of teams tied on points was decided by their head-to-head record, and not goal difference.[33] If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points);\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points);\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3 to more than two teams, two teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the two teams in question to determine the final rankings of the two teams. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 apply in the order given;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7. Position using UEFA's national team coefficient ranking system calculated using average points per game from: the Euro 1992 qualifying stage and final tournament, the 1994 World Cup qualifying stage and final tournament and the Euro 1996 qualifying stage.\n8. Fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament);\n9. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1996 Group A\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) England (H) | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 2\n | +5\n | 7\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Netherlands | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n | −1\n | 4[a] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Scotland | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | −1\n | 4[a] |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image)  Switzerland | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n | −3\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: UEFA  \n(H) Hosts  \nNotes:\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tied on head-to-head result (Netherlands 0–0 Scotland) and overall goal difference (−1).

Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time. For the first time in a major football competition, the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner. If no goal was scored there would be a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. For the first time the final was won by a golden goal.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, BST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n###

Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Slogan and theme songs[edit]\n\n\nThe competition slogan was **Football Comes Home** reflecting that the sport's rules were first standardised in the United Kingdom. UEFA President Lennart Johansson had said that the organisation had felt it was time to bring the event \"back to the motherland of football\".[29]\n\n\nThe slogan was incorporated into the competition's most popular song: \"Three Lions\" recorded by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with Britpop band the Lightning Seeds. Baddiel and Skinner were then strongly connected with football owing to their BBC show *Fantasy Football League*.[37] Released as a single, the song topped the UK Singles Chart for a total of two weeks.[38] It was promoted by a video featuring the England squad.[37]\n\n\nThe song was prominently sung by England fans during all their games, and was also chanted by the German team upon parading the trophy in Berlin after the tournament. It was even referenced by future Prime Minister Tony Blair in an address at the 1996 Labour Party Conference with the line: *\"Seventeen years of hurt, never stopped us dreaming, Labour's coming home\".*[39]\n\n\n\"Three Lions\" was the official song of the England team, and is the song most strongly connected with the tournament, however the official song of the tournament was \"We're in This Together\" by Simply Red. The song was performed at the tournament's opening ceremony.[40]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise and mascots[edit]\n\n\nThe British Royal Mint issued a commemorative £2 coin in 1996, which featured a representation of a football, \"1996\" in the centre, and 16 small rings representing the 16 competing teams. Further special coins were only issued in the Isle of Man and Gibraltar.[41]\n\n\nThe official mascot, 'Goaliath', was designed in a similar fashion to the original World Cup mascot from the 1966 World Cup. Goaliath comprised a lion, the image on the English team crest, dressed in an England football strip and football boots whilst holding a football under his right arm.[42]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Event sponsors\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Canon[43][44]\n* Carlsberg[43][44]\n* Coca-Cola[43][44]\n* Fujifilm[43][44]\n* JVC[43][44]\n* MasterCard[43][44]\n | * McDonald's[43][44]\n* Philips[43][44]\n* Snickers[43][44]\n* Vauxhall Motors[43][44]\n* Umbro[43][44]\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Terrorist attack[edit]\n\n\nA terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city.[45] The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.[46]\n\n\nThe Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n\n\n### Empty seats[edit]\n\n\nThe aggregate attendance of 1,276,000 and average attendance of 41,158 per game were the highest for the European Championship (in its 16-team format) until the 2012 tournament.[2] However, these numbers were based on the number of tickets sold rather than the number of spectators in the ground, which was often significantly lower. The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).[47]\n\n\n\n### Disorder[edit]\n\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.[48] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.[49]\n\n\nDespite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England's reputation after their fans' conduct during the previous decades.[48] UEFA's awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gallagher suffered an injury in the 28th minute and was replaced by fourth official Paul Durkin (England).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bevan, Chris (17 May 2012). \"Euro 1996: When football came home\". *BBC Sport*.

It took place in England from 8 to 30 June 1996. It was the first European Championship to feature 16 finalists, following UEFA's decision to expand the tournament from eight teams.\n\n\nMatches were staged in eight cities and, although not all games were sold out, the tournament holds the European Championship's second-highest aggregate attendance (1,276,000) and average per game (41,158) for the 16-team format,[1] surpassed only in 2012.[2]\n\n\nThe tournament was the first European Championship where three points were awarded for a win during the qualification and finals group stages, as opposed to the old system of two points for a win, reflecting the growing use of this system in domestic leagues throughout the world during the previous decade.\n\n\nGermany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany's first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required.[3] All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.[4]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992.[5] In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.[5]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer's 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick.[6] England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands.[7] Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on tie-breaking criteria.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Group A game between Scotland and the Netherlands at Villa Park\nGroup B had Western European France and Spain, along with Balkan World Cup participants Romania and Bulgaria. France and Spain dominated the group,[9][10] with France avenging Bulgaria for the 1994 qualification debacle,[11] and World Cup quarter-finalists Romania going home,[12] with no points and only one goal scored.\n\n\nGroups C and D saw the Czech Republic and Croatia, whose national teams had only recently come into existence, qualify for the knockout stage. The Czechs lost to Germany, the eventual group winners, in their opener, but then defeated Italy and drew with Russia.[13][14] Italy's defeat meant they had to beat Germany in their final game to progress, but the World Cup finalists could only manage a 0–0 draw and were eliminated.[15] In Group D, Croatia qualified for the quarter-finals, with wins over Turkey (1–0) and Denmark (3–0).[16] The loss to the Croats ultimately sent the Danes, the surprise champions of 1992, home. Turkey became the first team since the introduction of a group stage to be eliminated without gaining a point or scoring a goal.\n\n\nThe other three quarter-finalists were Portugal (whose \"Golden Generation\" was competing at its first major tournament), Spain, and a France team featuring a young Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n### Quarter-finals and semi-finals[edit]\n\n\nThe knockout stage was characterised by negative, defensive play; as a result, only nine goals were scored in the seven games and four of the matches were decided on penalties. The first quarter-final between the hosts and Spain ended goalless, after Spain had two goals disallowed and two claims for a penalty denied.[17] The English progressed 4–2 on spot kicks.[18] France and Netherlands also played out a 0–0 draw, with France winning the penalty shootout 5–4.[19] Jürgen Klinsmann opened the scoring for Germany in their match against Croatia. A goal from Davor Šuker evened the score after 51 minutes, before Matthias Sammer of Germany scored eight minutes later, and the game ended 2–1 to Germany.[20] Czech Republic progressed after beating Portugal 1–0.[21][22]\n\n\n\n![](image)The view of Wembley Stadium from Wembley Way before the semi-final between Germany and England\nThe first semi-final, featuring France and Czech Republic, resulted in another 0–0 draw and penalties. Reynald Pedros was the one player to miss in the shootout, as Czech Republic won the penalty shoot-out 6–5.[23] The other semi-final was a repeat of the 1990 World Cup semi-final between Germany and England. Alan Shearer headed in after three minutes to give his side the lead, but Stefan Kuntz evened the score less than 15 minutes later, and the score remained 1–1 after 90 minutes. In extra time, Paul Gascoigne came very close to scoring a golden goal, but fractionally missed a cross from Shearer in front of the empty goal, Darren Anderton hit the post, and Kuntz had a goal disallowed for pushing. Neither team was able to find a second goal. In penalties, both sides scored their first five kicks, but in the sixth round, Gareth Southgate had his penalty saved, allowing Andreas Möller to score the winning goal.[24]\n\n\n\n### Final match[edit]\n\n\nThe final saw the Czech Republic hoping to repeat Euro 1976 when Czechoslovakia defeated West Germany; the Germans were aiming to win their third European Championship. Patrik Berger scored from a penalty in 59th minute to put the Czechs ahead. German substitute Oliver Bierhoff scored in the 73rd minute to make it 1–1. Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff's shot was mishandled by Czech goalkeeper Kouba and the ball ended up in the back of the net for the first golden goal in the history of the competition.[25] Germany were European champions again, but for the first time as a unified country.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying\n\nOn 30 November 1992, UEFA formally decided to expand the tournament to sixteen teams.[26] UEFA cited the increased number of international teams following the recent break up of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia – rising from 33 UEFA members in 1988 to 48 by 1994 – as a driving factor behind the expansion.[27] Forty-seven teams ultimately entered to compete for the fifteen remaining places in the finals, alongside hosts England.[28]\n\n\nThe draw for the qualifying competition took place in Manchester on 22 January 1994.[29] The teams were divided into eight groups, each containing either six or five teams. The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the conclusion of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nWith the extended format, three teams were able to qualify for their first European Championship: Bulgaria, Switzerland and Turkey. Croatia, the Czech Republic and Russia competed for the first time in their own right since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union (though the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time that Sweden failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\nThe following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England | Host | 5 May 1992 | 4 (1968, 1980, 1988, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 2 winner | 11 October 1995 | 4 (***1964***, 1980, 1984, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia[B] | Group 8 winner | 11 October 1995 | 6 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image)  Switzerland | Group 3 winner | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | Group 4 winner | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | 4th best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 1 (1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | 2nd best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[C] | Group 7 winner | 15 November 1995 | 6 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 1 winner | 15 November 1995 | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 3rd best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 5th best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 4 (1964, 1984, 1988, **1992**)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic[D] | Group 5 winner | 15 November 1995 | 3 (1960, **1976**, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 1st best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 3 (***1968***, *1980*, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) France | 6th best runner-up | 15 November 1995 | 3 (*1960*, ***1984***, 1992)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 6 winner | 15 November 1995 | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Play-off winner | 13 December 1995 | 4 (1976, 1980, **1988**, 1992)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, Russia competed as the Soviet Union, and in 1992 as CIS.\n3. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n4. **^** From 1960 to 1980, the Czech Republic competed as Czechoslovakia.\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 December 1995 at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham.[30] Only four teams were seeded: England (as hosts), Denmark (as holders), Spain and Germany (as the two highest ranked teams). The remaining twelve teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group.[30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) England (hosts)[a] | ![](image) Bulgaria | ![](image) Italy | ![](image) Russia |\n| ![](image) Denmark (holders)[b] | ![](image) Croatia | ![](image) Netherlands | ![](image) Scotland |\n| ![](image) Germany | ![](image) Czech Republic | ![](image) Portugal | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| ![](image) Spain | ![](image) France | ![](image) Romania | ![](image) Turkey |\n\n\nAutomatically selected as a top-seeded team into pot 1, irrespective of their ranking position.\n\n1. **^** Hosts England were automatically assigned to group position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions Denmark were automatically assigned to Pot 1, and could be drawn into group position B1, C1 or D1.\n\n**Draw procedure:**[30]\n\n\n\n1. The unseeded teams were first drawn one by one without being revealed from Pot 2, and placed consecutively into four group bowls labelled I to IV. The teams drawn first, fifth and ninth were put into the Group I bowl; second, sixth and tenth were put into the Group II bowl; third, seventh and eleventh were put into the Group III bowl; and fourth, eighth and twelfth were put into the Group IV bowl.\n2. The team drawn first from each group bowl was placed into position 4 in their group; the team drawn second in position 3; and the team drawn third in position 2.\n3. Finally, the four top-seeded teams were drawn from the separate Pot 1 bowl, and placed consecutively into position 1 of each group bowl.\n4. While it was decreed in advance ahead of the draw, that England's group would be Group A (irrespective of their drawn group label), the remaining three groups then consecutively had the three remaining letters (B, C and D) drawn from yet another bowl to decide the letter name of their group, which also determined what venues they would play at.\n\n\nThe balls were drawn by UEFA figures Gerhard Aigner and Lennart Johansson.[30]\n\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) England |\n| A2 | ![](image)  Switzerland |\n| A3 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| A4 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| Wembley and Villa Park\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| B2 | ![](image) Bulgaria |\n| B3 | ![](image) Romania |\n| B4 | ![](image) France |\n| Elland Road and St James Park\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup C\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| C1 | ![](image) Germany |\n| C2 | ![](image) Czech Republic |\n| C3 | ![](image) Italy |\n| C4 | ![](image) Russia |\n| Old Trafford and Anfield\n |\n\n | \n\nGroup D\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| D1 | ![](image) Denmark |\n| D2 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| D3 | ![](image) Turkey |\n| D4 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| Hillsborough and City Ground\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nSince the implementation of the Taylor Report in 1990, following the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, England now had enough all-seater stadia of sufficient capacity to hold an expanded tournament due to the necessary stadium refurbishment by its leading clubs. The stadium capacities listed in the table are for the time of the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 1996 is located in England](image)![London](image)\nLondon\n![Manchester](image)\nManchester\n![Liverpool](image)\nLiverpool\n![Birmingham](image)\nBirmingham\n![Leeds](image)\nLeeds\n![Sheffield](image)\nSheffield\n![Nottingham](image)\nNottingham\n![Newcastle](image)\nNewcastle\n | London | Manchester |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Wembley Stadium | Old Trafford |\n| Capacity: **76,567** | Capacity: **55,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Liverpool | Birmingham |\n| Anfield | Villa Park |\n| Capacity: **42,730** | Capacity: **40,310** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Leeds | Sheffield | Nottingham | Newcastle |\n| Elland Road | Hillsborough | City Ground | St James' Park |\n| Capacity: **40,204** | Capacity: **39,859** | Capacity: **30,539** | Capacity: **36,649** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1996 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 22 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers.\n\n\n\n## Finals format[edit]\n\n\nTo accommodate the expansion from an 8-team finals tournament to 16 teams, the format was changed from that used in 1992 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phases. The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adidas Questra\n\nA custom version of the Adidas Questra, the *Questra Europa*, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.[32]\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\nMatch officials are listed in the two collapsed tables below.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Assistants\n | Fourth official\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Gerd Grabher | Egon Bereuter\n | Manfred Zeiszer\n | Günter Benkö | Netherlands 1–4 England |\n| ![](image) Belarus | Vadim Zhuk | Yuri Dupanov\n | Aleh Chykun\n | Kazimir Znaydinsky\n | France 1–1 Spain |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Guy Goethals | Marc Van den Broeck\n | Stany Op de Beeck\n | Michel Piraux | Italy 0–0 Germany |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Atanas Uzunov | Ivan Borissov Lekov\n | Iordan Iordanov\n | Stefan Ormandjiev\n | Switzerland 0–0 Netherlands |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Václav Krondl | Milan Brabec\n | Otakar Draštík\n | Jiří Ulrich\n | Scotland 1–0 Switzerland |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Peter Mikkelsen | Jens Larsen\n | Henning Knudsen\n | Knud Erik Fisker | Bulgaria 1–0 Romania |\n| Kim Milton Nielsen | Carl-Johan Christensen Meyer\n | Torben Siersen\n | Lars Gerner\n | Russia 0–3 Germany |\n| ![](image) England | David Elleray | Anthony Bates | Peter Walton | Stephen Lodge | Germany 2–0 Czech Republic |\n| Dermot Gallagher | Phil Joslin | Mark Warren | Paul Durkin | France 3–1 Bulgaria |\n| ![](image) France | Marc Batta | Pierre Ufrasi\n | Jacques Mas\n | Alain Sars | Croatia 3–0 DenmarkSpain 0–0 England (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Germany | Bernd Heynemann | Hans Wolf\n | Harald Sather\n | Hartmut Strampe | Croatia 0–3 Portugal |\n| Hellmut Krug | Klaus Plettenberg\n | Egbert Engler\n | Hermann Albrecht | Romania 0–1 FranceCzech Republic 1–0 Portugal |\n| ![](image) Hungary | Sándor Puhl | László Hamar\n | Imre Bozóky\n | Sándor Piller\n | Portugal 1–0 TurkeyGermany 1–1 England (Semi-final) |\n| ![](image) Italy | Piero Ceccarini | Enrico Preziosi\n | Fabrizio Zanforlin\n | Alfredo Trentalange | Spain 1–1 Bulgaria |\n| Pierluigi Pairetto | Donato Nicoletti\n | Tullio Manfredini\n | Marcello Nicchi\n | Scotland 0–2 EnglandCzech Republic 1–2 Germany (Final) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Mario van der Ende | Jan Dolstra\n | Berend Talens\n | René Temmink | Denmark 1–1 Portugal |\n| ![](image) Russia | Nikolai Levnikov | Serguei Foursa\n | Sergei Frantsuzov\n | Sergei Khusainov | Turkey 0–3 Denmark |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Leslie Mottram | Robert Orr\n | John Fleming\n | Hugh Dallas | Italy 2–1 RussiaFrance 0–0 Czech Republic (Semi-final) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Manuel Díaz Vega | Joaquín Olmos González\n | Fernando Tresaco Gracia\n | José María García-Aranda | England 1–1 Switzerland |\n| Antonio López Nieto | Victoriano Giráldez Carrasco\n | Manuel López Fernández\n | Juan Ansuátegui Roca\n | Czech Republic 2–1 ItalyFrance 0–0 Netherlands (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Anders Frisk | Mikael Nilsson\n | Sten Samuelsson\n | Morgan Norman\n | Russia 3–3 Czech Republic |\n| Leif Sundell | Kenneth Petersson\n | Mikael Hansson\n | Karl-Erik Nilsson | Netherlands 0–0 ScotlandGermany 2–1 Croatia (Quarter-final) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Serge Muhmenthaler | Ernst Felder\n | Martin Freiburghaus\n | Urs Meier | Turkey 0–1 Croatia |\n| ![](image) Turkey | Ahmet Çakar | Akif Uğurdur\n | Turgay Güdü\n | Oğuz Sarvan | Romania 1–2 Spain |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Finishing positions of the participating teams\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progress to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.

Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;\n2. Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points);\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points);\n4. If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3 to more than two teams, two teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the two teams in question to determine the final rankings of the two teams. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 apply in the order given;\n5. Superior goal difference in all group matches;\n6. Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;\n7.

Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time. For the first time in a major football competition, the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner. If no goal was scored there would be a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. For the first time the final was won by a golden goal.\n\n\nAs with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.\n\n\n*All times are local, BST (UTC+1).*\n\n\n\n###

Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Slogan and theme songs[edit]\n\n\nThe competition slogan was **Football Comes Home** reflecting that the sport's rules were first standardised in the United Kingdom. UEFA President Lennart Johansson had said that the organisation had felt it was time to bring the event \"back to the motherland of football\".[29]\n\n\nThe slogan was incorporated into the competition's most popular song: \"Three Lions\" recorded by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with Britpop band the Lightning Seeds. Baddiel and Skinner were then strongly connected with football owing to their BBC show *Fantasy Football League*.[37] Released as a single, the song topped the UK Singles Chart for a total of two weeks.[38] It was promoted by a video featuring the England squad.[37]\n\n\nThe song was prominently sung by England fans during all their games, and was also chanted by the German team upon parading the trophy in Berlin after the tournament. It was even referenced by future Prime Minister Tony Blair in an address at the 1996 Labour Party Conference with the line: *\"Seventeen years of hurt, never stopped us dreaming, Labour's coming home\".*[39]\n\n\n\"Three Lions\" was the official song of the England team, and is the song most strongly connected with the tournament, however the official song of the tournament was \"We're in This Together\" by Simply Red. The song was performed at the tournament's opening ceremony.[40]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise and mascots[edit]\n\n\nThe British Royal Mint issued a commemorative £2 coin in 1996, which featured a representation of a football, \"1996\" in the centre, and 16 small rings representing the 16 competing teams. Further special coins were only issued in the Isle of Man and Gibraltar.[41]\n\n\nThe official mascot, 'Goaliath', was designed in a similar fashion to the original World Cup mascot from the 1966 World Cup. Goaliath comprised a lion, the image on the English team crest, dressed in an England football strip and football boots whilst holding a football under his right arm.[42]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Event sponsors\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * Canon[43][44]\n* Carlsberg[43][44]\n* Coca-Cola[43][44]\n* Fujifilm[43][44]\n* JVC[43][44]\n* MasterCard[43][44]\n | * McDonald's[43][44]\n* Philips[43][44]\n* Snickers[43][44]\n* Vauxhall Motors[43][44]\n* Umbro[43][44]\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Terrorist attack[edit]\n\n\nA terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city.[45] The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.[46]\n\n\nThe Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.\n\n\n\n### Empty seats[edit]\n\n\nThe aggregate attendance of 1,276,000 and average attendance of 41,158 per game were the highest for the European Championship (in its 16-team format) until the 2012 tournament.[2] However, these numbers were based on the number of tickets sold rather than the number of spectators in the ground, which was often significantly lower. The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00 pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA's policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).[47]\n\n\n\n### Disorder[edit]\n\n\nAfter England's defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties.[48] A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.[49]\n\n\nDespite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England's reputation after their fans' conduct during the previous decades.[48] UEFA's awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[50][51]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gallagher suffered an injury in the 28th minute and was replaced by fourth official Paul Durkin (England).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bevan, Chris (17 May 2012). \"Euro 1996: When football came home\". *BBC Sport*.

It was the ninth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nDenmark won the 1992 championship, having qualified only after Yugoslavia was disqualified as a result of the breakup of the country and the ensuing warfare there. Eight national teams contested the final tournament.[1]\n\n\nThe CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States), representing the recently dissolved Soviet Union, whose national team had qualified for the tournament, were present at the tournament. It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.\n\n\nIt was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event.[2] Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSeven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event.[4] The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),[5] before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.\n\n\nOriginally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia's qualifying group, was invited to take part instead.[6] After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they would face the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten's kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against reigning world champions Germany.[7] Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.[8]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nScotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Host | 16 December 1988 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1991 | 2 (*1960*, ***1984***)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 13 November 1991 | 3 (1968, 1980, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) CIS[B] | Group 3 winner[C] | 13 November 1991 | 5 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Group 2 winner | 13 November 1991 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[D] | Group 5 winner | 20 November 1991 | 5 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 6 winner | 4 December 1991 | 3 (1976, 1980, **1988**)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 4 runner-up[E] | 31 May 1992 | 3 (1964, 1984, 1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, CIS competed as the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** Replaced the Soviet Union.\n4. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n5. **^** Replaced FR Yugoslavia (after qualifying as Yugoslavia), who were subject to sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 757 and thus banned from appearing.[9]\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders).[10][11] The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last 2 in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Sweden (hosts)[a]\n* ![](image) Netherlands (holders)[b]\n | * ![](image) CIS\n* ![](image) England\n | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Germany\n | * ![](image) Scotland\n* ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~[c]\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Hosts Sweden were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions the Netherlands were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Yugoslavia were to participate in the final tournament as FR Yugoslavia. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions on 30 May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 after the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars.[9] FIFA and UEFA therefore suspended FR Yugoslavia from competitive football on 31 May 1992, meaning they could not participate in the final tournament. Denmark instead took the spot at the final tournament.\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| A2 | ![](image) France |\n| A3 | ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~ → ![](image) Denmark |\n| A4 | ![](image) England |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| B3 | ![](image) CIS |\n| B4 | ![](image) Germany |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gothenburg | ![UEFA Euro 1992 is located in Sweden](image)![Gothenburg](image)\nGothenburg\n![Stockholm](image)\nStockholm\n![Malmö](image)\nMalmö\n![Norrköping](image)\nNorrköping\n | Stockholm |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ullevi | Råsunda Stadium |\n| Capacity: **44,000** | Capacity: **40,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Malmö | Norrköping |\n| Malmö Stadion | Idrottsparken |\n| Capacity: **30,000** | Capacity: **23,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nAdidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament.

It was the ninth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nDenmark won the 1992 championship, having qualified only after Yugoslavia was disqualified as a result of the breakup of the country and the ensuing warfare there. Eight national teams contested the final tournament.[1]\n\n\nThe CIS national football team (Commonwealth of Independent States), representing the recently dissolved Soviet Union, whose national team had qualified for the tournament, were present at the tournament. It was also the first major tournament in which the reunified Germany (who were beaten 2–0 by Denmark in the final) had competed.\n\n\nIt was the last tournament with only eight participants, to award the winner of a match with only two points, and before the introduction of the back-pass rule, the latter of which was brought in immediately after the tournament was completed. When the next competition was held in 1996, 16 teams were involved and were awarded three points for a win.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 December 1988, following a decision made by the UEFA Executive Committee, Sweden was chosen over Spain to host the event.[2] Spain was at a disadvantage as they had already been chosen to host the EXPO 1992 in Seville and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSeven of the eight teams had to qualify for the final stage; Sweden qualified automatically as hosts of the event.[4] The Soviet Union qualified for the final tournament shortly before the break-up of the country, and took part in the tournament under the banner of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),[5] before the former Soviet republics formed their own national teams after the competition. The CIS team represented the following former Soviet nations: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and Tajikistan. Four out of 15 ex-republics were not members of the CIS: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania did not send their players; Georgia was not a member of the CIS at the time, but Georgian Kakhaber Tskhadadze was a part of the squad.\n\n\nOriginally, Yugoslavia qualified for the final stage and were about to participate as FR Yugoslavia, but due to the Yugoslav Wars, the team was disqualified and Denmark, as the runners-up from Yugoslavia's qualifying group, was invited to take part instead.[6] After a draw with England and a loss to host nation Sweden, Denmark beat France in their final group match to qualify for the semi-finals, where they would face the reigning European champions, the Netherlands. Denmark led 2–1 going into the last five minutes, but a Frank Rijkaard equaliser meant the game went to a penalty shoot-out; Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel saved Marco van Basten's kick, giving Denmark a 5–4 win on penalties and a place in the final against reigning world champions Germany.[7] Denmark won the final 2–0 with goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort in either half to claim their first European title.[8]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying\n\nScotland and the hosts Sweden made their respective debuts despite having already made many appearances at the World Cup. France qualified for the first Euro in which they were not the hosts. They played after missing the previous tournament.\n\n\nAs of 2020, this was the last time the Czech Republic (then Czechoslovakia), Italy, Portugal and Spain failed to qualify for the European Championship finals.\n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Host | 16 December 1988 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) France | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1991 | 2 (*1960*, ***1984***)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 7 winner | 13 November 1991 | 3 (1968, 1980, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) CIS[B] | Group 3 winner[C] | 13 November 1991 | 5 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Group 2 winner | 13 November 1991 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Germany[D] | Group 5 winner | 20 November 1991 | 5 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984, *1988*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 6 winner | 4 December 1991 | 3 (1976, 1980, **1988**)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 4 runner-up[E] | 31 May 1992 | 3 (1964, 1984, 1988)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n2. **^** From 1960 to 1988, CIS competed as the Soviet Union.\n3. **^** Replaced the Soviet Union.\n4. **^** From 1972 to 1988, Germany competed as West Germany.\n5. **^** Replaced FR Yugoslavia (after qualifying as Yugoslavia), who were subject to sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 757 and thus banned from appearing.[9]\n\n### Final draw[edit]\n\n\nThe draw for the final tournament took place on 17 January 1992 in Gothenburg. Only two teams were seeded: Sweden (as hosts) and the Netherlands (as holders).[10][11] The remaining six teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group. Months after the draw, Yugoslavia was banned from participating and replaced by Denmark, which had come second in the qualifying group.\n\n\nIn the draw procedure, the unseeded teams were drawn one by one. The first two were placed in position 4 of each group, the next two in position 3, and the last 2 in position 2. The two seeded teams were then drawn and placed consecutively into position 1 of the groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pot 1: Seeded teams\n | Pot 2: Unseeded teams\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Sweden (hosts)[a]\n* ![](image) Netherlands (holders)[b]\n | * ![](image) CIS\n* ![](image) England\n | * ![](image) France\n* ![](image) Germany\n | * ![](image) Scotland\n* ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~[c]\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Hosts Sweden were automatically assigned to position A1.\n2. **^** Defending champions the Netherlands were automatically assigned to position B1.\n3. **^** Yugoslavia were to participate in the final tournament as FR Yugoslavia. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was placed under sanctions on 30 May 1992 by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 after the outbreak of Yugoslav Wars.[9] FIFA and UEFA therefore suspended FR Yugoslavia from competitive football on 31 May 1992, meaning they could not participate in the final tournament. Denmark instead took the spot at the final tournament.\n\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nGroup A\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| A1 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| A2 | ![](image) France |\n| A3 | ~~![](image) Yugoslavia~~ → ![](image) Denmark |\n| A4 | ![](image) England |\n\n | \n\nGroup B\n| Pos | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| B1 | ![](image) Netherlands |\n| B2 | ![](image) Scotland |\n| B3 | ![](image) CIS |\n| B4 | ![](image) Germany |\n\n |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gothenburg | ![UEFA Euro 1992 is located in Sweden](image)![Gothenburg](image)\nGothenburg\n![Stockholm](image)\nStockholm\n![Malmö](image)\nMalmö\n![Norrköping](image)\nNorrköping\n | Stockholm |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Ullevi | Råsunda Stadium |\n| Capacity: **44,000** | Capacity: **40,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Malmö | Norrköping |\n| Malmö Stadion | Idrottsparken |\n| Capacity: **30,000** | Capacity: **23,000** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1992 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match ball[edit]\n\n\nAdidas Etrusco Unico was used as the official match ball of the tournament.

It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nFrance were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. \n\n\nThe tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time. Euro 88 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. Euro 1988 was the final European Championship to see teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 separate countries in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nWest Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England.[1]\n\n\nBecause the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA.[*citation needed*] In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games.\n\n\nAs a compromise, Berlin Olympic Stadium did host a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.[2]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.\n\n\nThe Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy's goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.\n\n\nSpain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\nIn the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.\n\n\nThe Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.\n\n\nThe second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B.[3] In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.\n\n\nEngland met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher's replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.\n\n\nThe Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.\n\n\nNeeding to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.[4]\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition's final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.\n\n\nThe other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union's fourth appearance in a European Championship final.\n\n\nThe final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation's last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten's goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nSeven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition.[7] Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984). The following eight teams qualified for the final tournament:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances  in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Host | 14 March 1985 | 4 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 6 winner | 14 October 1987 | 2 (1964, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Soviet Union | Group 3 winner | 28 October 1987 | 4 (**1960**, 1964, 1968, 1972)\n |\n| ![](image) England | Group 4 winner | 11 November 1987 | 2 (1968, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of Ireland | Group 7 winner | 11 November 1987 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | Group 2 winner | 14 November 1987 | 2 (***1968***, *1980*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 1 winner | 18 November 1987 | 3 (***1964***, 1980, 1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Group 5 winner | 9 December 1987 | 2 (1976, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| ![UEFA Euro 1988 is located in FRG and West Berlin](image)![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Düsseldorf](image)\nDüsseldorf\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n | Munich | Gelsenkirchen |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Olympiastadion | Parkstadion |\n| Capacity: **69,256** | Capacity: **70,748** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Hamburg | Frankfurt |\n| Volksparkstadion | Waldstadion |\n| Capacity: **61,330** | Capacity: **61,056** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Düsseldorf | Hanover | Stuttgart | Cologne |\n| Rheinstadion | Niedersachsenstadion | Neckarstadion | Müngersdorfer Stadion |\n| Capacity: **68,400** | Capacity: **60,366** | Capacity: **70,705** | Capacity: **60,584** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Special stamp issued by Deutsche Bundespost for the tournament\n\n\n| Country\n | Referee\n | Linesmen\n | Matches refereed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Austria | Horst Brummeier | Heinz Holzmann | Helmut Kohl | Republic of Ireland–Netherlands (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Alexis Ponnet | Frans Van Den Wijngaert | Jean-François Crucke | Soviet Union–Italy (semi-finals) |\n| ![](image) East Germany | Siegfried Kirschen | Klaus Peschel | Manfred Roßner | England–Republic of Ireland (group 2) |\n| ![](image) England | Keith Hackett | Neil Midgley | Brian Hill | West Germany–Italy (group 1) |\n| ![](image) France | Michel Vautrot | Gérard Biguet | Rémi Harrel | West Germany–Spain (group 1)Soviet Union–Netherlands (final) |\n| ![](image) Italy | Paolo Casarin | Carlo Longhi | Pierluigi Magni | England–Netherlands (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | Bep Thomas | John Blankenstein | Jacob van der Niet | Denmark–Spain (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Portugal | José Rosa dos Santos | José Francisco Conceição Silva | Fortunato Alves de Azevedo | England–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Romania | Ioan Igna | Ștefan Dan Petrescu | Ion Crăciunescu | West Germany–Netherlands (semi-finals) |\n| ![](image) Scotland | Bob Valentine | Kenny Hope | Andrew Waddell | West Germany–Denmark (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Spain | Emilio Soriano Aladrén | José Donato Pes Pérez | José Mauro Socorro González | Republic of Ireland–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n| ![](image) Sweden | Erik Fredriksson | Bo Karlsson | Christer Drottz | Italy–Spain (group 1) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | Bruno Galler | Renzo Peduzzi | Philippe Mercier | Italy–Denmark (group 1) |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Dieter Pauly | Karl-Heinz Tritschler | Aron Schmidhuber | Netherlands–Soviet Union (group 2) |\n\n\n**Fourth officials**\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(December 2019)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Fourth officials\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Poland | Michał Listkiewicz |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Karl-Josef Assenmacher |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Werner Föckler |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Wolf-Günter Wiesel |\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results for UEFA Euro 1988 finalists\nThe teams finishing in the top two of each group progressed to the semi-finals.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It was the eighth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and supported by UEFA.\n\n\nFrance were the defending champions, but failed to qualify. \n\n\nThe tournament crowned the Netherlands as European champions for the first time. Euro 88 was a rare instance of a major football tournament ending without a single sending-off or goalless draw, nor any knockout matches going to extra time or penalties. Euro 1988 was the final European Championship to see teams from West Germany and the Soviet Union, as the West and East Germans reunified to become Germany in 1990, and the Soviet Union disintegrated into 15 separate countries in 1991.\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nWest Germany won the right to host the tournament with five votes ahead of a joint bid from Norway, Sweden and Denmark, which earned one vote, and a bid from England.[1]\n\n\nBecause the Eastern Bloc disagreed that West Berlin was part of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Football Association ruled out playing Championship matches in West Berlin. This secured the participation of Eastern European members of UEFA.[*citation needed*] In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, however, West Berlin had hosted three games.\n\n\nAs a compromise, Berlin Olympic Stadium did host a Four Nations Tournament in 1988, with West Germany playing against the Soviet Union, Argentina and Sweden.[2]\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe first group pitted two pre-tournament favourites West Germany and Italy together, along with Spain and Denmark. The West German team had won the 1980 European Championship and were the runners-up in each of the last two World Cups in 1982 and 1986, although in 1984 they failed to qualify from their group. With such results and additionally as the host they were commonly considered the main favourite of the tournament.\n\n\nThe Italians had not played at Euro 1984, though they had finished fourth in the 1980 tournament, for which they were the hosts; they had also won the 1982 World Cup, albeit followed by a middling performance in 1986. Spain and Denmark contested the second semi-final of the 1984 edition, in which Spain prevailed on penalty-kicks, but then lost the final to hosts, France (who failed to qualify in 1988). Both Spain and Denmark played in the 1986 World Cup, and met there again, in a Round of 16 match of the knockout stage which Spain won 5–1.\n\n\nThe Germans and Italians played out the opening game. This game was tightly contested. Roberto Mancini capitalised on a defensive error on the left-hand side of the German goal and the striker squeezed in a shot from a tight angle low to the left corner. Just three minutes later, Italy's goalkeeper, Walter Zenga was penalised for taking more than four steps with the ball and Andreas Brehme scored the resulting free-kick from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot to the right corner. Both teams settled for a 1–1 draw.\n\n\nSpain defeated Denmark again, this time 3–2. Míchel opened the scoring after five minutes with a shot to the left corner from inside the penalty area and Michael Laudrup equalised 20 minutes later with a left foot shot from the edge of the penalty area to the left corner. Spain dominated the next hour and Emilio Butragueño scored with a low shot through the goalkeepers legs and then Rafael Gordillo putting the Spanish 3–1 to the good with a free-kick which deceived the goalkeeper. A late surge saw Flemming Povlsen reduce the scoreline with a header in off the left post, but was not enough for the Danes, who now needed to win both their remaining games to be certain of a place in the semi-finals.\n\n\nIn the remaining games the West Germans swept aside the Danes and Spanish. Jürgen Klinsmann and Olaf Thon scored to dispatch the former 2–0 while two goals from Rudi Völler were enough to beat Spain 2–0. The second goal was particularly notable. Lothar Matthäus ran 40 yards into the Spanish penalty box before back-heeling the ball for the oncoming Völler, following up his run, to strike the ball with the outside of his foot and into the corner of the goal.\n\n\nThe Italians won a difficult match against the Spanish 1–0, courtesy of a goal from Gianluca Vialli, a low cross-shot to the net on 73 minutes. In the last game, against an already eliminated Denmark, the Italians prevailed 2–0.\n\n\nThe second group witnessed a surprising set of results. In the opening game, one of the pre-tournament favourites England lost 1–0 to Ireland. Ray Houghton scored a looping header after six minutes after the English defence failed to clear a cross. The English applied strong pressure as the game wore on. Gary Lineker was unusually sluggish, missing a series of chances and hitting the crossbar – he was later diagnosed with hepatitis B.[3] In the other opening game, the Soviet Union defeated the Netherlands 1–0 through a Vasyl Rats goal, despite the Dutch dominating for long periods.\n\n\nEngland met the Netherlands in Düsseldorf; both needed to win. England started strongly with Lineker hitting a post and Glenn Hoddle striking the post with a free-kick. The English defence, weakened by the absence of Terry Butcher, conceded the first of three goals to Marco van Basten on 44 minutes. Van Basten turned Butcher's replacement Tony Adams and beat Peter Shilton – playing his 100th game for England – to give his side a 1–0 lead. England rallied after the break. Lineker and Bryan Robson exchanged a kick one-two pass allowing Robson to burst into the box and lift the ball over Hans van Breukelen after 53 minutes. The score remained until Van Basten turned Tony Adams inside out to finish from 18 yards on 71 minutes. The striker pounced from close-range after a corner to seal a 3–1 win four minutes later.\n\n\nThe Irish and Soviets led the group after two games through a 1–1 draw in Hanover. Ronnie Whelan scored a spectacular left-foot volley from 18 yards to put the Irish into the lead. Oleh Protasov equalised with a low shot as the Soviets exerted late pressure.\n\n\nNeeding to defeat the Irish to progress, the Dutch won the game 1–0 through a late Wim Kieft goal. The ball deflected into his path and he delivered a looping header which spun into the right corner of the Irish net with nine minutes remaining just after Paul McGrath hit a Dutch post with a header. In the other game, the Soviets soundly thrashed England. A mistake from Hoddle allowed Sergei Aleinikov to score after three minutes. Adams equalised and England had chances to go ahead, but a goal before half-time and late in the game assured the Soviet Union would finish in first place in the group.[4]\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final was significant as rivals West Germany played the Netherlands. It was only the third time the two sides had faced each other since the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final; the West Germans winning a first round match in the 1980 European Championship, and a 2–2 draw in a 1978 FIFA World Cup second round group match. The game was tight, and the West Germans broke the deadlock on 55 minutes with a Matthäus penalty after a foul on Klinsmann. The lead was held for 20 minutes until Jürgen Kohler brought down Van Basten. Ronald Koeman converted the spot-kick to level the match. With the match headed for extra time, a through ball caught the Germans out and Van Basten finished clinically with a shot as he slid along the floor, beating the goalkeeper and Kohler to the ball in the 88th minute for a 2–1 win. It gave the Dutch their first competitive victory against the Germans and the first appearance in the competition's final. The victory was marred by the reaction of Dutch defender Koeman who wiped the shirt of Olaf Thon, given to him after the match, on his backside in front of the German fans. The player apologised afterwards.\n\n\nThe other semi-final was another unpredictable result. Italy were strong favourites to reach the final and had beaten the Soviets 4–1 in a friendly just two months earlier. Despite controlling the play and having the majority of the chances, the Italians were undone by poor finishing and a strong, tough opposition who sought to stop their more skilful opponents from playing through hard tackles and a defensive strategy. The hard work-rate of the Soviets paid off and in just four second-half minutes, counter-attacks saw two goals from Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleg Protasov. The first one from Lytovchenko was initially blocked, but with quick reactions he beat Franco Baresi to the ball to fire the second shot into the far corner. The second from Protasov was a looping shot that floated over Zenga for a 2–0 victory. It would be the Soviet Union's fourth appearance in a European Championship final.\n\n\nThe final was played on 25 June between the Soviet Union, in what would turn out to be the nation's last European Championship match, and the Netherlands at the Olympiastadion in Munich. The Dutch won the match 2–0, with goals by captain Ruud Gullit and tournament top scorer Marco van Basten. Hans van Breukelen blocked a low penalty shot of Igor Belanov. Van Basten's goal, a sharply hit volley across the goal off an incoming looping pass, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\nSeven countries had to qualify for the final stage. West Germany qualified automatically as hosts of the event. The Republic of Ireland qualified for the first time for any major tournament. The holders, France, failed to qualify despite finishing third in the 1986 World Cup. As of 2024, this is the last time that France failed to qualify for the European Championship finals, and since the conversion to a group stage in the finals tournament, this remains the only time the previous tournament winners failed to qualify for the next competition.[7] Other notable absentees were Belgium (the 1980 runners-up and 1986 FIFA World Cup semi-finalists) and Portugal (semi-finalists of Euro 1984).

It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.\n\n\nAt the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France's five matches, *Les Bleus* won the championship – their first major international title.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.[2]\n\n\n\n## Tournament summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini's goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France's 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.\n\n\nGroup 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win against Romania that sent the holders out.\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship.[3] Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.\n\n\nThe other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby's goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964.\n\n\nThe final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying\n\nPortugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. \n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 10 December 1981 | 1 (*1960*)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1983 | 2 (*1972*, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 2 winner | 1 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 3 winner | 16 November 1983 | 1 (1964)\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Group 6 winner | 20 November 1983 | 3 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 5 winner | 30 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia | Group 4 winner | 21 December 1983 | 3 (1960, 1968, *1976*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 7 winner | 21 December 1983 | 2 (***1964***, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n### Tournament format[edit]\n\n\nAfter trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships.[4] The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.\n\n\nFixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.\n\n\n\n### Overall impressions[edit]\n\n\nVery few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless,[*citation needed*] a feat that established France's credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this European Championship was **Peno**, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFrance's winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille's Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France's largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris | Marseille | Lyon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parc des Princes | Stade Vélodrome | Stade de Gerland |\n| Capacity: **48,360** | Capacity: **55,000** | Capacity: **51,860** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 1984 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\nLyon\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nantes](image)\nNantes\n![Strasbourg](image)\nStrasbourg\n | Saint-Étienne |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard |\n| Capacity: **48,274** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Lens | Nantes | Strasbourg |\n| Stade Félix-Bollaert | Stade de la Beaujoire | Stade de la Meinau |\n| Capacity: **49,000** | Capacity: **52,923** | Capacity: **42,756** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n* ![Austria](image) Heinz Fahnler\n* ![Belgium](image) Alexis Ponnet\n* ![Czechoslovakia](image) Vojtech Christov\n* ![East Germany](image) Adolf Prokop\n* ![England](image) George Courtney\n* ![France](image) Michel Vautrot\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Bergamo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Jan Keizer\n* ![Scotland](image) Bob Valentine\n* ![Spain](image) Augusto Lamo Castillo\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Romualdas Juška\n* ![Sweden](image) Erik Fredriksson\n* ![Switzerland](image) André Daina\n* ![West Germany](image) Volker Roth\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1984 UEFA European Championship finalists.\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.

It was the seventh UEFA European Championship, a competition held every four years and endorsed by UEFA.\n\n\nAt the time, only eight countries took part in the final stage of the tournament, seven of which had to come through the qualifying stage. France qualified automatically as hosts of the event; in the tournament led by Michel Platini, who scored nine goals in France's five matches, *Les Bleus* won the championship – their first major international title.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Bid process[edit]\n\n\nThe hosting of the event was contested by bids from France and West Germany. The French bid was unanimously selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting on 10 December 1981.[2]\n\n\n\n## Tournament summary[edit]\n\n\n### Group matches[edit]\n\n\nThe opening game of tournament featured France and Denmark. The sides played out a very close encounter until Michel Platini's goal on 78 minutes gave the hosts a 1–0 victory. The opening game also saw a premature end to the tournament for Danish midfielder Allan Simonsen, who suffered a broken leg. Platini then scored hat-tricks against both Belgium and Yugoslavia as the French recorded maximum points in Group 1. Denmark took second place in the group with victories over Belgium and Yugoslavia, while Belgium finished third with two points. Yugoslavia, despite going out with no points, gave the hosts a fright in their last group game when they took a 1–0 lead into half-time and then reduced France's 3–1 lead to one goal six minutes from time. The games in Group 1 were unusually high-scoring, and featured 23 goals over the six matches.\n\n\nGroup 2 provided fewer goals, but produced a huge surprise as West Germany failed to qualify for the semi-finals after a 1–0 defeat in their last match to Spain with a late goal by Antonio Maceda, and a late Portugal win against Romania that sent the holders out.\n\n\n\n### Semi-finals and final[edit]\n\n\nThe first semi-final between France and Portugal is often considered one of the best matches in the history of the European Championship.[3] Jean-François Domergue opened the scoring for France but Portugal equalised through Rui Jordão on 74 minutes. The game went to extra time and Jordão scored again in the 98th minute to give the Portuguese a shock lead, but the French rallied and Domergue equalised with six minutes left. Then, in the dying moments of the match and with a penalty shoot-out looming, Platini scored his eighth goal of the championship to give France a memorable 3–2 victory.\n\n\nThe other semi-final between Spain and Denmark saw two evenly matched sides draw 1–1 after extra time, as Søren Lerby's goal after only seven minutes was cancelled out by Maceda’s strike an hour later. The match went to a penalty shoot-out, and Spain converted all five of their penalties to win 5–4 and reach the final for the first time since 1964.\n\n\nThe final was played to a capacity crowd at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Just before the hour mark, Platini scored from a free-kick to put France ahead following a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Luis Arconada. France were reduced to ten players when Yvon Le Roux was sent off, but Spain were unable to equalise, and Bruno Bellone's goal in injury time made the final score 2–0. France had won their first major championship in world football.\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 qualifying\n\nPortugal and Romania made their debuts in the European Championship. France, the hosts and eventual winners, qualified for the first time since inaugural tournament in 1960, which they also hosted. Denmark qualified for the first time since 1964. Yugoslavia qualified after missing the 1980 tournament. Notable absentees were the 1982 FIFA World Cup winners and Euro 1980 hosts Italy, as well as 1966 World Cup winners England, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands (who failed to qualify for the last time until 2016) and Hungary. \n\n\n\n### Qualified teams[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Qualified as\n | Qualified on\n | Previous appearances in tournament[A] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) France | Host | 10 December 1981 | 1 (*1960*)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | Group 1 winner | 12 October 1983 | 2 (*1972*, 1980)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Group 2 winner | 1 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Group 3 winner | 16 November 1983 | 1 (1964)\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany | Group 6 winner | 20 November 1983 | 3 (**1972**, 1976, **1980**)\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | Group 5 winner | 30 November 1983 | 0 (debut)\n |\n| ![](image) Yugoslavia | Group 4 winner | 21 December 1983 | 3 (1960, 1968, *1976*)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | Group 7 winner | 21 December 1983 | 2 (***1964***, 1980)\n |\n\n\n1. **^** **Bold** indicates champion for that year. *Italic* indicates host for that year.\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\n### Tournament format[edit]\n\n\nAfter trying out several formats, UEFA finally developed for the 1984 tournament the format that would serve for all subsequent eight-team European Championships.[4] The eight qualified teams were split into two groups of four that played a round-robin schedule. The top two teams of each group advanced to semi-finals (reintroduced after being absent from the 1980 tournament) and the winners advanced to the final. The third place play-off, widely perceived as an unnecessary chore, was dropped. As usual at the time, a win was credited with two points only, teams on equal points were ranked by goal difference instead of head-to-head results, and the sudden-death rule in extra time did not apply.\n\n\nFixtures were scheduled according to an innovative rotation schedule in which each team played its three first-round matches in three different stadia. Host France, for instance, played in Paris, Nantes, and Saint-Étienne. This formula had the advantage of exposing residents of a given city to more teams but implied multiple and sometimes costly trips from town to town for fans who wanted to follow their side. In subsequent championships, the organisers reverted to conventional schedules in which teams played in one or two cities only.\n\n\n\n### Overall impressions[edit]\n\n\nVery few hooligan-related incidents were recorded throughout the tournament. Only one minor instance of fan trouble was recorded, in Strasbourg around the West Germany vs. Portugal match. The small group of German hooligans responsible for the incidents was arrested and deported back to West Germany on the same day using a new law specially passed by the French Parliament ahead of the Euro. Overall, the organisation was flawless,[*citation needed*] a feat that established France's credentials as a host nation and eventually helped it win the right to stage the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nThe entire competition was marked by exceptionally fine weather which, along with the high quality of play throughout the tournament (a welcome change from the 1980 European Championship) and the absence of hooligans, contributed to a very positive and enjoyable experience for teams and fans alike.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe official mascot of this European Championship was **Peno**, a rooster, representing the emblem of the host nation, France. It has the number 84 on the left side of its chest and its outfit is the same as the France national team, blue shirt, white shorts and red socks.\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nFrance's winning bid to host the Euro was based on seven stadia. The 48,000-seat Parc des Princes in Paris was the venue for the opening match and the final. Built in 1972, it was still state-of-the-art in 1984 and needed minor improvements only. Marseille's Stade Vélodrome was expanded to 55,000 seats to host one semi-final and some group matches, becoming France's largest stadium on the occasion. Stade de Gerland in Lyon, the venue for the other semi-final and some group matches as well, was thoroughly renovated and expanded to 40,000. Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Étienne and Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens were the other existing stadia that hosted group matches and were expanded to 53,000 and 49,000, respectively. Lastly, two all-new stadia were built to host group matches (and subsequently provided worthy home grounds for the traditionally strong local club teams): Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes (53,000) was built on an entirely new site while Stade de la Meinau in Strasbourg was rebuilt from the ground up on the site of the old stadium into a modern 40,000-seat arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Paris | Marseille | Lyon |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parc des Princes | Stade Vélodrome | Stade de Gerland |\n| Capacity: **48,360** | Capacity: **55,000** | Capacity: **51,860** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![UEFA Euro 1984 is located in France](image)![Paris](image)\nParis\n![Marseille](image)\nMarseille\n![Lyon](image)\nLyon\n![Saint-Étienne](image)\nSaint-Étienne\n![Lens](image)\nLens\n![Nantes](image)\nNantes\n![Strasbourg](image)\nStrasbourg\n | Saint-Étienne |\n| Stade Geoffroy-Guichard |\n| Capacity: **48,274** |\n| ![](image) |\n| Lens | Nantes | Strasbourg |\n| Stade Félix-Bollaert | Stade de la Beaujoire | Stade de la Meinau |\n| Capacity: **49,000** | Capacity: **52,923** | Capacity: **42,756** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n\n\n## Match officials[edit]\n\n\n* ![Austria](image) Heinz Fahnler\n* ![Belgium](image) Alexis Ponnet\n* ![Czechoslovakia](image) Vojtech Christov\n* ![East Germany](image) Adolf Prokop\n* ![England](image) George Courtney\n* ![France](image) Michel Vautrot\n* ![Italy](image) Paolo Bergamo\n* ![Netherlands](image) Jan Keizer\n* ![Scotland](image) Bob Valentine\n* ![Spain](image) Augusto Lamo Castillo\n* ![Soviet Union](image) Romualdas Juška\n* ![Sweden](image) Erik Fredriksson\n* ![Switzerland](image) André Daina\n* ![West Germany](image) Volker Roth\n\n## Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA Euro 1984 squads\n\nEach national team had to submit a squad of 20 players.\n\n\n\n## Group stage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1984 UEFA European Championship finalists.\nThe teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the two groups progress to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament.\n\n\n*All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).*\n\n\n\n### Tiebreakers[edit]\n\n\nIf two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:\n\n\n\n1.
