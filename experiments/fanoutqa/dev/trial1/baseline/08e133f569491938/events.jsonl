Djokovic defeated Kevin Anderson and Alexander Zverev en route to the title, not dropping a set nor having his serve broken throughout. The win marked his fourth Shanghai title, and his ranking rose to No. 2.[280] On 31 October, Rafael Nadal announced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters due to an abdominal injury, and Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 ranking.[281] There, Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in a tight three-set semifinal, but was upset by the unseeded Karen Khachanov in the final.[282] At the ATP Finals, Djokovic was guaranteed a fifth year-end No. 1 ranking following the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal from the event. In the round-robin stage, he defeated Alexander Zverev, Marin Čilić, and John Isner without dropping a set. In the semifinals, he defeated Kevin Anderson to reach his seventh final at the tournament but was upset by Zverev.[283] At the 2018 Mubadala Championship, he scored victories over Karen Khachanov & Kevin Anderson to win the title.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Event\n | Since\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **ATP/ITF rankings** | 1973\n | Most weeks at world No. 1 (399)[326] | **Stands alone** |\n| 12 different years ranked world No. 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| Most points accumulated as world No. 1 (16,950) | **Stands alone** |\n| Eight-time Year-End world No. 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 1978 | Seven-time ITF World Champion | **Stands alone** |\n| **Grand Slamtournaments** | 1877 | 24 Grand Slam singles titles[418] | **Stands alone** |\n| 1905 | Triple Career Grand Slam[335] | **Stands alone** |\n| 1978 | Champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces | **Stands alone** |\n| 1905 | Non-Calendar Year Grand Slam | Don Budge |\n| 1978 | Surface Slam (major titles across all three different surfaces in a season) | Rafael Nadal |\n| 1877 | 4 streaks of 3+ consecutive majors | **Stands alone** |\n| 4 seasons winning 3 Major titles\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 7 seasons winning multiple Major titles\n | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1992: Jim Courier\n* 1993: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1994: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1995: Thomas Muster\n* 1996: Yevgeny Kafelnikov\n* 1997: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 1998: Carlos Moyá\n* 1999: Andre Agassi\n* 2000: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2001: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2002: Albert Costa\n* 2003: Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* 2004: Gastón Gaudio\n* 2005: Rafael Nadal\n* 2006: Rafael Nadal\n* 2007: Rafael Nadal\n* 2008: Rafael Nadal\n* 2009: Roger Federer\n* 2010: Rafael Nadal\n* 2011: Rafael Nadal\n* 2012: Rafael Nadal\n* 2013: Rafael Nadal\n* 2014: Rafael Nadal\n* 2015: Stan Wawrinka\n* 2016: Novak Djokovic\n* 2017: Rafael Nadal\n* 2018: Rafael Nadal\n* 2019: Rafael Nadal\n* 2020: Rafael Nadal\n* 2021: Novak Djokovic\n* 2022: Rafael Nadal\n* 2023: Novak Djokovic\n* 2024: Carlos Alcaraz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n211. **^** \"Novak Djokovic rolls Rafael Nadal win fourth Sony Open title\".

His next tournament was the Madrid Masters, where he lost to David Nalbandian in the semifinals. Djokovic, assured of finishing the year ranked No. 3, qualified for the year-ending championships, but did not advance beyond the round robin matches. He received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete in Serbia, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia declared him the best athlete in the country.[85]\n\n\nDjokovic played a key role in the 2007 play-off win over Australia by winning all his matches and helping promote the Serbia Davis Cup team to the 2008 World Group.[86] In Serbia's tie against Russia in Moscow in early 2008, Djokovic was sidelined due to influenza and missed his first singles match. He returned to win his doubles match, teaming with Nenad Zimonjić, before retiring during his singles match with Nikolay Davydenko.[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Djokovic during his first round match at the 2007 US Open.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Canadian Open in Montreal, and he defeated No. 3 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Nadal in the semifinals, and No. 1 Federer in the final. This was the first time a player had defeated the top three ranked players in one tournament since Boris Becker in 1994.[82] Djokovic was also only the second player, after Tomáš Berdych, to have defeated both Federer and Nadal since they became the top two players in the world. After this tournament, Björn Borg stated that Djokovic \"is definitely a contender to win a Grand Slam (tournament).\"[83] The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic lost in the second round to Moyà in straight sets. Nevertheless, he went on to reach the final of the US Open, where he had five set points in the first set and two in the second set, but lost them all before losing the match in straight sets to the top-seeded Federer.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"Novak Djokovic will be Serbia's flag bearer at Olympics\". 8 June 2012.

Djokovic then lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters.[130] As the third seed at the US Open, Djokovic came very close to losing in his opening round against Viktor Troicki in extreme heat. He then defeated Philipp Petzschner, James Blake, Mardy Fish, and Gaël Monfils, all in straight sets, to reach the US Open semifinals for the fourth consecutive year. There, he defeated Federer in five sets after saving two match points with forehand winners while serving to stay in the match at 4–5 in the fifth set. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n217. **^** \"Nishikori register historic victory over Djokovic\". 6 September 2014.

He was awarded the title \"Serbian Sportsman of the year\" by the Olympic Committee of Serbia and \"Serbian Athlete of the year\" by DSL Sport.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2011: Rise to the top in one of the greatest seasons in history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNovak Djokovic| ![](image)Djokovic hoisting the 2019 Wimbledon trophy\n |\n| Native name | Новак Ђоковић*Novak Đoković* |\n| Country (sports) | ![](image) Serbia |\n| Residence | Belgrade, Serbia Monte Carlo, Monaco |\n| Born |  (1987-05-22) 22 May 1987 (age 37)Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia(now Serbia) |\n| Height | 1.88 m (6 ft 2 in)[1][2] |\n| Turned pro | 2003 |\n| Plays | Right-handed (two-handed backhand) |\n| Coach | Goran Ivanišević |\n| Prize money | US$176,231,853[3] (All-time leader in earnings) |\n| Official website | novakdjokovic.com |\n| Singles |\n| Career record | 1086–212 (83.7%)[a] |\n| Career titles | 98 (3rd in the Open Era) |\n| Highest ranking | No. **1** (4 July 2011) |\n| Current ranking | **No. 1** (11 September 2023)[4] |\n| Grand Slam singles results |\n| Australian Open | **W** (2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023) |\n| French Open | **W** (2016, 2021, 2023) |\n| Wimbledon | **W** (2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022) |\n| US Open | **W** (2011, 2015, 2018, 2023) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Djokovic out of ATP finals despite win\". www.sportsnet.ca. 27 November 2009.

Due to this result, he lost the No. 1 ranking to Andy Murray.[255] However, a runner-up finish at the ATP Finals indicated his best performances in nearly three months.

At the Australian Open, he won his first four matches in straight sets against Lukáš Lacko, Leonardo Mayer, Denis Istomin, and No. 15 seed Fabio Fognini respectively. He met Wawrinka in the quarterfinals of the tournament, the second consecutive year the two had met at the event. Despite coming back from two sets to one down, Djokovic fell 9–7 in the fifth set, ending his 25–match winning streak in Melbourne, as well as his streak of 14 consecutive Grand Slam tournament semifinals.[210]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Angry Djokovic exacts revenge on Roddick\".

This loss marked Djokovic's first defeat of the season (with Federer also being the last man to defeat Djokovic in 2010), ending a 43-match win streak, which included a 41–0 start to 2011.[143][144] Five weeks later at Wimbledon, Djokovic replaced Nadal as the world No. 1 and then defeated him in a four set final to take his first Wimbledon title.[145][146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter being unable to play in March, Djokovic began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters in April. Seeded first, he received a bye in the first round and lost to eventual finalist Davidovich Fokina in the second, his first opening match loss since the 2018 Barcelona Open.[381][382] Later that month, he reached the final of the Serbia Open and lost to Andrey Rublev in three sets.[383] At the Madrid Open in May, Djokovic made it to the semifinals where he was beaten in three sets by 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, the eventual champion.[384]\nAt the Italian Open a week later, he reached the twelfth final of his career at this Masters. In the semifinals, he defeated Casper Ruud for his 1,000th career win, becoming only the fifth man in the Open Era to reach this milestone.[385] In the final, he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to win his sixth Italian Open and record-extending 38th Masters title.[386]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** \"Djokovic sinks Fish to seal Indian Wells title\".

The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic advanced to the final, beating Nadal in the semifinals, which not only ended the Spaniard's 32-match winning streak, but also delayed Nadal's first ascension to world No. 1 by a week.[97] In the final, he again lost to Murray in straight sets. His next tournament was the 2008 Summer Olympics, his first Olympics. He and Nenad Zimonjić, seeded second in men's doubles, were eliminated in the first round by the Czech pairing of Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner. Seeded third in singles, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Nadal.

With his 22nd Masters title, Djokovic became the first player to complete the Indian Wells – Miami title double three times.[225][226] In April, Djokovic clinched his second Monte-Carlo Masters by beating Tomáš Berdych in the final.[227] Therefore, Djokovic became the first man to win the first three ATP Masters 1000 titles of the season.[228] Djokovic withdrew from the 2015 Madrid Masters.[229] He won the title for the fourth time at the Rome Masters, making it 4 out of 4 titles in Masters events entered by Djokovic in the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the Dubai Championships in February, where vaccination was not required for entry.[377] He was upset in the quarterfinals by eventual finalist Jiří Veselý, resulting in him conceding his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev. This marked the first time a man outside of the Big Four was ranked singles world No. 1 since Andy Roddick in February 2004.[378] Djokovic withdrew from both the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open, due to the United States forbidding unvaccinated foreign travellers.[379] Despite being unable to play, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 ranking after Medvedev's third-round defeat at Indian Wells.[380]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n499. **^** \"Djokovic beats cramping Alcaraz, into French final\". *ESPN.com*. 9 June 2023.

It was his earliest exit in a Grand Slam since the 2009 French Open.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the French Open in May as the defending champion.

Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers. One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.[456] He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments, four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times at the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their most recent final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in what became the longest final in Wimbledon history.[451][452] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[150][453][454]\n\n\n\n### Andy Murray[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a triumphant grass season, Djokovic started his North American hardcourt swing with a third-round showing at the Canadian Open, losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Afterwards, he returned to play the Cincinnati Masters for the first time in three years. In an event plagued by suspended play due to rain, Djokovic defeated the defending champion Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Marin Čilić to reach his sixth final at the tournament and fourth final against Roger Federer. Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title. With this victory, Djokovic became the first (and, as of 2022, only) player in tennis history to complete the Career Golden Masters — winning all nine ATP Masters events at least once in one's career.[278]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** The Men's Player of the Decade: Novak Djokovic Archived 23 July 2023 at the Wayback Machine, Tennis magazine\n9. **^** \"Uncovered: The Best Seasons Of Novak Djokovic's Career\". *ATP Tour*. 31 March 2020.

He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[556] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[557] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[558] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[559]\n\n\n\n### Coaching and personal team[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### 2008: First Major title, two Masters & first Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic started his preparations for the season by playing the Hopman Cup with fellow Serbian world No. 3 Jelena Janković where he won all of his four singles matches, including in the final against the United States, where he beat Mardy Fish in a deciding set tiebreak to level the tie, but then losing the decisive mixed doubles rubber,[88] in which he faced former WTA No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPete Sampras declared Djokovic's 2011 season as the best he had seen in his lifetime, calling it \"one of the best achievements in all of the sports.\"[161] Boris Becker called Djokovic's season \"one of the very best years in tennis of all time\", noting that it \"may not be the best statistically, but he's beaten Federer, he's beaten Nadal, he's beaten everybody that came around to challenge him in the biggest tournaments in the world.\"[162] Rafael Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in six finals on hard, clay and grass courts, described Djokovic's performances as \"probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### 2012: Australian Open title, three Masters & Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the French Open, Djokovic advanced to the final after defeating Rafael Nadal in a four-set semifinal epic.

He won 11 titles including a season-record 10 Big Titles (three Majors, six Masters, and the Year-end Championships) on all court surfaces and conditions (hard, clay, grass and indoors). Djokovic set a season-record of 16,585 for most ranking points accumulated as world No. 1. and had a season-record 31 victories over top-10 players, including a remarkable 15–4 winning record against the other members of the Big Four, Federer, Nadal, and Murray. The 2015 season is Djokovic's most successful season as of 2022, and it is considered one of the greatest seasons in tennis history.[237]\n\n\n\n#### 2016: Historic 'Nole Slam', four Masters & ranking points record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThey met again two months later at the Olympics, with Djokovic winning in straight sets in the quarterfinals.[476] They contested the final of the 2012 China Open, where Djokovic was victorious once again, in straight sets.[477] The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP Finals in which Djokovic prevailed in the first (of three) round robin matches.[478] It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open,[479] which Djokovic won in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev have met 15 times, with Djokovic leading 10–5.[480][481] They have contested three major finals, with Djokovic winning the 2021 Australian Open and the 2023 US Open, and Medvedev winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open, also ending Djokovic's quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam.[482]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to Djokovic's unvaccinated status against COVID-19, he was unable to compete in the US Open as the US government did not allow unvaccinated non-US citizens to enter the country.[393] As a result, he withdrew from the tournament on 25 August.[394] At the Astana Open in October, he defeated Medvedev in the semifinals and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to win his 90th singles title.[395] Djokovic also qualified for the ATP Finals for the 15th time.[396][397]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. However, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[459] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[460][187][188][191][189][461] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[462] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[463]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[639]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. In the quarterfinals, he defeated David Ferrer in three sets. In the semifinal, Djokovic beat Andy Murray in five sets after 4 hours and 50 minutes, recovering from a two-sets-to-one deficit and fending off break points at 5-all in the fifth set.[164] In the final, Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in five sets, recovering from losing the first set and then a break down in the final set to win 7–5. At 5 hours and 53 minutes, the match was the longest Grand Slam final in Open Era history, as well as the longest match in Australian Open history, surpassing the 5-hour and 14-minute 2009 semifinal between Nadal and Fernando Verdasco.[165]\n\n\nDjokovic was beaten by John Isner in the semifinals at Indian Wells. He successfully defended his title in Miami after beating Murray in the final.[166] In the Monte Carlo final, he lost in straight sets to Nadal. Djokovic also lost in straight sets to Nadal at the 2012 Rome Masters final.[167]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n618. **^** Terlato, Peter (12 January 2015). \"Novak Djokovic Has Launched A Social Media Campaign That Will Donate $2 To Charity For Every Post\".

His next tournament was the Madrid Masters, where he lost to David Nalbandian in the semifinals. Djokovic, assured of finishing the year ranked No. 3, qualified for the year-ending championships, but did not advance beyond the round robin matches. He received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete in Serbia, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia declared him the best athlete in the country.[85]\n\n\nDjokovic played a key role in the 2007 play-off win over Australia by winning all his matches and helping promote the Serbia Davis Cup team to the 2008 World Group.[86] In Serbia's tie against Russia in Moscow in early 2008, Djokovic was sidelined due to influenza and missed his first singles match. He returned to win his doubles match, teaming with Nenad Zimonjić, before retiring during his singles match with Nikolay Davydenko.[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Djokovic during his first round match at the 2007 US Open.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Canadian Open in Montreal, and he defeated No. 3 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Nadal in the semifinals, and No. 1 Federer in the final. This was the first time a player had defeated the top three ranked players in one tournament since Boris Becker in 1994.[82] Djokovic was also only the second player, after Tomáš Berdych, to have defeated both Federer and Nadal since they became the top two players in the world. After this tournament, Björn Borg stated that Djokovic \"is definitely a contender to win a Grand Slam (tournament).\"[83] The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic lost in the second round to Moyà in straight sets. Nevertheless, he went on to reach the final of the US Open, where he had five set points in the first set and two in the second set, but lost them all before losing the match in straight sets to the top-seeded Federer.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"Novak Djokovic will be Serbia's flag bearer at Olympics\". 8 June 2012.

This marked Djokovic's eighth win at the Australian Open and 17th Grand Slam title.[302] With the win, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings,[303] and became the first player since Ken Rosewall to win major titles in three different decades, and the first to do so in the Open Era. The match also marked the first time Djokovic came back to win a major final after trailing two sets to one, having lost each of the last seven times this happened.[304] Djokovic then won the title at Dubai Championships for the fifth time, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[305][306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic began his grass court season at the Gerry Weber Open where after the withdrawal of Federer, he competed as the top seed. He advanced to the final, where he lost to Tommy Haas.[109] Djokovic then lost to Haas again, this time in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon.[110] During the US Open Series, Djokovic made the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open in Montreal before losing to Roddick. At the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the semifinals before losing in the final to Federer.[111] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the semifinals, where he was defeated by Federer.[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1938: Don Budge\n* 1939: Don McNeill\n* 1946: Marcel Bernard\n* 1947: József Asbóth\n* 1948: Frank Parker\n* 1949: Frank Parker\n* 1950: Budge Patty\n* 1951: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1952: Jaroslav Drobný\n* 1953: Ken Rosewall\n* 1954: Tony Trabert\n* 1955: Tony Trabert\n* 1956: Lew Hoad\n* 1957: Sven Davidson\n* 1958: Mervyn Rose\n* 1959: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1960: Nicola Pietrangeli\n* 1961: Manuel Santana\n* 1962: Rod Laver\n* 1963: Roy Emerson\n* 1964: Manuel Santana\n* 1965: Fred Stolle\n* 1966: Tony Roche\n* 1967: Roy Emerson\n |\n| Open Era | * 1968: Ken Rosewall\n* 1969: Rod Laver\n* 1970: Jan Kodeš\n* 1971: Jan Kodeš\n* 1972: Andrés Gimeno\n* 1973: Ilie Năstase\n* 1974: Björn Borg\n* 1975: Björn Borg\n* 1976: Adriano Panatta\n* 1977: Guillermo Vilas\n* 1978: Björn Borg\n* 1979: Björn Borg\n* 1980: Björn Borg\n* 1981: Björn Borg\n* 1982: Mats Wilander\n* 1983: Yannick Noah\n* 1984: Ivan Lendl\n* 1985: Mats Wilander\n* 1986: Ivan Lendl\n* 1987: Ivan Lendl\n* 1988: Mats Wilander\n* 1989: Michael Chang\n* 1990: Andrés Gómez\n* 1991: Jim Courier\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Other tournaments |\n| Tour Finals | **W** (2008, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2022, 2023) |\n| Olympic Games | ![](image) (2008) |\n| Doubles |\n| Career record | 63–79 (44.4%)[b] |\n| Career titles | 1 |\n| Highest ranking | No. 114 (30 November 2009)[5] |\n| Grand Slam doubles results |\n| Australian Open | 1R (2006, 2007) |\n| French Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Wimbledon | 2R (2006) |\n| US Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Other doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | 2R (2016) |\n| Other mixed doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | SF – 4th (2020) |\n| Team competitions |\n| Davis Cup | **W** (2010) |\n| Hopman Cup | F (2008, 2013) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| President of the ATP Player Council |\n| **In office**30 August 2016 – 30 August 2020 |\n| Vice President | Kevin Anderson |\n| Preceded by | Eric Butorac |\n| Succeeded by | Kevin Anderson |\n|  |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Last updated on: 20 November 2023. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by reaching the final without dropping a set in the first five rounds, including a quarterfinal clash with Nadal and a five-set semifinal victory over No. 3 seed Andy Murray which took two days to complete. This meant he became only the second man to have won against Nadal at the French Open. However, he lost the next match and the tournament to No. 8 seed Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[230] Five weeks later, he rebounded again from the tough loss in Paris, just like 2014, coming from two sets down to beat Kevin Anderson in the fourth round, and then going on to claim his third Wimbledon title, with a four-set win over Roger Federer.[231]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Novak Djokovic (Achievement predecessor & successor)\n |\n| --- |\n| | Sporting positions\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal Roger FedererRafael NadalRafael NadalRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos Alcaraz\n |  **World No. 1** July 4, 2011 – July 8, 2012November 5, 2012 – October 6, 2013July 7, 2014 – November 6, 2016November 5, 2018 – November 5, 2019February 3, 2020 – Feb 28, 2022Mar 21, 2022 – Jun 12, 2022Jan 30, 2023 – Mar 19, 2023Apr 3, 2023 – May 21, 2023Jun 12, 2023 – Jun 25, 2023Sep 11, 2023 – Jun 10, 2024\n | Succeeded byRoger Federer Rafael NadalAndy MurrayRafael NadalDaniil MedvedevDaniil MedvedevCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazCarlos AlcarazJannik Sinner\n |\n| Preceded byMardy Fish\n |  **US Open Series Champion** 2012 | Succeeded byRafael Nadal\n |\n| Awards\n |\n| Preceded byRafael Nadal\n |  **ATP Most Improved Player** 2006, 2007 | Succeeded byJo-Wilfried Tsonga\n |\n| Preceded byOlivera JevtićNađa HiglDavor Štefanek\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n430. **^** \"Novak Djokovic Continues Big Titles Dominance With US Open Victory\". *ATP Tour*. 10 September 2023.

In April, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to David Goffin. After the tournament, he chose to split with his long-time coach Marián Vajda, fitness specialist Gebhard Phil-Gritsch, and physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, citing the need to find a winning spark. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n135. **^** Schlink, Leo (30 January 2011). \"Novak Djokovic wins in straight sets\". *heraldsun.com.au*.

Djokovic then lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters.[130] As the third seed at the US Open, Djokovic came very close to losing in his opening round against Viktor Troicki in extreme heat. He then defeated Philipp Petzschner, James Blake, Mardy Fish, and Gaël Monfils, all in straight sets, to reach the US Open semifinals for the fourth consecutive year. There, he defeated Federer in five sets after saving two match points with forehand winners while serving to stay in the match at 4–5 in the fifth set. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n217. **^** \"Nishikori register historic victory over Djokovic\". 6 September 2014.

He was awarded the title \"Serbian Sportsman of the year\" by the Olympic Committee of Serbia and \"Serbian Athlete of the year\" by DSL Sport.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2011: Rise to the top in one of the greatest seasons in history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNovak Djokovic| ![](image)Djokovic hoisting the 2019 Wimbledon trophy\n |\n| Native name | Новак Ђоковић*Novak Đoković* |\n| Country (sports) | ![](image) Serbia |\n| Residence | Belgrade, Serbia Monte Carlo, Monaco |\n| Born |  (1987-05-22) 22 May 1987 (age 37)Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia(now Serbia) |\n| Height | 1.88 m (6 ft 2 in)[1][2] |\n| Turned pro | 2003 |\n| Plays | Right-handed (two-handed backhand) |\n| Coach | Goran Ivanišević |\n| Prize money | US$176,231,853[3] (All-time leader in earnings) |\n| Official website | novakdjokovic.com |\n| Singles |\n| Career record | 1086–212 (83.7%)[a] |\n| Career titles | 98 (3rd in the Open Era) |\n| Highest ranking | No. **1** (4 July 2011) |\n| Current ranking | **No. 1** (11 September 2023)[4] |\n| Grand Slam singles results |\n| Australian Open | **W** (2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2023) |\n| French Open | **W** (2016, 2021, 2023) |\n| Wimbledon | **W** (2011, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022) |\n| US Open | **W** (2011, 2015, 2018, 2023) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Djokovic out of ATP finals despite win\". www.sportsnet.ca. 27 November 2009.

Due to this result, he lost the No. 1 ranking to Andy Murray.[255] However, a runner-up finish at the ATP Finals indicated his best performances in nearly three months.

At the Australian Open, he won his first four matches in straight sets against Lukáš Lacko, Leonardo Mayer, Denis Istomin, and No. 15 seed Fabio Fognini respectively. He met Wawrinka in the quarterfinals of the tournament, the second consecutive year the two had met at the event. Despite coming back from two sets to one down, Djokovic fell 9–7 in the fifth set, ending his 25–match winning streak in Melbourne, as well as his streak of 14 consecutive Grand Slam tournament semifinals.[210]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Angry Djokovic exacts revenge on Roddick\".

This loss marked Djokovic's first defeat of the season (with Federer also being the last man to defeat Djokovic in 2010), ending a 43-match win streak, which included a 41–0 start to 2011.[143][144] Five weeks later at Wimbledon, Djokovic replaced Nadal as the world No. 1 and then defeated him in a four set final to take his first Wimbledon title.[145][146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter being unable to play in March, Djokovic began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters in April. Seeded first, he received a bye in the first round and lost to eventual finalist Davidovich Fokina in the second, his first opening match loss since the 2018 Barcelona Open.[381][382] Later that month, he reached the final of the Serbia Open and lost to Andrey Rublev in three sets.[383] At the Madrid Open in May, Djokovic made it to the semifinals where he was beaten in three sets by 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, the eventual champion.[384]\nAt the Italian Open a week later, he reached the twelfth final of his career at this Masters. In the semifinals, he defeated Casper Ruud for his 1,000th career win, becoming only the fifth man in the Open Era to reach this milestone.[385] In the final, he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to win his sixth Italian Open and record-extending 38th Masters title.[386]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** \"Djokovic sinks Fish to seal Indian Wells title\".

The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic advanced to the final, beating Nadal in the semifinals, which not only ended the Spaniard's 32-match winning streak, but also delayed Nadal's first ascension to world No. 1 by a week.[97] In the final, he again lost to Murray in straight sets. His next tournament was the 2008 Summer Olympics, his first Olympics. He and Nenad Zimonjić, seeded second in men's doubles, were eliminated in the first round by the Czech pairing of Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner. Seeded third in singles, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Nadal.

With his 22nd Masters title, Djokovic became the first player to complete the Indian Wells – Miami title double three times.[225][226] In April, Djokovic clinched his second Monte-Carlo Masters by beating Tomáš Berdych in the final.[227] Therefore, Djokovic became the first man to win the first three ATP Masters 1000 titles of the season.[228] Djokovic withdrew from the 2015 Madrid Masters.[229] He won the title for the fourth time at the Rome Masters, making it 4 out of 4 titles in Masters events entered by Djokovic in the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the Dubai Championships in February, where vaccination was not required for entry.[377] He was upset in the quarterfinals by eventual finalist Jiří Veselý, resulting in him conceding his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev. This marked the first time a man outside of the Big Four was ranked singles world No. 1 since Andy Roddick in February 2004.[378] Djokovic withdrew from both the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open, due to the United States forbidding unvaccinated foreign travellers.[379] Despite being unable to play, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 ranking after Medvedev's third-round defeat at Indian Wells.[380]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n499. **^** \"Djokovic beats cramping Alcaraz, into French final\". *ESPN.com*. 9 June 2023.

It was his earliest exit in a Grand Slam since the 2009 French Open.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic entered the French Open in May as the defending champion.

Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers. One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.[456] He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments, four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times at the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their most recent final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in what became the longest final in Wimbledon history.[451][452] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[150][453][454]\n\n\n\n### Andy Murray[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a triumphant grass season, Djokovic started his North American hardcourt swing with a third-round showing at the Canadian Open, losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Afterwards, he returned to play the Cincinnati Masters for the first time in three years. In an event plagued by suspended play due to rain, Djokovic defeated the defending champion Grigor Dimitrov, Milos Raonic, and Marin Čilić to reach his sixth final at the tournament and fourth final against Roger Federer. Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title. With this victory, Djokovic became the first (and, as of 2022, only) player in tennis history to complete the Career Golden Masters — winning all nine ATP Masters events at least once in one's career.[278]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** The Men's Player of the Decade: Novak Djokovic Archived 23 July 2023 at the Wayback Machine, Tennis magazine\n9. **^** \"Uncovered: The Best Seasons Of Novak Djokovic's Career\". *ATP Tour*. 31 March 2020.

He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[556] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[557] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[558] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[559]\n\n\n\n### Coaching and personal team[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### 2008: First Major title, two Masters & first Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic started his preparations for the season by playing the Hopman Cup with fellow Serbian world No. 3 Jelena Janković where he won all of his four singles matches, including in the final against the United States, where he beat Mardy Fish in a deciding set tiebreak to level the tie, but then losing the decisive mixed doubles rubber,[88] in which he faced former WTA No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPete Sampras declared Djokovic's 2011 season as the best he had seen in his lifetime, calling it \"one of the best achievements in all of the sports.\"[161] Boris Becker called Djokovic's season \"one of the very best years in tennis of all time\", noting that it \"may not be the best statistically, but he's beaten Federer, he's beaten Nadal, he's beaten everybody that came around to challenge him in the biggest tournaments in the world.\"[162] Rafael Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in six finals on hard, clay and grass courts, described Djokovic's performances as \"probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### 2012: Australian Open title, three Masters & Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the French Open, Djokovic advanced to the final after defeating Rafael Nadal in a four-set semifinal epic.

Djokovic set a season-record of 16,585 for most ranking points accumulated as world No. 1. and had a season-record 31 victories over top-10 players, including a remarkable 15–4 winning record against the other members of the Big Four, Federer, Nadal, and Murray. The 2015 season is Djokovic's most successful season as of 2022, and it is considered one of the greatest seasons in tennis history.[237]\n\n\n\n#### 2016: Historic 'Nole Slam', four Masters & ranking points record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThey met again two months later at the Olympics, with Djokovic winning in straight sets in the quarterfinals.[476] They contested the final of the 2012 China Open, where Djokovic was victorious once again, in straight sets.[477] The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP Finals in which Djokovic prevailed in the first (of three) round robin matches.[478] It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open,[479] which Djokovic won in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev have met 15 times, with Djokovic leading 10–5.[480][481] They have contested three major finals, with Djokovic winning the 2021 Australian Open and the 2023 US Open, and Medvedev winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open, also ending Djokovic's quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam.[482]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to Djokovic's unvaccinated status against COVID-19, he was unable to compete in the US Open as the US government did not allow unvaccinated non-US citizens to enter the country.[393] As a result, he withdrew from the tournament on 25 August.[394] At the Astana Open in October, he defeated Medvedev in the semifinals and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to win his 90th singles title.[395] Djokovic also qualified for the ATP Finals for the 15th time.[396][397]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. However, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[459] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[460][187][188][191][189][461] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[462] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[463]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[639]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. In the quarterfinals, he defeated David Ferrer in three sets. In the semifinal, Djokovic beat Andy Murray in five sets after 4 hours and 50 minutes, recovering from a two-sets-to-one deficit and fending off break points at 5-all in the fifth set.[164] In the final, Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in five sets, recovering from losing the first set and then a break down in the final set to win 7–5. At 5 hours and 53 minutes, the match was the longest Grand Slam final in Open Era history, as well as the longest match in Australian Open history, surpassing the 5-hour and 14-minute 2009 semifinal between Nadal and Fernando Verdasco.[165]\n\n\nDjokovic was beaten by John Isner in the semifinals at Indian Wells. He successfully defended his title in Miami after beating Murray in the final.[166] In the Monte Carlo final, he lost in straight sets to Nadal. Djokovic also lost in straight sets to Nadal at the 2012 Rome Masters final.[167]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n618. **^** Terlato, Peter (12 January 2015). \"Novak Djokovic Has Launched A Social Media Campaign That Will Donate $2 To Charity For Every Post\".

The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

Alcaraz has won twelve ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and four Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\nAs a junior, Alcaraz was ranked as high as world No. 22 and won two titles on the ITF Junior Circuit. After turning professional in 2018, he won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour and broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021. Two months later, Alcaraz won his first ATP title at the Croatia Open, an ATP 250 tournament. He later entered the top 50 after reaching the quarterfinals at the following US Open and won the year end Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan. After winning his first ATP 500 title at the Rio Open in February 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open and his second ATP 500 title at the Barcelona Open in April, propelling him into the top 10. In September 2022, Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the US Open final to win his first major singles title. In May 2023, he was awarded the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. In July 2023, Alcaraz won Wimbledon, defeating seven-time and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final to claim his second major singles title. \n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz Garfia was born on 5 May 2003, in El Palmar, Murcia, Spain, to parents Carlos Alcaraz González and Virginia Garfia Escandón. He has three siblings.\n\n\nAlcaraz started playing tennis at the age of four at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia (Royal Society Murciashire Club), where his father was the tennis academy director. Alcaraz' father was a former professional player, but stopped playing when he couldn't afford to any longer. In 2018, he moved to Villena to begin training at Juan Carlos Ferrero's Equelite JC Ferrero Sport Academy.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: ATP debut[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, at the age of 16, Alcaraz made his ATP main-draw debut at the Rio Open after receiving a wildcard for the singles main draw. There, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas.[10] Alcaraz was defeated in the second round by Federico Coria.\n\n\n\n### 2021: First title, Next-Gen Finals champion, top 35[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2021 French Open\nAt age 17, Alcaraz made it to the main draw of the Australian Open, making him the youngest participant in the men's singles.[11] He won his Grand Slam tournament debut defeating fellow qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets before losing in the second round to Mikael Ymer.[12]\n\n\nAlcaraz became the youngest match winner in the Madrid Open's history, defeating Adrian Mannarino as a wildcard and breaking then-18-year-old Rafael Nadal's record from 2004. In the second round, he lost to five-time champion Nadal on Alcaraz's 18th birthday.[13][14][15]\nBy winning the biggest title of his career until then at the 2021 Open de Oeiras III Challenger tournament, he entered the top 100 as the youngest player at the age of 18 on 24 May 2021.[16][17]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Alcaraz reached the third round of a major for the first time in his career by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili.\n\n\nIn July 2021, he reached his first ATP final at the 2021 Croatia Open Umag, defeating top seed Albert Ramos Viñolas.[18] He then won his maiden ATP title by defeating Richard Gasquet and becoming the youngest tour-level champion since 18-year-old Kei Nishikori won the Delray Beach Open in 2008. Alcaraz was the youngest Spaniard to win an ATP Tour title since Nadal claimed his first trophy in Sopot in 2004.[19]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Daniil Medvedev. At the Winston-Salem Open, Alcaraz reached the round of 16 defeating qualifier Alexei Popyrin, and his second tour-level quarterfinal of the season defeating fourth seed Márton Fucsovics.[20] He defeated Marcos Giron to reach the semifinals,[21] where he lost to Mikael Ymer.\n\n\nAt the US Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth-set tiebreak to reach the fourth round in the biggest win of his career.[22] At 18 years of age, Alcaraz became the youngest man in a major fourth round since 17-year-old Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open, and the youngest man in the US Open fourth round since 17-year-old Michael Chang and 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1989.[23][24] He then reached the quarterfinals by defeating qualifier Peter Gojowczyk. Alcaraz became the youngest US Open men's quarterfinalist in the Open Era, the youngest at the tournament since 18-year-old Thomaz Koch in 1963, and the youngest Grand Slam tournament men's singles quarterfinalist since 18-year-old Michael Chang at the 1990 French Open. He then lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime via retirement in the second set in the quarterfinals after injuring his leg.[25]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini, his second win over a top-10 player,[26] and became the youngest player in the top 35 on 1 November. During his Paris Masters run, Alcaraz defeated French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in three thrilling sets in the first round.[27] He then defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the second round, his third win over a top-10 player.[28] In the third round, he was defeated by Hugo Gaston in straight sets.[29]\n\n\nAt the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz defeated Brandon Nakashima, Juan Manuel Cerúndolo, and Holger Rune in the round-robin stage. He beat Sebastian Baez in the semifinal, and Sebastian Korda in the final.[30][31][32][33]\n\n\n\n### 2022: First major, youngest world No. 1, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\nSeeded for the first time in a major at No. 31, Alcaraz reached the third round of the Australian Open before losing in five sets to Matteo Berrettini.[34]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the Rio Open, Alcaraz won his first ATP 500 title by defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[35] He entered the top 20 in the singles rankings on 21 February 2022. In Indian Wells, Alcaraz reached his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal and semifinal, defeating defending champion Cameron Norrie before losing to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\nSeeded 14th at the Miami Open, Alcaraz defeated 6th seed Casper Ruud to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest men's champion in the tournament's history and the third-youngest ATP Masters 1000 titlist in history.[36]\n\n\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz lost in the second round to Sebastian Korda.[37] At the Barcelona Open, Alcaraz defeated top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals[38] to enter the top 10 in rankings for the first time on 25 April.[39][40] He became the 20th teen to break into top 10 overall since rankings were established in 1973, and the youngest since Rafael Nadal also on 25 April 2005.[41][42] Alcaraz later defeated Pablo Carreño Busta to win the title.[43]\n\n\nA day after his 19th birthday at the Madrid Open, he defeated 5-time Madrid champion, world No. 4 and third seed Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to become the first teenager to defeat him on clay.[44] The following day, he beat the world No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for his 6th straight top-10 win, and became the youngest player to win a match against a world No. 1 since 2004. He also became the first player to ever beat Djokovic and Nadal back-to-back on clay.[36][45][46] In the final, he won his fourth title for the season (and second Masters 1000), by defeating defending champion and world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, thereby defeating the top three seeds in three consecutive matches. He also became the youngest champion in tournament history.[47] As a result, he climbed to a career-high of world No. 6 in the rankings on 9 May 2022.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships\nFollowing his withdrawal from the Italian Open due to an ankle injury,[49] Alcaraz made his seeded debut at the French Open as No. 6. Having won two of the tour's biggest titles on clay coming into the Slam, he was widely projected to be one of the favorites for the title.[50] He defeated Juan Ignacio Londero in straight sets before saving a match point in a second round five-setter against Albert Ramos Viñolas.[51][52] He then defeated Korda and Karen Khachanov in straight sets before losing to Zverev, in the second major quarterfinal of his career.[53][54][55]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Alcaraz beat Jan-Lennard Struff in a close five set match before defeating Tallon Griekspoor and Oscar Otte in straight sets, reaching the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the fourth round.\n\n\nAt the Hamburg Open, he reached the final, resulting in a new career-high of world No. 5 on 25 July 2022. Alcaraz became the youngest player to enter the top 5 in rankings since Nadal in 2005.[56][57] He was defeated in the final by Lorenzo Musetti, resulting in the first loss in a tournament final of his career.[58] At the Croatia Open, he reached his second consecutive final, resulting in another ranking jump to world No. 4 on 1 August.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evolution of Carlos Alcaraz compared to the \"Big Three\" in the ATP RANKING from 17 to 20 years old, on the left the starting ranking and the names of the players can be seen, and the highest ranking reached in the period are on the right.\nAlcaraz entered the 2022 US Open as the No. 3 seed.[61] He defeated Sebastian Baez, Federico Coria and Jenson Brooksby without dropping a set to reach the fourth round.[62] Next he defeated 15th seed Marin Čilić in five sets, becoming the youngest man to reach back-to-back quarterfinals at this Major in the Open Era.[63] In his quarterfinal match he defeated Jannik Sinner, saving a match point in the fourth set. The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia. In December 2010, he won his first junior title as a qualifier at just his third tournament.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n2012–2013 would see Medvedev surge on the junior circuit as he won six titles between October 2012 and July 2013 which included four consecutive titles. He made his junior Grand Slam debut at 2013 Junior Wimbledon where he won his first round match against Hong Seong-chan but lost in the second round to 2nd seed Nikola Milojević. At the 2013 Junior US Open, he went into the tournament seeded 10th and made the third round where he lost to Johan Tatlot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev reached his career-high junior ranking of world No. 13 at the beginning of 2014 and went into the 2014 Junior Australian Open seeded 8th. He ended his junior career after a first round loss at 2014 Junior Wimbledon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev ended his junior career with an overall win–loss record of 109–43 and wins over several future stars including Alexander Zverev and Reilly Opelka.[26]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nWimbledon: 2R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: 3R (2013)\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016 Early pro career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev made his ATP main draw debut at the 2015 Kremlin Cup, partnering Aslan Karatsev in the doubles event. The two defeated Aliaksandr Bury and Denis Istomin in the first round but were defeated by Radu Albot and František Čermák in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2015 Nice Open\nAs a qualifier, Medvedev made his ATP singles main draw debut at the 2016 Nice Open, losing to Guido Pella in three sets. Three weeks later he earned his first singles ATP World Tour win at the 2016 Ricoh Open, defeating Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high. In February, he advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Open Sud de France and the Open 13, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille respectively.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June, he made it to the quarterfinals of the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, defeating the 6th seed, Robin Haase, and Thanasi Kokkinakis before losing to Ivo Karlović in straight sets. At the Aegon Championships, he advanced to his first ATP 500 quarterfinal by beating Nicolas Mahut and Kokkinakis in the first two rounds, before losing to the No. 6 seed, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarterfinals. One week later, he on grass advanced to the semifinal of Eastbourne International, losing to Novak Djokovic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev registered his maiden Grand Slam match win at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, defeating fifth seed and world No. 3, Stan Wawrinka, in the first round in four sets.[29] He lost in the next round to Ruben Bemelmans.[30] Medvedev was handed three fines totaling $14,500 (£11,200) for his conduct during the match with Bemelmans: $7,000 for insulting the umpire on two occasions and $7,500 for throwing coins under the umpire's chair.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev serving at the 2017 Queen's Club Championships\n### 2018 First ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the 2018 season by qualifying for the Sydney International. He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final. This triumph brought him to a new career high ranking of No. 22 and made him the No. 1 player in Russia. The victory also marked the third consecutive final that Medvedev had beaten the home favorite in to win the title. Medvedev reached the Kremlin Cup semifinal, losing to his countryman and eventual champion Karen Khachanov. One week later, he made the semifinals at the ATP 500 Swiss Indoors event, which he lost to Roger Federer. After the tournament, he achieved a new career high ranking of world No. 16.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev finished 2018 with the most hard court match wins of any player on the ATP Tour (38 wins). He also had the most titles on hard court tournaments (3 titles), tying with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Karen Khachanov.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Two Masters titles, US Open final[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the season strongly by reaching the final of the Brisbane International, defeating Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route, but then lost to Kei Nishikori.[34] At the Australian Open, he was seeded 15th, the first time he was seeded at a major. He reached the round of 16 for the first time in his career, where he was defeated by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.[35] In February, Medvedev won his fourth ATP title at the Sofia Open, beating Márton Fucsovics in the final.[36] The following week, Medvedev lost in the semifinals of Rotterdam to Gaël Monfils. Medvedev entered the Monte Carlo Masters having only won two of his 13 career matches on clay courts. Despite this, he reached his first ever Masters 1000 quarterfinal at the event after defeating world No. 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[37] In the quarterfinals, Medvedev earned his first triumph over a world number 1 ranked player, when he defeated Djokovic in three sets.[38] His run ended in the semifinals against Dušan Lajović.[39] At the Barcelona Open, Medvedev earned his third successive top 10 victory (this time over Kei Nishikori) to reach his first clay-court final.[40] There, he was defeated by world No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[41] Following his victory over Nishikori, Medvedev experienced a five-match losing streak, including an opening-round defeat at the French Open. He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov. In the final, he was defeated by defending champion Rafael Nadal. Medvedev would reach a second consecutive Masters final at Cincinnati after beating defending champion Djokovic for the second time, where he defeated David Goffin in straight sets for his first Masters title.[43]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the US Open as the world No. 5.[44] In his second round match, he fought off cramping to defeat Hugo Dellien in four sets.[45] He then defeated Feliciano López in a contentious match for which he was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $4,000 for flipping off the crowd.[46][47] Medvedev next recovered from a set and a break deficit to beat Dominik Köpfer and reach his first Major quarterfinal.[48] He then beat former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals to reach his first Grand Slam final.[49][50] There, Medvedev was defeated by Rafael Nadal in five sets.[51]\n\n\nMedvedev followed up his success in North America with his maiden title on Russian soil at the St. Petersburg Open, to become the first Russian to win the tournament in 15 years.[52][53] Medvedev then won a second consecutive title at the Shanghai Masters, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.[54] By reaching the final, Medvedev became the 7th man since 2000 to reach at least nine finals in a season.[55][56][57] He ended the season losing his last four matches, including all three round robin matches in his ATP Finals debut.\n\n\n\n### 2020 ATP Finals champion, third Masters title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2020 Australian Open\nMedvedev opened his season at the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup as Russia's top ranked singles player. He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles. This included 3 top ten victories (over Diego Schwartzman, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini) extending his win streak over top 10 opponents to ten wins.[65] Medvedev then reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open after straight sets victories over Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, extending his win streak against top 10 opponents to twelve wins, and his overall win streak to twenty wins. In the final, he was defeated by the defending champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[66]\n\n\nMedvedev won his first title of the season at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final.[67] With the win, Medvedev ascended to world number 2 in the ATP rankings, becoming the first man outside of the Big Four to occupy a position in the top 2 since Lleyton Hewitt in July 2005.[68] On 13 April, Medvedev tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters.[69] At the French Open, Medvedev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the grass-court season, Medvedev took a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Championships, where he won his first career grass-court title. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev was upset in the fourth round by Grigor Dimitrov.[81] At the Paris Masters, Medvedev reached the final for the second consecutive year, but lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[82] In his third ATP Finals, Medvedev qualified for the semifinals after winning all of his group matches. He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev represented Russia in the third edition of the ATP Cup. Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. In the final, he was defeated in five epic sets by Rafael Nadal despite taking a two-set lead. At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios. At the Cincinnati Masters, Medvedev was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semifinals. Medvedev was yet again defeated by Kyrgios at the US Open, resulting in Medvedev losing his number one ranking.[105]\n\n\nMedvedev began the fall indoor-hardcourt season by competing at the Moselle Open, where he lost his opening match to Stan Wawrinka in three sets. Medvedev next competed at the Astana Open where he reached the semifinals. In his semifinal match, against Novak Djokovic, Medvedev was forced to retire with the match level at one-set-all with a leg injury.[106][107] Medvedev returned to play at the Vienna Open where he defeated Denis Shapovalov in the final to win his second title of the year, and second ATP 500 title of his career.[108] Medvedev finished the year on a 4 match losing skid, losing in the opening round in Paris Masters, and losing all three of his round robin matches in the ATP Finals in third-set tiebreakers. This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round. As a result, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 to World No. 12.\n\n\nIn February, Medvedev entered the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam seeded 6th, where he made it to the finals whilst dropping only one set. In the final, he defeated Italian No. 1 Jannik Sinner in three sets,[110] thus returning back to the Top 10. The following week, Medvedev entered the Qatar ExxonMobil Open seeded third and won the tournament, defeating Andy Murray in straight sets in the final.\n\n\nIn March, Medvedev defeated No. 2 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets in an all-Russian final to win in Dubai his third title in three weeks,[111] and his 18th title overall thus winning titles in 18 different cities and becoming the first man in the Open Era to accomplish the feat.[112] In this tournament, he did not drop a set including his win against No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic, snapping his 20-match winning streak.[113] As a result he moved back to world No. 6 on 6 March 2023.\n\n\nAt the next Masters 1000 Indian Wells Masters he reached back-to-back quarterfinals defeating 12th seed Alexander Zverev. His victories against 23rd seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and 14h seed Frances Tiafoe propelled him into the final.[114] In the final, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets but reentered the Top 5.[115] In Miami he reached back-to-back finals defeating 14th seed Karen Khachanov and won his 19th title in a 19th different city defeating tenth seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets. He moved to world No. 4 in the rankings on 3 April 2023.[116]\n\n\nMedvedev began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he reached his sixth consecutive quarterfinal with wins over Lorenzo Sonego and 13th seed Alexander Zverev but he lost to sixth seed Holger Rune in the quarterfinals, ending his streak of five consecutive finals.\nAt the next Masters in Madrid he recorded his 300th win over first-time qualifier and compatriot Alexander Shevchenko in the third round.[117] He lost to qualifier, another compatriot Aslan Karatsev in the fourth round. In Rome he reached the semifinals at a Masters 1000 clay-court event for just the second time (after Monte-Carlo 2019) defeating qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.[118] Next he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach only his second final on clay. He won his first clay title defeating Holger Rune, having won 20 titles in 20 different cities. As a result he returned to world No. 2 in the singles rankings on 22 May 2023.[119] Medvedev entered the French Open as the second seed but lost in his first round match against Thiago Seyboth Wild.\n\n\nAt the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, he was seeded 3rd and reached the semifinals for the first time at this Major. Following wins over wildcard Arthur Fery, Adrian Mannarino, Márton Fucsovics, Jiří Lehečka, and Christopher Eubanks in a tight five set match, he set up a semifinal clash with Carlos Alcaraz but lost in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the US Summer Hard Court Swing, Medvedev made the quarterfinals at the Rogers Cup and reached the fourth round at the Cincinnati Masters, losing to Alex De Minaur and Alexander Zverev respectively.[120] Next, at the 2023 US Open, he reached the final following wins over Attila Balazs, Christopher O'Connell, Sebastian Baez, Alex De Minaur, fellow countryman Andrey Rublev, and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals to set up a rematch of the 2021 final with Novak Djokovic. Djokovic won in straight sets on Sunday, September 10. Due to his US Open run, he was the third player to qualify for the 2023 ATP Finals on September 5.[121]\n\n\nAt the Asian Swing, Medvedev reached the final of the China Open where he lost Jannik Sinner straight sets. [122] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he recorded his 60th win of the season to reach the third round over Cristian Garin, after Carlos Alcaraz did the same.[123]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nDaniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches. He also has been employed as an ambassador by BMW, Tinkoff Bank, and HyperX for gaming accessories, mostly for the Russian-speaking world. He was previously endorsed by Lotto for apparel and shoes until 2019.[134][135] Since November 2021, he has been signed as a promoter of the Guojiao 1573 brand.[136]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daniil Medvedev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 1R | 2R | 4R | 4R | F | F | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 21–7\n | 75%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | 1R | 1R | 1R | 1R | QF | 4R | 1R |  | 0 / 7\n | 7–7\n | 50%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q3 | 2R | 3R | 3R | NH\n | 4R | A[a] | SF |  | 0 / 5\n | 13–5\n | 72%\n |\n| US Open | Q1 | 1R | 3R | F | SF | **W** | 4R | F |  | 1 / 7\n | 29–6\n | 83%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–4\n | 5–4\n | 11–4\n | 8–3\n | 20–3\n | 12–3\n | 13–4\n |  | 1 / 26\n | 70–25\n | 74%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Finals: 5 (1 title, 4 runners-ups)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2019 | US Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 5–7, 3–6, 7–5, 6–4, 4–6\n |\n| Loss | 2021 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 5–7, 2–6, 2–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| Loss | 2022 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 6–2, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 4–6, 5–7 |\n| Loss | 2023 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 6–7(5–7), 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2020 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 4–6, 7–6(7–2), 6–4\n |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 4–6, 4–6\n |\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n* These records were attained in the Open Era.\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | 4 consecutive finals of the North American swing/US Open Series | Ivan LendlAndre Agassi[42] |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 in one tournament | Boris BeckerNovak DjokovicDavid Nalbandian |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 to win the ATP Finals | **Stands alone**[138] |\n| 2021\n | Winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season | Andrey RublevFélix Auger-Aliassime |\n| 2021\n | Undefeated winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 2021\n | Tallest Grand Slam champion (6'6\" – 2021 US Open) | Juan Martín del PotroMarin Čilić[139] |\n| 2022\n | Tallest World number 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 2023\n | Winner of his first 20 tour-level titles in 20 different cities | **Stands alone**[140] |\n| 2023\n | Winner of both the Miami Open and Italian Open in the same season\n | Andre AgassiNovak Djokovic |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Medvedev's parents, Sergey and Olga in 2019, receive the Russian Cup[141] |\n\n\nNational\n* The Russian Cup in the nominations:\n\t+ Male Tennis Player of the Year: 2019, 2021;\n\t+ Team of the Year: 2019, 2021.[141]\n* ![](image) Sports title \"Merited Master of Sports of Russia\" (2019)[142]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Russian athletes were banned from competing following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[137][94]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev\". *ATP World Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia. In December 2010, he won his first junior title as a qualifier at just his third tournament.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n2012–2013 would see Medvedev surge on the junior circuit as he won six titles between October 2012 and July 2013 which included four consecutive titles. He made his junior Grand Slam debut at 2013 Junior Wimbledon where he won his first round match against Hong Seong-chan but lost in the second round to 2nd seed Nikola Milojević. At the 2013 Junior US Open, he went into the tournament seeded 10th and made the third round where he lost to Johan Tatlot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev reached his career-high junior ranking of world No. 13 at the beginning of 2014 and went into the 2014 Junior Australian Open seeded 8th. He ended his junior career after a first round loss at 2014 Junior Wimbledon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev ended his junior career with an overall win–loss record of 109–43 and wins over several future stars including Alexander Zverev and Reilly Opelka.[26]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nWimbledon: 2R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: 3R (2013)\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016 Early pro career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev made his ATP main draw debut at the 2015 Kremlin Cup, partnering Aslan Karatsev in the doubles event. The two defeated Aliaksandr Bury and Denis Istomin in the first round but were defeated by Radu Albot and František Čermák in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2015 Nice Open\nAs a qualifier, Medvedev made his ATP singles main draw debut at the 2016 Nice Open, losing to Guido Pella in three sets. Three weeks later he earned his first singles ATP World Tour win at the 2016 Ricoh Open, defeating Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high. In February, he advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Open Sud de France and the Open 13, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille respectively.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June, he made it to the quarterfinals of the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, defeating the 6th seed, Robin Haase, and Thanasi Kokkinakis before losing to Ivo Karlović in straight sets. At the Aegon Championships, he advanced to his first ATP 500 quarterfinal by beating Nicolas Mahut and Kokkinakis in the first two rounds, before losing to the No. 6 seed, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarterfinals. One week later, he on grass advanced to the semifinal of Eastbourne International, losing to Novak Djokovic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev registered his maiden Grand Slam match win at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, defeating fifth seed and world No. 3, Stan Wawrinka, in the first round in four sets.[29] He lost in the next round to Ruben Bemelmans.[30] Medvedev was handed three fines totaling $14,500 (£11,200) for his conduct during the match with Bemelmans: $7,000 for insulting the umpire on two occasions and $7,500 for throwing coins under the umpire's chair.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev serving at the 2017 Queen's Club Championships\n### 2018 First ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the 2018 season by qualifying for the Sydney International. He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final. This triumph brought him to a new career high ranking of No. 22 and made him the No. 1 player in Russia. The victory also marked the third consecutive final that Medvedev had beaten the home favorite in to win the title. Medvedev reached the Kremlin Cup semifinal, losing to his countryman and eventual champion Karen Khachanov. One week later, he made the semifinals at the ATP 500 Swiss Indoors event, which he lost to Roger Federer. After the tournament, he achieved a new career high ranking of world No. 16.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev finished 2018 with the most hard court match wins of any player on the ATP Tour (38 wins). He also had the most titles on hard court tournaments (3 titles), tying with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Karen Khachanov.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Two Masters titles, US Open final[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the season strongly by reaching the final of the Brisbane International, defeating Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route, but then lost to Kei Nishikori.[34] At the Australian Open, he was seeded 15th, the first time he was seeded at a major. He reached the round of 16 for the first time in his career, where he was defeated by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.[35] In February, Medvedev won his fourth ATP title at the Sofia Open, beating Márton Fucsovics in the final.[36] The following week, Medvedev lost in the semifinals of Rotterdam to Gaël Monfils. Medvedev entered the Monte Carlo Masters having only won two of his 13 career matches on clay courts. Despite this, he reached his first ever Masters 1000 quarterfinal at the event after defeating world No. 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[37] In the quarterfinals, Medvedev earned his first triumph over a world number 1 ranked player, when he defeated Djokovic in three sets.[38] His run ended in the semifinals against Dušan Lajović.[39] At the Barcelona Open, Medvedev earned his third successive top 10 victory (this time over Kei Nishikori) to reach his first clay-court final.[40] There, he was defeated by world No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[41] Following his victory over Nishikori, Medvedev experienced a five-match losing streak, including an opening-round defeat at the French Open. He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov. In the final, he was defeated by defending champion Rafael Nadal. Medvedev would reach a second consecutive Masters final at Cincinnati after beating defending champion Djokovic for the second time, where he defeated David Goffin in straight sets for his first Masters title.[43]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the US Open as the world No. 5.[44] In his second round match, he fought off cramping to defeat Hugo Dellien in four sets.[45] He then defeated Feliciano López in a contentious match for which he was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $4,000 for flipping off the crowd.[46][47] Medvedev next recovered from a set and a break deficit to beat Dominik Köpfer and reach his first Major quarterfinal.[48] He then beat former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals to reach his first Grand Slam final.[49][50] There, Medvedev was defeated by Rafael Nadal in five sets.[51]\n\n\nMedvedev followed up his success in North America with his maiden title on Russian soil at the St. Petersburg Open, to become the first Russian to win the tournament in 15 years.[52][53] Medvedev then won a second consecutive title at the Shanghai Masters, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.[54] By reaching the final, Medvedev became the 7th man since 2000 to reach at least nine finals in a season.[55][56][57] He ended the season losing his last four matches, including all three round robin matches in his ATP Finals debut.\n\n\n\n### 2020 ATP Finals champion, third Masters title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2020 Australian Open\nMedvedev opened his season at the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup as Russia's top ranked singles player. He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles. This included 3 top ten victories (over Diego Schwartzman, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini) extending his win streak over top 10 opponents to ten wins.[65] Medvedev then reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open after straight sets victories over Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, extending his win streak against top 10 opponents to twelve wins, and his overall win streak to twenty wins. In the final, he was defeated by the defending champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[66]\n\n\nMedvedev won his first title of the season at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final.[67] With the win, Medvedev ascended to world number 2 in the ATP rankings, becoming the first man outside of the Big Four to occupy a position in the top 2 since Lleyton Hewitt in July 2005.[68] On 13 April, Medvedev tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters.[69] At the French Open, Medvedev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the grass-court season, Medvedev took a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Championships, where he won his first career grass-court title. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev was upset in the fourth round by Grigor Dimitrov.[81] At the Paris Masters, Medvedev reached the final for the second consecutive year, but lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[82] In his third ATP Finals, Medvedev qualified for the semifinals after winning all of his group matches. He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev represented Russia in the third edition of the ATP Cup. Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. In the final, he was defeated in five epic sets by Rafael Nadal despite taking a two-set lead. At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios. At the Cincinnati Masters, Medvedev was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semifinals. Medvedev was yet again defeated by Kyrgios at the US Open, resulting in Medvedev losing his number one ranking.[105]\n\n\nMedvedev began the fall indoor-hardcourt season by competing at the Moselle Open, where he lost his opening match to Stan Wawrinka in three sets. Medvedev next competed at the Astana Open where he reached the semifinals. In his semifinal match, against Novak Djokovic, Medvedev was forced to retire with the match level at one-set-all with a leg injury.[106][107] Medvedev returned to play at the Vienna Open where he defeated Denis Shapovalov in the final to win his second title of the year, and second ATP 500 title of his career.[108] Medvedev finished the year on a 4 match losing skid, losing in the opening round in Paris Masters, and losing all three of his round robin matches in the ATP Finals in third-set tiebreakers. This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round. As a result, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 to World No. 12.\n\n\nIn February, Medvedev entered the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam seeded 6th, where he made it to the finals whilst dropping only one set. In the final, he defeated Italian No. 1 Jannik Sinner in three sets,[110] thus returning back to the Top 10. The following week, Medvedev entered the Qatar ExxonMobil Open seeded third and won the tournament, defeating Andy Murray in straight sets in the final.\n\n\nIn March, Medvedev defeated No. 2 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets in an all-Russian final to win in Dubai his third title in three weeks,[111] and his 18th title overall thus winning titles in 18 different cities and becoming the first man in the Open Era to accomplish the feat.[112] In this tournament, he did not drop a set including his win against No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic, snapping his 20-match winning streak.[113] As a result he moved back to world No. 6 on 6 March 2023.\n\n\nAt the next Masters 1000 Indian Wells Masters he reached back-to-back quarterfinals defeating 12th seed Alexander Zverev. His victories against 23rd seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and 14h seed Frances Tiafoe propelled him into the final.[114] In the final, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets but reentered the Top 5.[115] In Miami he reached back-to-back finals defeating 14th seed Karen Khachanov and won his 19th title in a 19th different city defeating tenth seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets. He moved to world No. 4 in the rankings on 3 April 2023.[116]\n\n\nMedvedev began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he reached his sixth consecutive quarterfinal with wins over Lorenzo Sonego and 13th seed Alexander Zverev but he lost to sixth seed Holger Rune in the quarterfinals, ending his streak of five consecutive finals.\nAt the next Masters in Madrid he recorded his 300th win over first-time qualifier and compatriot Alexander Shevchenko in the third round.[117] He lost to qualifier, another compatriot Aslan Karatsev in the fourth round. In Rome he reached the semifinals at a Masters 1000 clay-court event for just the second time (after Monte-Carlo 2019) defeating qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.[118] Next he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach only his second final on clay. He won his first clay title defeating Holger Rune, having won 20 titles in 20 different cities. As a result he returned to world No. 2 in the singles rankings on 22 May 2023.[119] Medvedev entered the French Open as the second seed but lost in his first round match against Thiago Seyboth Wild.\n\n\nAt the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, he was seeded 3rd and reached the semifinals for the first time at this Major. Following wins over wildcard Arthur Fery, Adrian Mannarino, Márton Fucsovics, Jiří Lehečka, and Christopher Eubanks in a tight five set match, he set up a semifinal clash with Carlos Alcaraz but lost in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the US Summer Hard Court Swing, Medvedev made the quarterfinals at the Rogers Cup and reached the fourth round at the Cincinnati Masters, losing to Alex De Minaur and Alexander Zverev respectively.[120] Next, at the 2023 US Open, he reached the final following wins over Attila Balazs, Christopher O'Connell, Sebastian Baez, Alex De Minaur, fellow countryman Andrey Rublev, and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals to set up a rematch of the 2021 final with Novak Djokovic. Djokovic won in straight sets on Sunday, September 10. Due to his US Open run, he was the third player to qualify for the 2023 ATP Finals on September 5.[121]\n\n\nAt the Asian Swing, Medvedev reached the final of the China Open where he lost Jannik Sinner straight sets. [122] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he recorded his 60th win of the season to reach the third round over Cristian Garin, after Carlos Alcaraz did the same.[123]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nDaniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches. He also has been employed as an ambassador by BMW, Tinkoff Bank, and HyperX for gaming accessories, mostly for the Russian-speaking world. He was previously endorsed by Lotto for apparel and shoes until 2019.[134][135] Since November 2021, he has been signed as a promoter of the Guojiao 1573 brand.[136]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daniil Medvedev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 1R | 2R | 4R | 4R | F | F | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 21–7\n | 75%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | 1R | 1R | 1R | 1R | QF | 4R | 1R |  | 0 / 7\n | 7–7\n | 50%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q3 | 2R | 3R | 3R | NH\n | 4R | A[a] | SF |  | 0 / 5\n | 13–5\n | 72%\n |\n| US Open | Q1 | 1R | 3R | F | SF | **W** | 4R | F |  | 1 / 7\n | 29–6\n | 83%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–4\n | 5–4\n | 11–4\n | 8–3\n | 20–3\n | 12–3\n | 13–4\n |  | 1 / 26\n | 70–25\n | 74%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Finals: 5 (1 title, 4 runners-ups)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2019 | US Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 5–7, 3–6, 7–5, 6–4, 4–6\n |\n| Loss | 2021 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 5–7, 2–6, 2–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| Loss | 2022 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 6–2, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 4–6, 5–7 |\n| Loss | 2023 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 6–7(5–7), 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2020 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 4–6, 7–6(7–2), 6–4\n |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 4–6, 4–6\n |\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n* These records were attained in the Open Era.\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | 4 consecutive finals of the North American swing/US Open Series | Ivan LendlAndre Agassi[42] |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 in one tournament | Boris BeckerNovak DjokovicDavid Nalbandian |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 to win the ATP Finals | **Stands alone**[138] |\n| 2021\n | Winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season | Andrey RublevFélix Auger-Aliassime |\n| 2021\n | Undefeated winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 2021\n | Tallest Grand Slam champion (6'6\" – 2021 US Open) | Juan Martín del PotroMarin Čilić[139] |\n| 2022\n | Tallest World number 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 2023\n | Winner of his first 20 tour-level titles in 20 different cities | **Stands alone**[140] |\n| 2023\n | Winner of both the Miami Open and Italian Open in the same season\n | Andre AgassiNovak Djokovic |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Medvedev's parents, Sergey and Olga in 2019, receive the Russian Cup[141] |\n\n\nNational\n* The Russian Cup in the nominations:\n\t+ Male Tennis Player of the Year: 2019, 2021;\n\t+ Team of the Year: 2019, 2021.[141]\n* ![](image) Sports title \"Merited Master of Sports of Russia\" (2019)[142]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Russian athletes were banned from competing following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[137][94]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev\". *ATP World Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 by the ATP, achieved on 2 October 2023, making him the highest ranked Italian male player in history (tied with Adriano Panatta). He also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved on 27 September 2021. Sinner has won ten ATP Tour titles in singles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open, and one in doubles.\n\n\nSinner grew up in northern Italy in the region of South Tyrol. He was active in skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. He won the ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2019 after breaking through into the top 100, reaching his first ATP semifinal, and winning the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan.\n\n\nSinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal (becoming the youngest quarterfinalist in men's singles since Novak Djokovic in 2006), and a maiden ATP title at the 2020 Sofia Open. He had a strong start to 2021, highlighted by his second ATP title in a row and a Masters 1000 runner-up at the Miami Open. On 1 November 2021, he became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the ATP top 10. He became the first teenage ATP 500 champion since the category was renamed in 2009 by winning the 2021 Citi Open. Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nJannik Sinner was born 16 August 2001 to Hanspeter and Siglinde Sinner in Innichen in the region of South Tyrol in northern Italy into a Roman Catholic family. He grew up in the town of Sexten, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge.[2] He has a brother named Marc.[3] Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.[4][5][6]\n\n\nWhile training in skiing, Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport.[7] When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach.[8] Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.[9][10]\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nSinner began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour which is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in 2016. Despite having limited success as a junior, he moved mainly to the professional tour following the end of 2017. He never played the main draw of any high-level Grade 1 events in singles, and the only higher-level Grade A tournament he entered was the Trofeo Bonfiglio. He followed up an opening round loss at Italy's Grade A tournament in 2017 with a quarterfinal in 2018. That was the only junior event he played in 2018. He never played any of the junior Grand Slam tournaments. Because he entered so few high-level tournaments, Sinner's career-high junior ranking was a relatively low No. 133.[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2018: ITF Futures and Challenger Tour[edit]\n\n\nSinner wasn't too focused on the junior circuit,[*clarification needed*] and he began playing on the ITF Men's Circuit in early 2018. With his low ranking, he could initially be directly accepted into only ITF Futures events. Nonetheless, he began receiving wild cards for ATP Challenger Tour events, the second-tier tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in the second half of the year.[13] His only ITF title of the year was in doubles,[14] and he finished the season ranked No. 551.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2019: NextGen Finals title and top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2019 NextGen ATP Finals in Milan\nSinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level. He became the first person born in 2001 to reach a Challenger final, and the youngest Italian to win a Challenger title in history. With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324.[16][17] After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz.[18] The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.[19]\n\n\nDuring the second half of the season, Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour.[20] His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July.[15] The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles.[21] After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open.[22] He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.[20]\n\n\nSinner had a strong finish to the season. As a wild card at the European Open, he became the youngest player in five years to reach an ATP semifinal.[23] Along the way, he knocked off top seed and world No. 13 Gaël Monfils for his first career top 50 victory.[24] This performance helped him break into the top 100 for the first time one week later.[15] At the end of the season, Sinner qualified for the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals as the Italian wild card and the lowest seed.[25] He won in his round robin group with victories over Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer, losing only to Ugo Humbert. After defeating Miomir Kecmanović in the semifinals, Sinner upset top seed and world No. 18 Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win the title.[26] He played one last event in Italy the following week, winning a third Challenger title in Ortisei. Sinner finished the year at world No. 78, becoming the youngest player in the year-end top 80 since Rafael Nadal in 2003.[18] He was also named ATP Newcomer of the Year.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2020: First ATP title and top 40[edit]\n\n\nEarly in the year, Sinner made the second round of the 2020 Australian Open, recording his first Grand Slam main draw match win over home wild card Max Purcell before losing to Márton Fucsovics. As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.[28]\n\n\nFollowing the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[29] He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.[30][31]\n\n\nAfter a semifinal at the Cologne Championship where he lost to Zverev,[32] Sinner closed out the season by winning the Sofia Open for his first ATP title. During the event, he defeated Next Gen rival Alex de Minaur and then Vasek Pospisil in the final.[33] He became the youngest Italian tour-level champion in the Open Era and the youngest player overall to win an ATP title since Kei Nishikori in 2008.[34][35]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked world No. 37.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Four titles, Masters final and top 10 debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2021 French Open\nSinner carried over his success from late 2020 into the start of the 2021 season. He won his second career ATP title at the Great Ocean Road Open,[36] and notably defeated No. 20 Karen Khachanov in the semifinals after saving a match point.[37] He became the youngest to win back-to-back ATP titles since Rafael Nadal in 2005.[36] His ten-match winning streak came to an end in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-set match to world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov.[38]\n\n\nSinner's next big result was at the Miami Open, where he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final. During the tournament, he defeated Khachanov again and later world No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal.[39][40] He finished runner-up to Hubert Hurkacz.[41]\n\n\nThen at the French Open, his campaign was stopped short for the second year running by Rafael Nadal who this time defeated Sinner in straight sets in the fourth round.[42] In his main draw debut at Wimbledon, he lost in the first round to Márton Fucsovics.\n\n\nPartnering Reilly Opelka he won his first doubles title at the 2021 Atlanta Open, defeating Steve Johnson and Jordan Thompson.[43] At the same tournament in singles he fell in the second round to Christopher O'Connell.[44]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Citi Open in Washington, D.C., Sinner went into the tournament as the fifth seed and made it to the finals and beat several young players along the way such as Emil Ruusuvuori, Sebastian Korda, and Jenson Brooksby.[45] He beat Mackenzie McDonald in the final to win his third title and first ATP 500 title. Sinner was the first Italian finalist and champion in Washington's tournament history as well as the youngest ATP 500 and first teen champion since the category was created in 2009.[46] As a result, he entered the top 15 in the ATP rankings on 9 August 2021.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the third round to reach the second week of a Major for the second time in the season. Sinner's tournament ended when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the 4th round in straight sets.\n\n\nSinner successfully defended his title at the Sofia Open as the top seed, defeating again second seed Gaël Monfils in the final.[47]\nSinner made his sixth career final at the 2021 European Open without dropping a set en route. He defeated Lorenzo Musetti, Arthur Rinderknech and Lloyd Harris to reach the final.[48] He bested Diego Schwartzman in the final to take his fifth career title. He became the youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Novak Djokovic.[49]\n\n\nOn 1 November, Sinner became the first male player born in the 2000s to break into the top-10 after a semifinal appearance at the Vienna Open.\nAt the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.[50]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev.[51] He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011.[52][53] Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets. As a result, he re-entered the top-10 in the rankings and finished the year at world No. 10 on 22 November 2021.\n\n\nIn the Davis Cup Finals, Sinner defeated John Isner becoming only the second player (after Thiemo de Bakker) ever to bagel Isner.[54]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Three Major quarterfinals, Davis Cup success[edit]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Sinner reached the quarterfinals of a major for the second time in his career, becoming the fifth Italian man to reach that stage in Melbourne.[55] He then lost to fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the Miami Open, he saved three match points in the opening round against Emil Ruusuvuori and five match points against Pablo Carreño Busta to advance to the round of 16.[56] He then defeated Nick Kyrgios but retired against Francisco Cerúndolo in the quarterfinals. In the Monte Carlo Masters, he again reached the quarterfinals after defeating fifth seed Andrey Rublev, before losing to second seed Alexander Zverev in a three-set and over three hour-long match.[57][58] He again saved three match points in the opener at the Madrid Open against Tommy Paul to move to the second round.[59] Next, he defeated Alex de Minaur for his 100th career win;[60] he hit this milestone after 147 matches (100–47) on Tour, which was a faster rate than everyone in the Top 10 besides Rafael Nadal (100–37) and Novak Djokovic (100–43).[61] He was defeated in the third round by Félix Auger-Aliassime.[62]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he retired in the fourth round against Andrey Rublev after sustaining a knee injury.[63]\n\n\nAt the Eastbourne International, Sinner suffered his first opening round loss of the year after losing to Tommy Paul in three sets.[64] At the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, he recorded his first win at this Major over Stan Wawrinka.[65] He then beat Mikael Ymer, John Isner, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his third career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He lost to top seed and eventual champion Novak Djokovic in five sets in the quarterfinals, after being two sets to love up.[66]\n\n\nAt the Croatia Open, Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his first clay court title.[67] In Montreal, he lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the third round.[68] Sinner's loss guaranteed a maiden Masters 1000 finalist from his half of the draw. At the Cincinnati Masters, he lost in the third round to Félix Auger-Aliassime after being up a set, a break, and 2 match points.[69]\n\n\nSeeded 11th at the US Open, he reached the fourth round after defeating Brandon Nakashima in four sets.[70] Next, he defeated Ilya Ivashka in a five set match lasting close to four hours to reach the quarterfinals for the first time at this Major.[71] He became the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments since Novak Djokovic in 2007–08.[72] He lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes; the match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50 am EST) and second longest match in US Open history. Sinner held a match point while serving up 5–4 in the 4th set, but ended up losing the set 5–7.[73][74]\n\n\nIn September, during the Davis Cup Finals after Matteo Berrettini won his singles match against Argentina, Sinner won the second match (best of three matches) and thus secured a place for Italy's Davis Cup team at the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals.[75] Following close to a month break due to an injury sustained in the semifinal at the 2022 Sofia Open[76] he returned to the 2022 Erste Bank Open in Vienna and reached also the quarterfinals losing to top seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.[77] In his next tournament, the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters, he lost in the first round to qualifier Marc-Andrea Huesler.[78]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked 15th in the world, one space ahead of countryman Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Major semifinal, first Masters & world No. 1 wins, World No. 4, ATP Finals debut[edit]\n\n\nSinner's season started at the 2023 Adelaide international 1, where he reached the quarter-final, defeating Kyle Edmund and Thanasi Kokkinakis, before coming up short to eventual finalist Sebastian Korda, being straight-setted 7–5 6–1.\nHis season continued at the 2023 Australian Open, where he made the 4th round, beating Kyle Edmund for the second time, Tomás Martín Etcheverry and Márton Fucsovics before losing to eventual finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in 5 sets.\n\n\nSinner won the 2023 Open Sud de France in Montpellier, his seventh title, becoming the first player to win a tour-level title in the season without having dropped a single set and the first since countryman Lorenzo Musetti won the title in Naples in October 2022.[79]\nAt the 2023 ABN AMRO Open he defeated top seed and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas taking his revenge for the 2023 Australian Open fourth round five setter loss, for his biggest win ever.[80] Next in the quarterfinals, he defeated Stan Wawrinka.[81] In the semifinals, he defeated home favorite Tallon Griekspoor to reach the final.[82] He lost to sixth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\n\nIn March, he played in Indian Wells where he made the semifinals.[83] He defeated Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, and Stan Wawrinka all in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals where he faced defending champion Taylor Fritz and won in a three-set match. In the following round in the semifinals, he lost in straight sets to rival top seed Carlos Alcaraz who returned to world No. 1 following the tournament. \nIn Miami, he reached the quarterfinals of this tournament for a third straight year defeating 21st seed Grigor Dimitrov and sixth seed Andrey Rublev.[84] As a result, he returned to the top 10 in the rankings at world No. 9. He defeated Emil Ruusuvuori to reach back-to-back semifinals.[85] This time he defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to reach his second Miami and career Masters final in three years,[86] putting an end to Alcaraz's hopes for a Sunshine Double and preventing him from returning to the No. 1 spot.[87] He lost to fourth seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets in the final, extending his losing streak versus the Russian to 0–6.[88]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he reached a third consecutive Masters semifinal defeating compatriot and 16th seed Lorenzo Musetti.[89]\nAt the French Open, Sinner, as the No. 8 seed in the draw, was upset as the heavy favourite in the second round by Daniel Altmaier in a five-set match. Sinner served for the match in the fourth set and had match point, but was denied on a net cord shot by Altmaier, who proceeded to break back and eventually win the set and the match.[*citation needed*] The five sets match included three tiebreaks, of which Sinner only won one, in the first set. The match lasted five hours and 26 minutes, the longest match since Lorenzo Giustino against Corentin Moutet six hours and 5 minutes win in 2020, the fifth longest overall of the tournament[90] and the second longest of the season after Kokkinakis against Murray at the Australian Open.[91][92]\n\n\nHe reached back to back quarterfinals at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Diego Schwartzman, Quentin Halys and Daniel Elahi Galan.[93] He reached his first Major semifinal defeating Roman Safiullin, before losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[94]\n\n\nIn August, he won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto defeating Alex de Minaur in straight sets for his eighth ATP title.[95] En route to the final, he defeated compatriot Matteo Berrettini, Andy Murray by walkover, Gaël Monfils, and Tommy Paul.\n\n\nAt the 2023 China Open, he defeated top seed and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, his fourth tour-level win against the Spaniard, to reach his fifth final of the season, defeating second seed and world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev for the first time at the seventh time of asking.[96] As a result, he reached World No. 4 to become the second Italian in the history of the ATP rankings to reach the Top 5, equaling Adriano Panatta.[97] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he lost in the round of 16 to 19th seed Ben Shelton.[98]\n\n\nHe recorded his 55th win over Andrey Rublev to reach his fourth ATP 500 career final in Vienna and became the first Italian man with the most wins for a season in the Open Era surpassing Corrado Barazzutti's 54 mark in 1978.[99] He won the final defeating again top seed Daniil Medvedev to win his tenth ATP title and third at the ATP 500 level, defeating him in two consecutive finals and improving his head-to-head record against the Russian to 2–6. He also recorded his 40 tour-level hard court win in a season for the first time.[100]\n\n\nOn his debut at the 2023 ATP Finals he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the round robin stage, his fifth top-5 win in a row.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nSinner is an aggressive baseliner and is one of the hardest hitters on the ATP tour. Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 kilometres per hour (69.1 mph).[103] His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 100 mph on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.\n\n\nHe also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 kilometres per hour (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%, and it can frequently dip below 55%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint(legs together) and platform(legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.\n\n\nSinner has been compared to Roger Federer for his calm on-court demeanour and all-court movement.[4][7][11] Federer himself has praised Sinner for the balance in his game, remarking, \"What I like about him is that he almost has the same speed of shooting from the forehand and backhand\".[6] Former world No. 1 junior and tennis coach Claudio Pistolesi has praised Sinner's good lateral movement, which he attributes in part to Sinner's background in skiing.[104] In this regard, Sinner has been compared to Novak Djokovic, who also credits a background in skiing for improving his tennis skills.[105]\n\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\nWhen Sinner began to prioritise tennis at age thirteen, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who had also been a part-time coach of Novak Djokovic and Milos Raonic.[11] At the time, he also began working with Andrea Volpini and Massimo Sartori, the latter of whom was a longtime coach of Andreas Seppi.[106] He continued to work with Piatti as his primary coach, and Volpini as his second coach. His team also consisted of physiotherapist Claudio Zimaglia and fitness coach Dalibor Sirola.[10] In February 2022, he decided to stop his long collaboration with Piatti and his team and began to train with Simone Vagnozzi, ex-coach of Marco Cecchinato.[107] In July 2022, coach Darren Cahill officially joined Sinner's team.[108]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco.[3] He is a fan of A.C. Milan football club.[9] One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from Alto Adige. Nonetheless, he has already surpassed Seppi in terms of achievements, with his main idols being Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.[17]\n\n\nSinner speaks three languages: German (mother tongue), Italian and English.[109]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nSinner endorses Nike,[110] Head,[111] Rolex,[112] Gucci,[113] Lavazza,[114] Alfa Romeo,[115] FASTWEB,[116] Technogym,[117] and Parmigiano Reggiano.[118]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jannik Sinner career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 1R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 4\n | 8–4\n | 67%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | QF | 4R | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 4\n | 11–4\n | 73%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q1 | NH\n | 1R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 9–3\n | 75%\n |\n| US Open | 1R | 1R | 4R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 5\n | 10–5\n | 67%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 5–3\n | 6–4\n | 15–4\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 16\n | 38–16\n | 70%\n |\n\n\nSource: ATP profile[3]\n\n\n\n### Year-end championships finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Masters 1000 finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | Miami Open | Hard\n | ![Poland](image) Hubert Hurkacz | 6–7(4–7), 4–6\n |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | Miami Open\n | Hard\n | ![](image) Daniil Medvedev | 5–7, 3–6\n |\n| Win\n | 2023 | Canadian Open | Hard\n | ![Australia](image) Alex de Minaur | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Jannik Sinner career statistics\n* Italian players best ranking\n* Tennis in Italy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Italian pronunciation: [ˈjannik ˈsinner]; German pronunciation: [ˈjanɪk ˈzɪnɐ]\n\n1. **^** \"Jannik Sinner | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 by the ATP, achieved on 2 October 2023, making him the highest ranked Italian male player in history (tied with Adriano Panatta). He also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved on 27 September 2021. Sinner has won ten ATP Tour titles in singles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open, and one in doubles.\n\n\nSinner grew up in northern Italy in the region of South Tyrol. He was active in skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. He won the ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2019 after breaking through into the top 100, reaching his first ATP semifinal, and winning the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan.\n\n\nSinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal (becoming the youngest quarterfinalist in men's singles since Novak Djokovic in 2006), and a maiden ATP title at the 2020 Sofia Open. He had a strong start to 2021, highlighted by his second ATP title in a row and a Masters 1000 runner-up at the Miami Open. On 1 November 2021, he became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the ATP top 10. He became the first teenage ATP 500 champion since the category was renamed in 2009 by winning the 2021 Citi Open. Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nJannik Sinner was born 16 August 2001 to Hanspeter and Siglinde Sinner in Innichen in the region of South Tyrol in northern Italy into a Roman Catholic family. He grew up in the town of Sexten, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge.[2] He has a brother named Marc.[3] Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.[4][5][6]\n\n\nWhile training in skiing, Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport.[7] When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach.[8] Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.[9][10]\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nSinner began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour which is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in 2016. Despite having limited success as a junior, he moved mainly to the professional tour following the end of 2017. He never played the main draw of any high-level Grade 1 events in singles, and the only higher-level Grade A tournament he entered was the Trofeo Bonfiglio. He followed up an opening round loss at Italy's Grade A tournament in 2017 with a quarterfinal in 2018. That was the only junior event he played in 2018. He never played any of the junior Grand Slam tournaments. Because he entered so few high-level tournaments, Sinner's career-high junior ranking was a relatively low No. 133.[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2018: ITF Futures and Challenger Tour[edit]\n\n\nSinner wasn't too focused on the junior circuit,[*clarification needed*] and he began playing on the ITF Men's Circuit in early 2018. With his low ranking, he could initially be directly accepted into only ITF Futures events. Nonetheless, he began receiving wild cards for ATP Challenger Tour events, the second-tier tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in the second half of the year.[13] His only ITF title of the year was in doubles,[14] and he finished the season ranked No. 551.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2019: NextGen Finals title and top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2019 NextGen ATP Finals in Milan\nSinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level. He became the first person born in 2001 to reach a Challenger final, and the youngest Italian to win a Challenger title in history. With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324.[16][17] After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz.[18] The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.[19]\n\n\nDuring the second half of the season, Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour.[20] His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July.[15] The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles.[21] After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open.[22] He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.[20]\n\n\nSinner had a strong finish to the season. As a wild card at the European Open, he became the youngest player in five years to reach an ATP semifinal.[23] Along the way, he knocked off top seed and world No. 13 Gaël Monfils for his first career top 50 victory.[24] This performance helped him break into the top 100 for the first time one week later.[15] At the end of the season, Sinner qualified for the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals as the Italian wild card and the lowest seed.[25] He won in his round robin group with victories over Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer, losing only to Ugo Humbert. After defeating Miomir Kecmanović in the semifinals, Sinner upset top seed and world No. 18 Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win the title.[26] He played one last event in Italy the following week, winning a third Challenger title in Ortisei. Sinner finished the year at world No. 78, becoming the youngest player in the year-end top 80 since Rafael Nadal in 2003.[18] He was also named ATP Newcomer of the Year.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2020: First ATP title and top 40[edit]\n\n\nEarly in the year, Sinner made the second round of the 2020 Australian Open, recording his first Grand Slam main draw match win over home wild card Max Purcell before losing to Márton Fucsovics. As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.[28]\n\n\nFollowing the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[29] He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.[30][31]\n\n\nAfter a semifinal at the Cologne Championship where he lost to Zverev,[32] Sinner closed out the season by winning the Sofia Open for his first ATP title. During the event, he defeated Next Gen rival Alex de Minaur and then Vasek Pospisil in the final.[33] He became the youngest Italian tour-level champion in the Open Era and the youngest player overall to win an ATP title since Kei Nishikori in 2008.[34][35]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked world No. 37.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Four titles, Masters final and top 10 debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2021 French Open\nSinner carried over his success from late 2020 into the start of the 2021 season. He won his second career ATP title at the Great Ocean Road Open,[36] and notably defeated No. 20 Karen Khachanov in the semifinals after saving a match point.[37] He became the youngest to win back-to-back ATP titles since Rafael Nadal in 2005.[36] His ten-match winning streak came to an end in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-set match to world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov.[38]\n\n\nSinner's next big result was at the Miami Open, where he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final. During the tournament, he defeated Khachanov again and later world No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal.[39][40] He finished runner-up to Hubert Hurkacz.[41]\n\n\nThen at the French Open, his campaign was stopped short for the second year running by Rafael Nadal who this time defeated Sinner in straight sets in the fourth round.[42] In his main draw debut at Wimbledon, he lost in the first round to Márton Fucsovics.\n\n\nPartnering Reilly Opelka he won his first doubles title at the 2021 Atlanta Open, defeating Steve Johnson and Jordan Thompson.[43] At the same tournament in singles he fell in the second round to Christopher O'Connell.[44]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Citi Open in Washington, D.C., Sinner went into the tournament as the fifth seed and made it to the finals and beat several young players along the way such as Emil Ruusuvuori, Sebastian Korda, and Jenson Brooksby.[45] He beat Mackenzie McDonald in the final to win his third title and first ATP 500 title. Sinner was the first Italian finalist and champion in Washington's tournament history as well as the youngest ATP 500 and first teen champion since the category was created in 2009.[46] As a result, he entered the top 15 in the ATP rankings on 9 August 2021.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the third round to reach the second week of a Major for the second time in the season. Sinner's tournament ended when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the 4th round in straight sets.\n\n\nSinner successfully defended his title at the Sofia Open as the top seed, defeating again second seed Gaël Monfils in the final.[47]\nSinner made his sixth career final at the 2021 European Open without dropping a set en route. He defeated Lorenzo Musetti, Arthur Rinderknech and Lloyd Harris to reach the final.[48] He bested Diego Schwartzman in the final to take his fifth career title. He became the youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Novak Djokovic.[49]\n\n\nOn 1 November, Sinner became the first male player born in the 2000s to break into the top-10 after a semifinal appearance at the Vienna Open.\nAt the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.[50]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev.[51] He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011.[52][53] Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets. As a result, he re-entered the top-10 in the rankings and finished the year at world No. 10 on 22 November 2021.\n\n\nIn the Davis Cup Finals, Sinner defeated John Isner becoming only the second player (after Thiemo de Bakker) ever to bagel Isner.[54]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Three Major quarterfinals, Davis Cup success[edit]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Sinner reached the quarterfinals of a major for the second time in his career, becoming the fifth Italian man to reach that stage in Melbourne.[55] He then lost to fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the Miami Open, he saved three match points in the opening round against Emil Ruusuvuori and five match points against Pablo Carreño Busta to advance to the round of 16.[56] He then defeated Nick Kyrgios but retired against Francisco Cerúndolo in the quarterfinals. In the Monte Carlo Masters, he again reached the quarterfinals after defeating fifth seed Andrey Rublev, before losing to second seed Alexander Zverev in a three-set and over three hour-long match.[57][58] He again saved three match points in the opener at the Madrid Open against Tommy Paul to move to the second round.[59] Next, he defeated Alex de Minaur for his 100th career win;[60] he hit this milestone after 147 matches (100–47) on Tour, which was a faster rate than everyone in the Top 10 besides Rafael Nadal (100–37) and Novak Djokovic (100–43).[61] He was defeated in the third round by Félix Auger-Aliassime.[62]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he retired in the fourth round against Andrey Rublev after sustaining a knee injury.[63]\n\n\nAt the Eastbourne International, Sinner suffered his first opening round loss of the year after losing to Tommy Paul in three sets.[64] At the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, he recorded his first win at this Major over Stan Wawrinka.[65] He then beat Mikael Ymer, John Isner, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his third career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He lost to top seed and eventual champion Novak Djokovic in five sets in the quarterfinals, after being two sets to love up.[66]\n\n\nAt the Croatia Open, Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his first clay court title.[67] In Montreal, he lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the third round.[68] Sinner's loss guaranteed a maiden Masters 1000 finalist from his half of the draw. At the Cincinnati Masters, he lost in the third round to Félix Auger-Aliassime after being up a set, a break, and 2 match points.[69]\n\n\nSeeded 11th at the US Open, he reached the fourth round after defeating Brandon Nakashima in four sets.[70] Next, he defeated Ilya Ivashka in a five set match lasting close to four hours to reach the quarterfinals for the first time at this Major.[71] He became the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments since Novak Djokovic in 2007–08.[72] He lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes; the match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50 am EST) and second longest match in US Open history. Sinner held a match point while serving up 5–4 in the 4th set, but ended up losing the set 5–7.[73][74]\n\n\nIn September, during the Davis Cup Finals after Matteo Berrettini won his singles match against Argentina, Sinner won the second match (best of three matches) and thus secured a place for Italy's Davis Cup team at the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals.[75] Following close to a month break due to an injury sustained in the semifinal at the 2022 Sofia Open[76] he returned to the 2022 Erste Bank Open in Vienna and reached also the quarterfinals losing to top seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.[77] In his next tournament, the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters, he lost in the first round to qualifier Marc-Andrea Huesler.[78]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked 15th in the world, one space ahead of countryman Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Major semifinal, first Masters & world No. 1 wins, World No. 4, ATP Finals debut[edit]\n\n\nSinner's season started at the 2023 Adelaide international 1, where he reached the quarter-final, defeating Kyle Edmund and Thanasi Kokkinakis, before coming up short to eventual finalist Sebastian Korda, being straight-setted 7–5 6–1.\nHis season continued at the 2023 Australian Open, where he made the 4th round, beating Kyle Edmund for the second time, Tomás Martín Etcheverry and Márton Fucsovics before losing to eventual finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in 5 sets.\n\n\nSinner won the 2023 Open Sud de France in Montpellier, his seventh title, becoming the first player to win a tour-level title in the season without having dropped a single set and the first since countryman Lorenzo Musetti won the title in Naples in October 2022.[79]\nAt the 2023 ABN AMRO Open he defeated top seed and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas taking his revenge for the 2023 Australian Open fourth round five setter loss, for his biggest win ever.[80] Next in the quarterfinals, he defeated Stan Wawrinka.[81] In the semifinals, he defeated home favorite Tallon Griekspoor to reach the final.[82] He lost to sixth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\n\nIn March, he played in Indian Wells where he made the semifinals.[83] He defeated Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, and Stan Wawrinka all in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals where he faced defending champion Taylor Fritz and won in a three-set match. In the following round in the semifinals, he lost in straight sets to rival top seed Carlos Alcaraz who returned to world No. 1 following the tournament. \nIn Miami, he reached the quarterfinals of this tournament for a third straight year defeating 21st seed Grigor Dimitrov and sixth seed Andrey Rublev.[84] As a result, he returned to the top 10 in the rankings at world No. 9. He defeated Emil Ruusuvuori to reach back-to-back semifinals.[85] This time he defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to reach his second Miami and career Masters final in three years,[86] putting an end to Alcaraz's hopes for a Sunshine Double and preventing him from returning to the No. 1 spot.[87] He lost to fourth seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets in the final, extending his losing streak versus the Russian to 0–6.[88]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he reached a third consecutive Masters semifinal defeating compatriot and 16th seed Lorenzo Musetti.[89]\nAt the French Open, Sinner, as the No. 8 seed in the draw, was upset as the heavy favourite in the second round by Daniel Altmaier in a five-set match. Sinner served for the match in the fourth set and had match point, but was denied on a net cord shot by Altmaier, who proceeded to break back and eventually win the set and the match.[*citation needed*] The five sets match included three tiebreaks, of which Sinner only won one, in the first set. The match lasted five hours and 26 minutes, the longest match since Lorenzo Giustino against Corentin Moutet six hours and 5 minutes win in 2020, the fifth longest overall of the tournament[90] and the second longest of the season after Kokkinakis against Murray at the Australian Open.[91][92]\n\n\nHe reached back to back quarterfinals at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Diego Schwartzman, Quentin Halys and Daniel Elahi Galan.[93] He reached his first Major semifinal defeating Roman Safiullin, before losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[94]\n\n\nIn August, he won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto defeating Alex de Minaur in straight sets for his eighth ATP title.[95] En route to the final, he defeated compatriot Matteo Berrettini, Andy Murray by walkover, Gaël Monfils, and Tommy Paul.\n\n\nAt the 2023 China Open, he defeated top seed and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, his fourth tour-level win against the Spaniard, to reach his fifth final of the season, defeating second seed and world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev for the first time at the seventh time of asking.[96] As a result, he reached World No. 4 to become the second Italian in the history of the ATP rankings to reach the Top 5, equaling Adriano Panatta.[97] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he lost in the round of 16 to 19th seed Ben Shelton.[98]\n\n\nHe recorded his 55th win over Andrey Rublev to reach his fourth ATP 500 career final in Vienna and became the first Italian man with the most wins for a season in the Open Era surpassing Corrado Barazzutti's 54 mark in 1978.[99] He won the final defeating again top seed Daniil Medvedev to win his tenth ATP title and third at the ATP 500 level, defeating him in two consecutive finals and improving his head-to-head record against the Russian to 2–6. He also recorded his 40 tour-level hard court win in a season for the first time.[100]\n\n\nOn his debut at the 2023 ATP Finals he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the round robin stage, his fifth top-5 win in a row.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nSinner is an aggressive baseliner and is one of the hardest hitters on the ATP tour. Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 kilometres per hour (69.1 mph).[103] His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 100 mph on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.\n\n\nHe also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 kilometres per hour (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%, and it can frequently dip below 55%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint(legs together) and platform(legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.\n\n\nSinner has been compared to Roger Federer for his calm on-court demeanour and all-court movement.[4][7][11] Federer himself has praised Sinner for the balance in his game, remarking, \"What I like about him is that he almost has the same speed of shooting from the forehand and backhand\".[6] Former world No. 1 junior and tennis coach Claudio Pistolesi has praised Sinner's good lateral movement, which he attributes in part to Sinner's background in skiing.[104] In this regard, Sinner has been compared to Novak Djokovic, who also credits a background in skiing for improving his tennis skills.[105]\n\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\nWhen Sinner began to prioritise tennis at age thirteen, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who had also been a part-time coach of Novak Djokovic and Milos Raonic.[11] At the time, he also began working with Andrea Volpini and Massimo Sartori, the latter of whom was a longtime coach of Andreas Seppi.[106] He continued to work with Piatti as his primary coach, and Volpini as his second coach. His team also consisted of physiotherapist Claudio Zimaglia and fitness coach Dalibor Sirola.[10] In February 2022, he decided to stop his long collaboration with Piatti and his team and began to train with Simone Vagnozzi, ex-coach of Marco Cecchinato.[107] In July 2022, coach Darren Cahill officially joined Sinner's team.[108]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco.[3] He is a fan of A.C. Milan football club.[9] One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from Alto Adige. Nonetheless, he has already surpassed Seppi in terms of achievements, with his main idols being Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.[17]\n\n\nSinner speaks three languages: German (mother tongue), Italian and English.[109]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nSinner endorses Nike,[110] Head,[111] Rolex,[112] Gucci,[113] Lavazza,[114] Alfa Romeo,[115] FASTWEB,[116] Technogym,[117] and Parmigiano Reggiano.[118]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jannik Sinner career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 1R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 4\n | 8–4\n | 67%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | QF | 4R | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 4\n | 11–4\n | 73%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q1 | NH\n | 1R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 9–3\n | 75%\n |\n| US Open | 1R | 1R | 4R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 5\n | 10–5\n | 67%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 5–3\n | 6–4\n | 15–4\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 16\n | 38–16\n | 70%\n |\n\n\nSource: ATP profile[3]\n\n\n\n### Year-end championships finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Masters 1000 finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | Miami Open | Hard\n | ![Poland](image) Hubert Hurkacz | 6–7(4–7), 4–6\n |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | Miami Open\n | Hard\n | ![](image) Daniil Medvedev | 5–7, 3–6\n |\n| Win\n | 2023 | Canadian Open | Hard\n | ![Australia](image) Alex de Minaur | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Jannik Sinner career statistics\n* Italian players best ranking\n* Tennis in Italy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Italian pronunciation: [ˈjannik ˈsinner]; German pronunciation: [ˈjanɪk ˈzɪnɐ]\n\n1. **^** \"Jannik Sinner | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 5 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which he first achieved in September 2021. Rublev has won 14 ATP Tour singles titles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters. He has a career-high doubles ranking of No. 44, achieved on 6 November 2023. He has won four doubles titles, including an Olympic gold medal in the mixed doubles at the 2020 Summer Olympics with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Madrid Open with Karen Khachanov.\n\n\nIn his junior career, Rublev won the 2014 French Open singles title, defeating Jaume Munar in the final.[4] He won the bronze medal in singles and the silver in doubles at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing. Rublev broke into the top 10 of the ATP Tour in October 2020. He has reached the quarterfinals of all four majors, but is the male player of the Open Era to have done so the most times without progressing to the semifinals (holding an 0–9 record in major quarterfinals).[5] He was part of the successful Russian Davis Cup team in 2021. He won his first doubles title at the 2015 Kremlin Cup with Dmitry Tursunov, and among his singles titles are home victories in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAndrey Rublev (Андрей Андреевич Рублёв) was born in Moscow to Andrey Rublev Sr., a former professional boxer turned restaurant manager,[6] and Marina Marenko (née Tyurakova; Тюракова), a tennis coach at the Spartak Tennis Club.[7] His mother worked with tennis players such as Anna Kournikova and received the Medal of the Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\" in 2009. She is also the mother of Anna Arina Marenko, Rublev's older half-sister and former professional tennis player.[8]\n\n\nRublev has Austrian ancestry on his paternal side, through his grandmother Larisa Genrikhovna Rubleva.[9] He often credits his paternal grandparents for raising him as a child for five days a week until he was 15.[10] Rublev denies the claims his mother used to be harsh towards him: \"She was definitely not harsh. My parents always did everything for me. They love me very much\".[11][12] His maternal grandfather, Andrey Fyodorovich Tyurakov was a pro-coach in Greco-Roman wrestling, an amateur tennis player and doubles partner of Boris Sobkin, a coach of professional tennis player Mikhail Youzhny and sparring partner of Grand Slam doubles champion Olga Morozova in her prime years.[13][14]\n\n\nIn 2013, however, Belarusian Sergey Tarasevich became his other coach. Then Tarasevich was replaced by Fernando Vicente from Spain.[15]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev playing at the 2013 junior US Open\nRublev debuted in Luxembourg at age 13, getting his first win in his second competition in Phoenix.[16] In the following years, Rublev could climb the third rounds in singles and in December 2012 he won one of the top junior competitions, the Orange Bowl.[16]\n\n\nNext, in spring of 2013, Rublev achieved the NWU Pukke/RVTA Junior ITF 1 cup in Potchefstroom, South Africa. He successfully competed in following tournaments, especially on clay surface, including the Trofeo Bonfiglio in Milan, and became quarter-finalist at the 2014 Australian Open junior singles. At the doubles competition he paired with German Alexander Zverev, reaching the quarter-finals. The first notable win was at the 2014 French Open junior singles, crushing Jaume Munar.[16] There he also reached the semifinals with partner Stefan Kozlov, before being knocked down by Frenchmen and future winners Benjamin Bonzi / Quentin Halys.[17] He became ITF Junior player World No. 1 on 9 June 2014 after winning the 2014 Junior French Open.[18]\n\n\nShortly before Wimbledon, Rublev captured the cup at the Nike Junior International Roehampton in Roehampton, Great Britain. In the Wimbledon Championships, Rublev reached the third round before being beaten by 1842nd-ranked Dutch van Rijthoven in three tight sets.[19] In doubles, Rublev and Kozlov lost to Brazilians Orlando Luz and Marcelo Zormann in three sets, attaining his first junior Grand Slam final in doubles.[20]\n\n\nRublev took a break before competing at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, where he played in all three events as first-seeded. In singles, he lost to Kamil Majchrzak in three sets, but received a bronze medal for beating Jumpei Yamasaki. Partnering with fellow Karen Khachanov in doubles, Rublev reached the finals, where they again lost to Brazilians Luz and Zormann. He and his mixed partner Daria Kasatkina only reached the second round, where they were defeated by silver medalists Ye Qiuyu and Yamazaki.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Rublev finished his junior career by winning the inaugural ITF Junior Masters in Chengdu, China. In the final, the Russian beat Taylor Fritz in three sets.[21]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2014: Early career and Davis Cup debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2014 Kremlin Cup\nRublev debuted at the Bulgaria F6 Futures, reaching the quarterfinals. He continued his career in Bulgaria, where he again reached the quarterfinals, but became runner-up in doubles. The 15-year-old reached his first ITF Futures final in 2013 in Minsk, Belarus. After an unsuccessful fall, he recorded his first win at the USA F31 Futures in Bradenton, Florida.\n\n\nIn the 2014 Tour he started in Kazakhstan, reaching a semifinal and a final in the two Futures events in Aktobe, respectively. In the latter he beat Belarusian Yaraslav Shyla for his second win. Rublev reached the final of the Czech F1 Futures in doubles, partnering with Pole Andriej Kapaś, and continued his success in the Russian F3 Futures in Moscow, becoming champion in singles and runner-up in the doubles competition.[17]\n\n\n\n### 2015: ATP debut, First doubles title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2015 Wimbledon qualifying round\nIn 2015, Rublev entered his first ATP tournament in Delray Beach, where he reached the second round losing to Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRublev made his debut at the Davis Cup, where in the second round play-off of the Europe Zone Group I, in the third rubber, he partnered with Konstantin Kravchuk and won the match against the Portuguese team Gastão Elias / João Sousa in three sets.[22]\n\n\nThe Russian participated at his first Masters 1000 entry in Miami, where he defeated Pablo Carreño Busta, but lost to John Isner. He entered the clay season at the Barcelona Open, where as a qualifier he reached the second round after overcoming Fernando Verdasco.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith his win over Finn Jarkko Nieminen at Geneva Open, 17-year-old Rublev repeated Nadal's success in winning at least once on five ATP tournaments in one season as a teenager who is under 18 years old. (Nadal did that in 2004.)[23][24]\n\n\nRublev was called for the Davis Cup team in the 2015 Davis Cup Europea/Africa Zone Group I match against Spain, held in Vladivostok. After losing his first match against Tommy Robredo, Rublev won his second match against Pablo Andújar in the decisive fifth rubber to complete a 0–2 comeback for Russia against five-time champion Spain. This secured team Russia a place in the World Group play-offs. Russia played in the World Group play-offs last time in 2012, losing then to Brazil 0–5.[25]\n\n\nHe made his major debut at 2015 US Open as a qualifier. Rublev won his first ATP title at the 2015 Kremlin Cup in doubles, partnering with comeback Dmitry Tursunov.\n\n\n\n### 2016: Challenger title[edit]\n\n\nRublev started the 2016 year at the Chennai Open, losing to Stan Wawrinka in the second round. He reached only the first and second rounds of ATP 250 and Challenger tournaments. In March, this poor performance led to his decision to part ways with his coach Sergey Tarasevich. Immediately after that, on 6 March 2016 he made a turn by winning his first Challenger in singles, defeating Paul-Henri Mathieu in Quimper, France. As a result, Rublev jumped 47 positions from 208th to 161st ranking position, a new career-high.[26] In April, he joined 4Slam Academy in Barcelona, run by Galo Blanco.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2017: First ATP title & Major quarterfinal, top 50[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships\nRublev started well in the 2017 ATP World Tour, reaching the second round of the Australian Open after qualifying. On the way he beat 60th-ranked Yen-Hsun Lu, but then lost to Andy Murray. Rublev was successful in some Challenger tournaments. He reached the 2017 Open de Rennes Challenger final, losing there to Belarusian Uladzimir Ignatik. Again in Quimper, France, Rublev reached the semifinals, losing to Peter Gojowczyk. Rublev also reached the semifinals in Irving, Texas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Russian had some success on grass-court tournaments. He got into the quarterfinals of the Halle Open, losing there to his compatriot Karen Khachanov in a tight match. In the next tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, Rublev could reach round two, losing there to Albert Ramos Viñolas. Despite losing in the qualification round, Rublev as lucky loser reached his first ATP singles final at the Umag Open, beating in the quarterfinals defending champion Fabio Fognini. In the final, he beat Paolo Lorenzi in straight sets to win his first ATP singles title. It was the seventh time that a lucky loser would win a tournament, the last tennis player doing so at that time was Rajeev Ram in 2009 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.[28] He reached the top 50 at World No. 49 on 24 July 2017.[29]\n\n\nRublev went on to compete at the 2017 US Open as a direct entrant. He grabbed his first win against top-10 player, beating No. 9 Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets and made it through to the quarterfinals, beating David Goffin in the fourth round in straight sets. Rublev lost in straight sets to world No. 1 and eventual champion, Rafael Nadal, in the quarterfinals.[30]\n\n\nHe qualified for the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan and made it into the finals, but lost to Hyeon Chung.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2018: First Masters doubles final[edit]\n\n\nRublev commenced the 2018 season in Doha, where he went to the final, eventually losing in straight sets to Gaël Monfils.\nNext, he reached the round of 32 of the Australian Open, where he was seeded for the first time in a Grand Slam event at No. 30, but lost to third seed Grigor Dimitrov, in four sets.[31]\n\n\nRublev continued his run of good form by reaching back-to-back quarterfinals in Montepellier and Rotterdam, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Grigor Dimitrov, respectively. The Russian then had a first round exit in Acapulco, losing to David Ferrer. He did not compete at the 2018 French Open or 2018 Wimbledon due to a back injury he sustained at the Monte Carlo Masters where he lost in the third round to Dominic Thiem after having had a match point.[32]\n\n\nLater in the season after returning to active play he lost to Frenchman Jérémy Chardy in the first round of the US Open.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Top 10 wins, second ATP title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2019 Paris Masters\nRublev opened 2019 by making the round of sixteen in Doha at a tournament in which he had been the runner-up in the previous year. This loss came at the hand of the fifth seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili who defeated Rublev in straight sets in only 61 minutes.[33] Next, in the 2019 Australian Open, Rublev lost in four sets in the first round to American Mackenzie McDonald.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the Hamburg European Open, Rublev achieved his second win over a top 10 player by defeating the top seed and World No. 4 Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals. He lost to Georgian 4th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili in the final.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn August, Rublev had the biggest win of his career so far at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he defeated World No. 3 Roger Federer in the third round in straight sets, handing Federer his fastest loss in some sixteen years.[34] Rublev then went onto to lose to the tournament's eventual winner Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals.[35]\n\n\nAt the US Open, the unseeded Rublev defeated eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets in the first round. In the second round, Rublev won the first set against Gilles Simon, but Simon retired early in the second set, sending Rublev into the third round. There he defeated Australian Nick Kyrgios in straight sets, catapulting him to the round of 16 at a Grand Slam tournament for the second time.[36] There, he lost in straight sets to Matteo Berrettini.[37]\n\n\nLater in the 2019 campaign, Rublev lost in the second round to Fabio Fognini, in straight sets, at the China Open in Beijing, after having beaten Grigor Dimitrov in the first round.[38]\n\n\nOn his 22nd birthday, Rublev won his second ATP title at the Kremlin Cup, defeating the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, in straight sets in the final.[39]\n\n\n\n### 2020: Five ATP titles, World No. 8[edit]\n\n\nRublev entered the 2020 ATP season by winning back-to-back titles. Not allowed to compete in the newly established ATP Cup, as only a country's top two singles tennis players qualified, Rublev instead entered the Qatar Open, this time winning the trophy as he failed to do so two years ago. Next, Rublev took part in the maiden 2020 Adelaide International. Third-seeded, Rublev overcame Canadian Félix Auger-Aliassime in a three-set marathon match in the semifinal, before reaching the final and soundly defeating qualifier Lloyd Harris. Together with his results at 2019 Davis Cup Finals, this was 12th consecutive win for Rublev. He became the first player to win two ATP tournaments in the first two weeks of the season since 2004, when Dominik Hrbatý won tournaments in Adelaide and Auckland.[40]\n\n\nNext up for Rublev was the first of the year's four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian Open where Rublev extended his early 2020 undefeated winning streak to 11 matches by coming from behind for a four-set third round Victory over the 11th seed David Goffin of Belgium. His unbeaten 2020 run then ended the fourth round where he lost in straight sets to the seventh seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, who advanced to his first Australian Open quarterfinal.[41][42]\n\n\nNext in the Rotterdam Open, the seventh-seeded Rublev advanced into the quarterfinals with a round of 16 victory over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan. However, he then lost in straight sets to Filip Krajinović of Serbia who then advanced to the semifinals.[43]\nThen, in February at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Rublev made it to the quarterfinals where he lost in straight sets to the unseeded Dan Evans of Great Britain.[44]\n\n\nAfter tournaments that should have started but were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the late 2020 season saw a number of replacement exhibition tournaments. Rublev participated at the Adria Tour, taking place in the Balkans. The tournament was split into four groups of four players each. Rublev, playing in the Alexander Zverev group, in Zadar, Croatia, beat Marin Čilić, Danilo Petrović and Zverev to qualify into the final, where would have competed with Novak Djokovic. However, one of the participants, Grigor Dimitrov, was tested positive for the coronavirus, and so the final match was cancelled.[45]\n\n\nLater in the season when competition resumed prior to the US Open, Rublev lost in three sets in a two out of three-set-match to British player Dan Evans in the opening round of the Western & Southern Open, which was played this year at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, home of the US Open, instead of Mason, Ohio, where it is traditionally being held.[46] Seeded 10th at the US Open, Rublev defeated Jérémy Chardy and Grégoire Barrère,[47] Salvatore Caruso,[48] all in straight sets. Rublev's round of 16 match pitted was a rematch against a player he lost to in the same round in 2019, the fifth seed Matteo Berrettini. This time, Rublev won in four sets and advanced to his second US Open quarterfinal.[49] He then lost in his quarterfinal match to Daniil Medvedev in straight sets with two tiebreakers.[50]\n\n\nNext, Rublev achieved his third tour title of the year at the Hamburg European Open, where in the final he defeated second seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets.[51] However, Tsitsipas returned serve by defeating Rublev in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2020 French Open. However, this performance guaranteed him a place in the top ten of the ATP rankings on 12 October 2020.[52] Rublev then won his fourth title of the year at the St. Petersburg Open, defeating seventh seed Borna Ćorić, in straight sets.[53] He reached a career-high of World No. 8 on 19 October 2020.[29]\n\n\nIn late October, Rublev achieved his fifth title of 2020 by winning the Vienna Open as the fifth seed. He defeated qualifier Norbert Gombos in straight sets to win his first match of the tournament. Rublev would then beat Jannik Sinner in three sets with Sinner retiring after only three games due to injury. Rublev would then upset second seed and defending champion Dominic Thiem. Rublev would then eliminate Kevin Anderson, Anderson would retire in the second set due to injury. Rublev won his match with Anderson. Rublev would then defeat lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego to win the 2020 Vienna Open singles title.[54] With this win, Rublev qualified for the ATP Finals in London, which was his first ATP Finals appearance.[55]\n\n\nIn mid-November, at the ATP Finals, Rublev was placed in Group London 2020, where he would be eliminated in the round-robin phase. He started off his ATP-Finals debut with a match against Rafael Nadal – the second seed. Nadal beat Rublev. Two days after his loss, Rublev would face off against defending champion and sixth seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas. In his match, Rublev got match point on serve during the deciding set tiebreaker, but he double faulted, and lost the tiebreak and the match. Tsitsipas won. With his loss, Rublev was eliminated from the tournament.[56] Two days later, Rublev faced his final opponent: third seed Dominic Thiem whom Rublev defeated to conclude his ATP Final debut.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Olympic mixed doubles gold, World No. 5[edit]\n\n\nRublev started his 2021 season with a title at the ATP Cup, a country-based team event. Playing for Russia, in a team with Daniil Medvedev, Aslan Karatsev, and Evgeny Donskoy, Rublev bested Argentina's Guido Pella and Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka in the group stage to help his team advance into the semifinals. There he defeated Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, coming back from a set down to win. In the final of the ATP Cup, Rublev beat Italy's Fabio Fognini in straight sets.[58]\n\n\nRublev advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open after defeating Yannick Hanfmann, Thiago Monteiro, Feliciano López, and Casper Ruud.\n\n\nRublev then won the Rotterdam Open, defeating Márton Fucsovics in the final. He also bested top-ten player Tsitsipas en route to the final. With this title, Rublev reached a twenty match winning streak at ATP Tour 500 tournaments, which is the third longest ATP 500 winning streak in tennis history.[59]\n\n\nThe next week, he went on to win doubles at the Qatar Open partnering Aslan Karatsev but lost his first singles match to Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal. Rublev's previous rounds were won by walkovers due to his opponents' injuries.[60] The week after, at the 2021 Dubai Tennis Championships he extended his winning streak to twenty one matches with his victory over Emil Ruusuvuori in the second round. With this 21st consecutive win at ATP 500 events, Rublev tied Andy Murray for the second-longest winning streak at the tournament level (since 2009) and also second overall, the only other player to own a longer run of ATP 500 victories being Roger Federer (28).[61] Rublev went on to reach the semifinals defeating Taylor Fritz and Márton Fucsovics in the quarterfinals (for the third time in 2021), losing to wildcard and eventual champion Aslan Karatsev in the semifinals.[62][63]\n\n\nIn April, seeded fourth, Rublev reached his first semifinal at a Masters 1000 level at the 2021 Miami Open[64][65] where he was defeated by the eventual champion Hubert Hurkacz.[66]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Rublev reached his first singles Masters 1000 final, defeating 11-time champion Rafael Nadal en route. Although he lost to Tsitsipas in the championship match, he reached a career-high of world No. 7 and overtook Roger Federer in the rankings for the first time in his career.[67][68]\n\n\nAt the 2021 French Open Rublev was upset in the first round in 5 sets by Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany.[69][70]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Wimbledon Championships Rublev reached the fourth round for the first time in his career defeating 26th seed Fabio Fognini.[71] This marked the first time three Russian players reached the fourth round at the All England Club since 2006, when Elena Dementieva, Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova made their run.[72] He was finally defeated by Márton Fucsovics whom he beat in 5 consecutive meetings between the two since his win at the 2020 French Open including Fucsovics's withdrawal in Qatar.[73]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, he won the mixed doubles title with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeating compatriots Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina in the final. Rublev was playing mixed doubles for the first time in his professional career and has no plans to continue until the next Olympics.[74][75]\n\n\nAt the Western & Southern Open, Rublev reached his second Masters 1000 final defeating Marin Čilić, Gaël Monfils, Benoît Paire in the quarterfinals[76] and compatriot and top seed Daniil Medvedev in the semifinal, his maiden win over the World No. 2 and the biggest win of his career.[77] In the final, he lost to Alexander Zverev in straight sets. The match, lasting just 59 minutes, was the shortest final contested in the history of the tournament.[78][79]\n\n\nAt the final Grand Slam event of the year, the 2021 US Open, Rublev was seeded fifth in lieu of the absence of such players as Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem. He lost in five sets in the third round to Frances Tiafoe of the United States.[80] As a result of this run, he made his Top 5 debut on 13 September 2021.[29]\n\n\nAt the 2021 San Diego Open, he reached his eighth semifinal of the year, defeating 6th seed Diego Schwartzman.[81]\n\n\nAt the 2021 BNP Paribas Open, he reached the final in doubles partnering Aslan Karatsev where they were defeated by John Peers/Filip Polášek duo. As a result, he reached a new career-high ranking in doubles of No. 59 on 18 October 2021.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Two Major quarterfinals, four titles, ATP Finals semifinalist[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nRublev reached the third round of the 2022 Australian Open where he was defeated by Marin Čilić.[82]\n\n\nRublev reached his first final of 2022 at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating three French players en route Richard Gasquet, Lucas Pouille and ninth seed Benjamin Bonzi with all matches going to three sets.[83] He defeated world No. 9 Félix Auger-Aliassime for his ninth singles title.\nAt the same tournament he reached the quarterfinals with Ukrainian Denys Molchanov.[84] The duo won against the French pair of Bonzi/Albano Olivetti to reach the semifinals and Hugo Gaston/Holger Rune to reach also the final. He lifted the doubles trophy as well just hours after winning the singles to make it a Marseille double against South African Raven Klaasen and Japanese Ben McLachlan.

Rublev became the 25th active men's player to record 250 career wins, the ninth man born in 1990 or later to achieve the feat, and just the fourth man born in 1995 or later to do it after Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.[99] Following wins over Karen Khachanov, Jan-Lennard Struff, Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune he lifted his first Masters 1000 trophy, the biggest of his career.

His running forehand is particularly lethal because of his consistency and comfort with the shot, making many passing shots with it. Despite his power, Rublev is often hyper-aggressive and can enter situations where he makes consecutive unforced errors, causing technical and mental difficulty to follow. However, he can also demonstrate periods when his forehand is elusive. He states that he does not prefer a particular tennis surface.[16]\n\n\nRublev has a powerful first serve that often reaches 200+ km/h (125+ mph). His second serve, however, is underwhelming because of his high number of double faults during matches, as well as being much slower than his first serve. In 2020, Yevgeny Kafelnikov said the following about Rublev's game: \"I think his whole game, it just has some elements of playing junior tennis, hitting the ball harder and harder. If he improves in those two departments, his footwork and second serve, his whole game is going to change.\"[109]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nRublev has been endorsed by Head for racquets,[110] Italian luxury brand Bulgari for watches, and Penhaligon's for perfume.[111] He used to be endorsed by Wilson for racquets and by Nike for apparel and shoes.[112] In 2023, Rublev launched his own clothing brand Rublo, that is \"not about clothes\". Rublo has been created to drive awareness around equality and kindness with the hope of making our world a better place, as he claims.[113]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nOutside tennis, Rublev practises boxing and basketball, and he is particularly interested in Mike Tyson.[114] Rublev also creates his own electronic music like his idols – Martin Garrix and Alan Walker.[115] Rublev is nicknamed the \"Rubl'\", akin to the Russian word 'ruble'.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 5 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which he first achieved in September 2021. Rublev has won 14 ATP Tour singles titles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Monte-Carlo Masters. He has a career-high doubles ranking of No. 44, achieved on 6 November 2023. He has won four doubles titles, including an Olympic gold medal in the mixed doubles at the 2020 Summer Olympics with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Madrid Open with Karen Khachanov.\n\n\nIn his junior career, Rublev won the 2014 French Open singles title, defeating Jaume Munar in the final.[4] He won the bronze medal in singles and the silver in doubles at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing. Rublev broke into the top 10 of the ATP Tour in October 2020. He has reached the quarterfinals of all four majors, but is the male player of the Open Era to have done so the most times without progressing to the semifinals (holding an 0–9 record in major quarterfinals).[5] He was part of the successful Russian Davis Cup team in 2021. He won his first doubles title at the 2015 Kremlin Cup with Dmitry Tursunov, and among his singles titles are home victories in Moscow and St. Petersburg.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAndrey Rublev (Андрей Андреевич Рублёв) was born in Moscow to Andrey Rublev Sr., a former professional boxer turned restaurant manager,[6] and Marina Marenko (née Tyurakova; Тюракова), a tennis coach at the Spartak Tennis Club.[7] His mother worked with tennis players such as Anna Kournikova and received the Medal of the Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\" in 2009. She is also the mother of Anna Arina Marenko, Rublev's older half-sister and former professional tennis player.[8]\n\n\nRublev has Austrian ancestry on his paternal side, through his grandmother Larisa Genrikhovna Rubleva.[9] He often credits his paternal grandparents for raising him as a child for five days a week until he was 15.[10] Rublev denies the claims his mother used to be harsh towards him: \"She was definitely not harsh. My parents always did everything for me. They love me very much\".[11][12] His maternal grandfather, Andrey Fyodorovich Tyurakov was a pro-coach in Greco-Roman wrestling, an amateur tennis player and doubles partner of Boris Sobkin, a coach of professional tennis player Mikhail Youzhny and sparring partner of Grand Slam doubles champion Olga Morozova in her prime years.[13][14]\n\n\nIn 2013, however, Belarusian Sergey Tarasevich became his other coach. Then Tarasevich was replaced by Fernando Vicente from Spain.[15]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev playing at the 2013 junior US Open\nRublev debuted in Luxembourg at age 13, getting his first win in his second competition in Phoenix.[16] In the following years, Rublev could climb the third rounds in singles and in December 2012 he won one of the top junior competitions, the Orange Bowl.[16]\n\n\nNext, in spring of 2013, Rublev achieved the NWU Pukke/RVTA Junior ITF 1 cup in Potchefstroom, South Africa. He successfully competed in following tournaments, especially on clay surface, including the Trofeo Bonfiglio in Milan, and became quarter-finalist at the 2014 Australian Open junior singles. At the doubles competition he paired with German Alexander Zverev, reaching the quarter-finals. The first notable win was at the 2014 French Open junior singles, crushing Jaume Munar.[16] There he also reached the semifinals with partner Stefan Kozlov, before being knocked down by Frenchmen and future winners Benjamin Bonzi / Quentin Halys.[17] He became ITF Junior player World No. 1 on 9 June 2014 after winning the 2014 Junior French Open.[18]\n\n\nShortly before Wimbledon, Rublev captured the cup at the Nike Junior International Roehampton in Roehampton, Great Britain. In the Wimbledon Championships, Rublev reached the third round before being beaten by 1842nd-ranked Dutch van Rijthoven in three tight sets.[19] In doubles, Rublev and Kozlov lost to Brazilians Orlando Luz and Marcelo Zormann in three sets, attaining his first junior Grand Slam final in doubles.[20]\n\n\nRublev took a break before competing at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics, where he played in all three events as first-seeded. In singles, he lost to Kamil Majchrzak in three sets, but received a bronze medal for beating Jumpei Yamasaki. Partnering with fellow Karen Khachanov in doubles, Rublev reached the finals, where they again lost to Brazilians Luz and Zormann. He and his mixed partner Daria Kasatkina only reached the second round, where they were defeated by silver medalists Ye Qiuyu and Yamazaki.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2015, Rublev finished his junior career by winning the inaugural ITF Junior Masters in Chengdu, China. In the final, the Russian beat Taylor Fritz in three sets.[21]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2014: Early career and Davis Cup debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2014 Kremlin Cup\nRublev debuted at the Bulgaria F6 Futures, reaching the quarterfinals. He continued his career in Bulgaria, where he again reached the quarterfinals, but became runner-up in doubles. The 15-year-old reached his first ITF Futures final in 2013 in Minsk, Belarus. After an unsuccessful fall, he recorded his first win at the USA F31 Futures in Bradenton, Florida.\n\n\nIn the 2014 Tour he started in Kazakhstan, reaching a semifinal and a final in the two Futures events in Aktobe, respectively. In the latter he beat Belarusian Yaraslav Shyla for his second win. Rublev reached the final of the Czech F1 Futures in doubles, partnering with Pole Andriej Kapaś, and continued his success in the Russian F3 Futures in Moscow, becoming champion in singles and runner-up in the doubles competition.[17]\n\n\n\n### 2015: ATP debut, First doubles title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2015 Wimbledon qualifying round\nIn 2015, Rublev entered his first ATP tournament in Delray Beach, where he reached the second round losing to Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRublev made his debut at the Davis Cup, where in the second round play-off of the Europe Zone Group I, in the third rubber, he partnered with Konstantin Kravchuk and won the match against the Portuguese team Gastão Elias / João Sousa in three sets.[22]\n\n\nThe Russian participated at his first Masters 1000 entry in Miami, where he defeated Pablo Carreño Busta, but lost to John Isner. He entered the clay season at the Barcelona Open, where as a qualifier he reached the second round after overcoming Fernando Verdasco.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith his win over Finn Jarkko Nieminen at Geneva Open, 17-year-old Rublev repeated Nadal's success in winning at least once on five ATP tournaments in one season as a teenager who is under 18 years old. (Nadal did that in 2004.)[23][24]\n\n\nRublev was called for the Davis Cup team in the 2015 Davis Cup Europea/Africa Zone Group I match against Spain, held in Vladivostok. After losing his first match against Tommy Robredo, Rublev won his second match against Pablo Andújar in the decisive fifth rubber to complete a 0–2 comeback for Russia against five-time champion Spain. This secured team Russia a place in the World Group play-offs. Russia played in the World Group play-offs last time in 2012, losing then to Brazil 0–5.[25]\n\n\nHe made his major debut at 2015 US Open as a qualifier. Rublev won his first ATP title at the 2015 Kremlin Cup in doubles, partnering with comeback Dmitry Tursunov.\n\n\n\n### 2016: Challenger title[edit]\n\n\nRublev started the 2016 year at the Chennai Open, losing to Stan Wawrinka in the second round. He reached only the first and second rounds of ATP 250 and Challenger tournaments. In March, this poor performance led to his decision to part ways with his coach Sergey Tarasevich. Immediately after that, on 6 March 2016 he made a turn by winning his first Challenger in singles, defeating Paul-Henri Mathieu in Quimper, France. As a result, Rublev jumped 47 positions from 208th to 161st ranking position, a new career-high.[26] In April, he joined 4Slam Academy in Barcelona, run by Galo Blanco.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2017: First ATP title & Major quarterfinal, top 50[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships\nRublev started well in the 2017 ATP World Tour, reaching the second round of the Australian Open after qualifying. On the way he beat 60th-ranked Yen-Hsun Lu, but then lost to Andy Murray. Rublev was successful in some Challenger tournaments. He reached the 2017 Open de Rennes Challenger final, losing there to Belarusian Uladzimir Ignatik. Again in Quimper, France, Rublev reached the semifinals, losing to Peter Gojowczyk. Rublev also reached the semifinals in Irving, Texas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Russian had some success on grass-court tournaments. He got into the quarterfinals of the Halle Open, losing there to his compatriot Karen Khachanov in a tight match. In the next tournament, the Wimbledon Championships, Rublev could reach round two, losing there to Albert Ramos Viñolas. Despite losing in the qualification round, Rublev as lucky loser reached his first ATP singles final at the Umag Open, beating in the quarterfinals defending champion Fabio Fognini. In the final, he beat Paolo Lorenzi in straight sets to win his first ATP singles title. It was the seventh time that a lucky loser would win a tournament, the last tennis player doing so at that time was Rajeev Ram in 2009 Hall of Fame Tennis Championships.[28] He reached the top 50 at World No. 49 on 24 July 2017.[29]\n\n\nRublev went on to compete at the 2017 US Open as a direct entrant. He grabbed his first win against top-10 player, beating No. 9 Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets and made it through to the quarterfinals, beating David Goffin in the fourth round in straight sets. Rublev lost in straight sets to world No. 1 and eventual champion, Rafael Nadal, in the quarterfinals.[30]\n\n\nHe qualified for the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan and made it into the finals, but lost to Hyeon Chung.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2018: First Masters doubles final[edit]\n\n\nRublev commenced the 2018 season in Doha, where he went to the final, eventually losing in straight sets to Gaël Monfils.\nNext, he reached the round of 32 of the Australian Open, where he was seeded for the first time in a Grand Slam event at No. 30, but lost to third seed Grigor Dimitrov, in four sets.[31]\n\n\nRublev continued his run of good form by reaching back-to-back quarterfinals in Montepellier and Rotterdam, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Grigor Dimitrov, respectively. The Russian then had a first round exit in Acapulco, losing to David Ferrer. He did not compete at the 2018 French Open or 2018 Wimbledon due to a back injury he sustained at the Monte Carlo Masters where he lost in the third round to Dominic Thiem after having had a match point.[32]\n\n\nLater in the season after returning to active play he lost to Frenchman Jérémy Chardy in the first round of the US Open.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Top 10 wins, second ATP title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2019 Paris Masters\nRublev opened 2019 by making the round of sixteen in Doha at a tournament in which he had been the runner-up in the previous year. This loss came at the hand of the fifth seeded Nikoloz Basilashvili who defeated Rublev in straight sets in only 61 minutes.[33] Next, in the 2019 Australian Open, Rublev lost in four sets in the first round to American Mackenzie McDonald.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the Hamburg European Open, Rublev achieved his second win over a top 10 player by defeating the top seed and World No. 4 Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals. He lost to Georgian 4th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili in the final.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn August, Rublev had the biggest win of his career so far at the Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he defeated World No. 3 Roger Federer in the third round in straight sets, handing Federer his fastest loss in some sixteen years.[34] Rublev then went onto to lose to the tournament's eventual winner Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals.[35]\n\n\nAt the US Open, the unseeded Rublev defeated eighth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in four sets in the first round. In the second round, Rublev won the first set against Gilles Simon, but Simon retired early in the second set, sending Rublev into the third round. There he defeated Australian Nick Kyrgios in straight sets, catapulting him to the round of 16 at a Grand Slam tournament for the second time.[36] There, he lost in straight sets to Matteo Berrettini.[37]\n\n\nLater in the 2019 campaign, Rublev lost in the second round to Fabio Fognini, in straight sets, at the China Open in Beijing, after having beaten Grigor Dimitrov in the first round.[38]\n\n\nOn his 22nd birthday, Rublev won his second ATP title at the Kremlin Cup, defeating the Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, in straight sets in the final.[39]\n\n\n\n### 2020: Five ATP titles, World No. 8[edit]\n\n\nRublev entered the 2020 ATP season by winning back-to-back titles. Not allowed to compete in the newly established ATP Cup, as only a country's top two singles tennis players qualified, Rublev instead entered the Qatar Open, this time winning the trophy as he failed to do so two years ago. Next, Rublev took part in the maiden 2020 Adelaide International. Third-seeded, Rublev overcame Canadian Félix Auger-Aliassime in a three-set marathon match in the semifinal, before reaching the final and soundly defeating qualifier Lloyd Harris. Together with his results at 2019 Davis Cup Finals, this was 12th consecutive win for Rublev. He became the first player to win two ATP tournaments in the first two weeks of the season since 2004, when Dominik Hrbatý won tournaments in Adelaide and Auckland.[40]\n\n\nNext up for Rublev was the first of the year's four Grand Slam tournaments, the Australian Open where Rublev extended his early 2020 undefeated winning streak to 11 matches by coming from behind for a four-set third round Victory over the 11th seed David Goffin of Belgium. His unbeaten 2020 run then ended the fourth round where he lost in straight sets to the seventh seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, who advanced to his first Australian Open quarterfinal.[41][42]\n\n\nNext in the Rotterdam Open, the seventh-seeded Rublev advanced into the quarterfinals with a round of 16 victory over Alexander Bublik of Kazakhstan. However, he then lost in straight sets to Filip Krajinović of Serbia who then advanced to the semifinals.[43]\nThen, in February at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Rublev made it to the quarterfinals where he lost in straight sets to the unseeded Dan Evans of Great Britain.[44]\n\n\nAfter tournaments that should have started but were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the late 2020 season saw a number of replacement exhibition tournaments. Rublev participated at the Adria Tour, taking place in the Balkans. The tournament was split into four groups of four players each. Rublev, playing in the Alexander Zverev group, in Zadar, Croatia, beat Marin Čilić, Danilo Petrović and Zverev to qualify into the final, where would have competed with Novak Djokovic. However, one of the participants, Grigor Dimitrov, was tested positive for the coronavirus, and so the final match was cancelled.[45]\n\n\nLater in the season when competition resumed prior to the US Open, Rublev lost in three sets in a two out of three-set-match to British player Dan Evans in the opening round of the Western & Southern Open, which was played this year at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, home of the US Open, instead of Mason, Ohio, where it is traditionally being held.[46] Seeded 10th at the US Open, Rublev defeated Jérémy Chardy and Grégoire Barrère,[47] Salvatore Caruso,[48] all in straight sets. Rublev's round of 16 match pitted was a rematch against a player he lost to in the same round in 2019, the fifth seed Matteo Berrettini. This time, Rublev won in four sets and advanced to his second US Open quarterfinal.[49] He then lost in his quarterfinal match to Daniil Medvedev in straight sets with two tiebreakers.[50]\n\n\nNext, Rublev achieved his third tour title of the year at the Hamburg European Open, where in the final he defeated second seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas in three sets.[51] However, Tsitsipas returned serve by defeating Rublev in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2020 French Open. However, this performance guaranteed him a place in the top ten of the ATP rankings on 12 October 2020.[52] Rublev then won his fourth title of the year at the St. Petersburg Open, defeating seventh seed Borna Ćorić, in straight sets.[53] He reached a career-high of World No. 8 on 19 October 2020.[29]\n\n\nIn late October, Rublev achieved his fifth title of 2020 by winning the Vienna Open as the fifth seed. He defeated qualifier Norbert Gombos in straight sets to win his first match of the tournament. Rublev would then beat Jannik Sinner in three sets with Sinner retiring after only three games due to injury. Rublev would then upset second seed and defending champion Dominic Thiem. Rublev would then eliminate Kevin Anderson, Anderson would retire in the second set due to injury. Rublev won his match with Anderson. Rublev would then defeat lucky loser Lorenzo Sonego to win the 2020 Vienna Open singles title.[54] With this win, Rublev qualified for the ATP Finals in London, which was his first ATP Finals appearance.[55]\n\n\nIn mid-November, at the ATP Finals, Rublev was placed in Group London 2020, where he would be eliminated in the round-robin phase. He started off his ATP-Finals debut with a match against Rafael Nadal – the second seed. Nadal beat Rublev. Two days after his loss, Rublev would face off against defending champion and sixth seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas. In his match, Rublev got match point on serve during the deciding set tiebreaker, but he double faulted, and lost the tiebreak and the match. Tsitsipas won. With his loss, Rublev was eliminated from the tournament.[56] Two days later, Rublev faced his final opponent: third seed Dominic Thiem whom Rublev defeated to conclude his ATP Final debut.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Olympic mixed doubles gold, World No. 5[edit]\n\n\nRublev started his 2021 season with a title at the ATP Cup, a country-based team event. Playing for Russia, in a team with Daniil Medvedev, Aslan Karatsev, and Evgeny Donskoy, Rublev bested Argentina's Guido Pella and Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka in the group stage to help his team advance into the semifinals. There he defeated Germany's Jan-Lennard Struff, coming back from a set down to win. In the final of the ATP Cup, Rublev beat Italy's Fabio Fognini in straight sets.[58]\n\n\nRublev advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open after defeating Yannick Hanfmann, Thiago Monteiro, Feliciano López, and Casper Ruud.\n\n\nRublev then won the Rotterdam Open, defeating Márton Fucsovics in the final. He also bested top-ten player Tsitsipas en route to the final. With this title, Rublev reached a twenty match winning streak at ATP Tour 500 tournaments, which is the third longest ATP 500 winning streak in tennis history.[59]\n\n\nThe next week, he went on to win doubles at the Qatar Open partnering Aslan Karatsev but lost his first singles match to Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal. Rublev's previous rounds were won by walkovers due to his opponents' injuries.[60] The week after, at the 2021 Dubai Tennis Championships he extended his winning streak to twenty one matches with his victory over Emil Ruusuvuori in the second round. With this 21st consecutive win at ATP 500 events, Rublev tied Andy Murray for the second-longest winning streak at the tournament level (since 2009) and also second overall, the only other player to own a longer run of ATP 500 victories being Roger Federer (28).[61] Rublev went on to reach the semifinals defeating Taylor Fritz and Márton Fucsovics in the quarterfinals (for the third time in 2021), losing to wildcard and eventual champion Aslan Karatsev in the semifinals.[62][63]\n\n\nIn April, seeded fourth, Rublev reached his first semifinal at a Masters 1000 level at the 2021 Miami Open[64][65] where he was defeated by the eventual champion Hubert Hurkacz.[66]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo, Rublev reached his first singles Masters 1000 final, defeating 11-time champion Rafael Nadal en route. Although he lost to Tsitsipas in the championship match, he reached a career-high of world No. 7 and overtook Roger Federer in the rankings for the first time in his career.[67][68]\n\n\nAt the 2021 French Open Rublev was upset in the first round in 5 sets by Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany.[69][70]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Wimbledon Championships Rublev reached the fourth round for the first time in his career defeating 26th seed Fabio Fognini.[71] This marked the first time three Russian players reached the fourth round at the All England Club since 2006, when Elena Dementieva, Anastasia Myskina and Maria Sharapova made their run.[72] He was finally defeated by Márton Fucsovics whom he beat in 5 consecutive meetings between the two since his win at the 2020 French Open including Fucsovics's withdrawal in Qatar.[73]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, he won the mixed doubles title with Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeating compatriots Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina in the final. Rublev was playing mixed doubles for the first time in his professional career and has no plans to continue until the next Olympics.[74][75]\n\n\nAt the Western & Southern Open, Rublev reached his second Masters 1000 final defeating Marin Čilić, Gaël Monfils, Benoît Paire in the quarterfinals[76] and compatriot and top seed Daniil Medvedev in the semifinal, his maiden win over the World No. 2 and the biggest win of his career.[77] In the final, he lost to Alexander Zverev in straight sets. The match, lasting just 59 minutes, was the shortest final contested in the history of the tournament.[78][79]\n\n\nAt the final Grand Slam event of the year, the 2021 US Open, Rublev was seeded fifth in lieu of the absence of such players as Rafael Nadal and Dominic Thiem. He lost in five sets in the third round to Frances Tiafoe of the United States.[80] As a result of this run, he made his Top 5 debut on 13 September 2021.[29]\n\n\nAt the 2021 San Diego Open, he reached his eighth semifinal of the year, defeating 6th seed Diego Schwartzman.[81]\n\n\nAt the 2021 BNP Paribas Open, he reached the final in doubles partnering Aslan Karatsev where they were defeated by John Peers/Filip Polášek duo. As a result, he reached a new career-high ranking in doubles of No. 59 on 18 October 2021.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Two Major quarterfinals, four titles, ATP Finals semifinalist[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nRublev reached the third round of the 2022 Australian Open where he was defeated by Marin Čilić.[82]\n\n\nRublev reached his first final of 2022 at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating three French players en route Richard Gasquet, Lucas Pouille and ninth seed Benjamin Bonzi with all matches going to three sets.[83] He defeated world No. 9 Félix Auger-Aliassime for his ninth singles title.\nAt the same tournament he reached the quarterfinals with Ukrainian Denys Molchanov.[84] The duo won against the French pair of Bonzi/Albano Olivetti to reach the semifinals and Hugo Gaston/Holger Rune to reach also the final. He lifted the doubles trophy as well just hours after winning the singles to make it a Marseille double against South African Raven Klaasen and Japanese Ben McLachlan. With the victory, he became just the third player to sweep both the singles and doubles titles in the tournament's 30-year history.[85]\n\n\nOn 26 February, Rublev won the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championship in Dubai, UAE defeating the Czech player Jiří Veselý in straight set to gain his tenth ATP singles title.[86] Rublev also made international news headlines when, after winning his semifinal match, he wrote \"No war please\" on a camera lens a few days into the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[87]\n\n\nNext Rublev defeated 33rd seed Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals at the 2022 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells before losing in straight sets in the semifinals to the 20th seed and eventual champion American Taylor Fritz.[88]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Rublev defeated in three sets world No. 1 ranked Novak Djokovic, in the final of 2022 Serbia Open.[89] At Roland Garros, Rublev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost in a fifth set tiebreak to 20th seed Marin Čilić.\n\n\nThe All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Rublev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[90]\n\n\nSeeded ninth at the US Open he reached the fourth round, defeating 19th seed Denis Shapovalov in a five set thriller with a fifth set super tiebreak lasting over four hours, for the fourth time at this Major.[91] Next he defeated 7th seed Cameron Norrie in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals, where he was subsequently defeated by Frances Tiafoe.[92]\n\n\nRublev won his fourth title of the year at the Gijón Open in Spain defeated Sebastian Korda in straight sets.[93]\n\n\nSeeded sixth, the world No. 7 Rublev qualified for his third ATP Finals in a row and reached the semifinals for the first time defeating two former season finale champions world No. 5 Daniil Medvedev and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas to set up a meeting with world No. 4 Casper Ruud.[94][95] In the semifinal, he lost in straight sets to Ruud.[96]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 250th career win, First Masters Title & 3 Grand Slam Quarter-Finals, Shanghai Final[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rublev at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships\nRublev advanced to the quarterfinals of the Australian Open for the second time, where he then lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic, winning just seven games.[97]\n\n\nRublev reached his first final of the year in Dubai as the defending champion defeating Filip Krajinović, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Botic van de Zandschulp & Alexander Zverev (for the first time) before losing to Daniil Medvedev.[98]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he recorded his 250th career win by defeating Jaume Munar. Rublev became the 25th active men's player to record 250 career wins, the ninth man born in 1990 or later to achieve the feat, and just the fourth man born in 1995 or later to do it after Alexander Zverev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.[99] Following wins over Karen Khachanov, Jan-Lennard Struff, Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune he lifted his first Masters 1000 trophy, the biggest of his career. In the final, Rublev defeated Rune in three sets, coming from 1–4 down in the third set to claim victory.[100]\n\n\nAt the Banja Luka Open, he reached his second consecutive clay court final following wins over Juan Pablo Varillas, Damir Džumhur, and Alex Molčan, but lost to Dušan Lajović in the final in three sets.\nNext, at the 2023 Mutua Madrid Open, he reached the fourth round in singles but lost to compatriot Karen Khachanov. In doubles, the pair went on to win the title after defeating seventh seeds Matthew Ebden/Rohan Bopanna in the final.\n\n\nHe reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon for the first time in his career, defeating Max Purcell, Aslan Karatsev, David Goffin & Alexander Bublik before losing to Novak Djokovic in 4 sets.\nRublev won the Swedish Open, defeating Casper Ruud in the final.[101]\n\n\nSeeded eight at the US Open, Rublev lost to Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals, becoming the first player to lose his first nine Major quarterfinals.[102][103]\n\n\nSeeded fifth at the China Open he reached the second round defeating Cameron Norrie but lost to Ugo Humbert.[104] At the same tournament, in doubles he reached the semifinals with Karen Khachanov.[105]\nAlso seeded fifth at the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he defeated this time 32nd seed Ugo Humbert and 18th seed Grigor Dimitrov to reach his second Masters final of the season.[106] He became the only player, male or female, to record 50 wins in each of the past three years.[107] He lost in the final to 16th seed Hubert Hurkacz.[108]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nRublev is an offensive baseliner with a big forehand – his favorite shot, and has a dangerous and consistent two-handed backhand. His running forehand is particularly lethal because of his consistency and comfort with the shot, making many passing shots with it. Despite his power, Rublev is often hyper-aggressive and can enter situations where he makes consecutive unforced errors, causing technical and mental difficulty to follow. However, he can also demonstrate periods when his forehand is elusive. He states that he does not prefer a particular tennis surface.[16]\n\n\nRublev has a powerful first serve that often reaches 200+ km/h (125+ mph). His second serve, however, is underwhelming because of his high number of double faults during matches, as well as being much slower than his first serve. In 2020, Yevgeny Kafelnikov said the following about Rublev's game: \"I think his whole game, it just has some elements of playing junior tennis, hitting the ball harder and harder. If he improves in those two departments, his footwork and second serve, his whole game is going to change.\"[109]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nRublev has been endorsed by Head for racquets,[110] Italian luxury brand Bulgari for watches, and Penhaligon's for perfume.[111] He used to be endorsed by Wilson for racquets and by Nike for apparel and shoes.[112] In 2023, Rublev launched his own clothing brand Rublo, that is \"not about clothes\". Rublo has been created to drive awareness around equality and kindness with the hope of making our world a better place, as he claims.[113]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nOutside tennis, Rublev practises boxing and basketball, and he is particularly interested in Mike Tyson.[114] Rublev also creates his own electronic music like his idols – Martin Garrix and Alan Walker.[115] Rublev is nicknamed the \"Rubl'\", akin to the Russian word 'ruble'. He speaks Russian, English, and Spanish, and also is a longtime fan of the Golden State Warriors (NBA),[116] and has been regularly following football matches as a supporter of FC Barcelona.[117]\n\n\nRublev is an Orthodox Christian and can be regularly seen crossing himself after matches.[118][119] He is the godfather to Daniil Medvedev’s daughter, Alisa.[120]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Andrey Rublev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner;
