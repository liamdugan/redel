These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.[1]\n\n\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Summer Olympic Games | Winter Olympic Games | Combined total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team

are not equal for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Some sports (such as boxing, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling) award or have previously awarded two bronze medals per competition.\n* Team sports medals, such as in football or basketball count as one, even if there are multiple players on each team, who get a medal.\n* Some tied performances have resulted in multiple medals of the same colour being awarded for an event. If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\n* Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\n* Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\n* Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n## List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, 68 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal. Seven historic National Olympic Committees and the Refugee Olympic Team are also included in this list.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team (IOC code)\n | No. Summer\n | No. Winter\n | No. Games\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Albania (ALB) | 9 | 5 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) American Samoa (ASA) | 9 | 2 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Andorra (AND) | 12 | 13 | 25\n |\n| ![](image) Angola (ANG) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Antigua and Barbuda (ANT) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba (ARU) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh (BAN) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Belize (BIZ) [BIZ] | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Benin (BEN) [BEN] | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Bhutan (BHU) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Bolivia (BOL) | 15 | 7 | 22\n |\n| ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) | 8 | 8 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) British Virgin Islands (IVB) | 10 | 2 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Brunei (BRU) [A] | 6 | 0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Cambodia (CAM) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Cape Verde (CPV) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Cayman Islands (CAY) | 11 | 2 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic (CAF) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Chad (CHA) | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Comoros (COM) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of the Congo (CGO) | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Democratic Republic of the Congo (COD) [COD] | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Cook Islands (COK) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Dominica (DMA) | 7 | 1 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) El Salvador (ESA) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![Eswatini](image) Eswatini (SWZ) [SWZ] | 11 | 1 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Equatorial Guinea (GEQ) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) The Gambia (GAM) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Guam (GUM) | 9 | 1 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Guinea (GUI) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Guinea-Bissau (GBS) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Honduras (HON) | 12 | 1 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Kiribati (KIR) | 5 | 0 | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Laos (LAO) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Lesotho (LES) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Liberia (LBR) [C] | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Libya (LBA) [D] | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Madagascar (MAD) | 13 | 3 | 16\n |\n| ![](image) Malawi (MAW) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Maldives (MDV) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Mali (MLI) | 14 | 0 | 14\n |\n| ![](image) Malta (MLT) | 17 | 3 | 20\n |\n| ![](image) Marshall Islands (MHL) | 4 | 0 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Mauritania (MTN) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) | 6 | 0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Monaco (MON) [N] | 21 | 11 | 32\n |\n| ![](image) Myanmar (MYA) [MYA] | 18 | 0 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Nauru (NRU) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Nepal (NEP)[a] | 14 | 4 | 18\n |\n| ![](image) Nicaragua (NCA) | 13 | 0 | 13\n |\n| ![](image) Oman (OMA) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Palau (PLW) | 6 | 0 | 6\n |\n| ![](image) Palestine (PLE) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Papua New Guinea (PNG) | 11 | 0 | 11\n |\n| ![](image) Rwanda (RWA) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Saint Kitts and Nevis (SKN) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Saint Lucia (LCA) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (VIN) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) | 7 | 0 | 7\n |\n| ![](image) Seychelles (SEY) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Sierra Leone (SLE) | 12 | 0 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Solomon Islands (SOL) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia (SOM) | 10 | 0 | 10\n |\n| ![](image) South Sudan (SSD) | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) East Timor (TLS) [I] | 5 | 3 | 8\n |\n| ![](image) Tuvalu (TUV) | 4 | 0 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Vanuatu (VAN) | 9 | 0 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Yemen (YEM) [YEM] | 8 | 0 | 8\n |\n| *![](image) Korea (COR)* | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| *![Federation of Malaya](image) Malaya (MAL)* [MAL] | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n| *![](image) North Borneo (NBO)* [NBO] | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| *![](image) Republic of China (ROC)* [ROC] | 3 | 0 | 3\n |\n| *![](image) Saar (SAA)* [SAA] | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| *![](image) North Yemen (YAR)* [YAR] | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n| *![](image) South Yemen (YMD)* [YMD] | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| *![](image) Refugee Olympic Team (ROT)* [ROT] | 2 | 0 | 2\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Tejbir Bura was the first and only Nepalese person to receive an Olympic gold medal.

combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals in the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\n\n### Early Olympics[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC. Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg.[4]\n\n\nOther differences from the official table are based on disagreements about which events were Olympic. This affects several of the events in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics. In addition, some sources include the 1906 Intercalated Games when compiling their medal tables.[5]\n\n\n\n### Alpinism and aeronautics[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad. In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn. In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done.[2][6][7][8] Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\n\n\n\n### Australasia[edit]\n\n\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1904 | ![](image) Australia (AUS) |  |\n| 1908–1912 | ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) |\n| 1920– | ![](image) Australia (AUS) | ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Australia (AUS) | 27 | 164 | 173 | 210 | 547 | 20 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 19 | 47 | 170 | 180 | 216 | 566\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) | 24 | 53 | 33 | 51 | 137 | 17 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 41 | 55 | 35 | 53 | 143\n |\n| Total\n | 29 | 220 | 210 | 266 | 696 | 20 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 25 | 49 | 228 | 219 | 274 | 721\n |\n\n\n### British West Indies[edit]\n\n\nThe West Indies Federation,[9][10] also known as the West Indies,[11][12] the Federation of the West Indies[13] or the West Indian Federation,[14][15][16] was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state[17]\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\n\n\nAthletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT),[18] \nrenamed to British West Indies (BWI) by the IOC, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors—two from Barbados, four from Trinidad, and seven from Jamaica—all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports.[19] The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1948–1956 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1960 | ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1968– | ![](image) Barbados (BAR) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | 18 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88\n |\n| ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) | 18 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Barbados (BAR) | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 18 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110\n |\n\n\n### Czechoslovakia[edit]\n\n\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896 |  | *as part of ![](image) Hungary* |\n| 1900–1912 | *as ![](image) Bohemia (BOH)* |\n| 1920–1992 | **![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH)** |\n| 1996– | ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Bohemia (BOH) | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH) | 16 | 49 | 49 | 45 | 143 | 16 | 2 | 8 | 15 | 25 | 32 | 51 | 57 | 60 | 168\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | 7 | 19 | 22 | 26 | 67 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 13 | 34 | 15 | 29 | 33 | 39 | 101\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) | 7 | 10 | 14 | 8 | 32 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 | 15 | 14 | 18 | 10 | 42\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 78 | 86 | 82 | 246 | 24 | 16 | 23 | 30 | 69 | 50 | 94 | 109 | 112 | 315\n |\n\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was denied participation on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896–1912 | **![German Empire](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1920–1924 | *denied participation* |\n| 1928–1936 | **![Weimar Republic](image) ![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1948 | *denied participation* |\n| 1952 | ![](image) Saar (SAA) | ![](image) Germany (GER) |\n| 1956–1964 | ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) |\n| 1968–1988 | ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | ![](image) East Germany (GDR) |\n| 1992– | **![](image) Germany (GER)** |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) Germany (GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Saar (SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image) East Germany (GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n### Kuwait[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference.[20][21][22]\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag.

Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the Netherlands Antilles. Since the Olympic Games in 1988, athletes from Aruba have competed separately under their own Olympic banner and have participated in each Summer Olympic Games since then.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands as special municipalities of the Netherlands. Curaçao and Sint Maarten became separate constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \nAt the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.\nHowever, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality).[24] Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1948 | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |  |\n| 1952–1984 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) |\n| 1988–2008 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | ![](image) Aruba (ARU) |\n| 2012 | *as part of ![](image) Netherlands* / ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) |\n| 2014– | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands (NED) | 27 | 95 | 105 | 122 | 322 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 154 | 167 | 469\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | 13 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba (ARU) | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 27 | 95 | 106 | 122 | 323 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 155 | 167 | 470\n |\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of *China*. After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics. It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result. The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe Republic of China took part in the Opening Ceremony of the 1924 Summer Olympics, but its four athletes, all of whom were tennis players, withdrew from competition.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1924–1948 | **![](image) Republic of China (ROC)** |\n| 1952 | ![](image) China (CHN) |  |\n| 1956– | ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of China (ROC) | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) China (CHN) | 11 | 263 | 199 | 174 | 636 | 12 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 23 | 285 | 231 | 197 | 713\n |\n| ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) | 15 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 28 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36\n |\n| Total\n | 19 | 270 | 210 | 192 | 672 | 14 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 33 | 292 | 242 | 215 | 749\n |\n\n\n### Russia and the Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources. The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992.[26][27][28] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS.[29][30] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union,[31] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1912 |

Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. *Yugoslavia* has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\n\n\n* Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially called the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) from 1920–1936\n* Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1948 to the 1992 Winter Olympics\n* Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a joint state by only Montenegro and Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1996 to 2002\n\n\nThe United Nations[32] affirmed that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was a new state. All former republics were entitled to state succession, while none of them continued SFR Yugoslavia's international legal personality. As a result of the U.N. resolution, individual FRY athletes were allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and FRY was not allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia*, consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996[33] and 2000[34] Games, the nation was designated with the same code, *Yugoslavia* (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The *Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games.[35]\n\n\nTwo of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1912 | *as part of ![](image) Austria* |  | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) |  |\n| 1920–1936 | ![Kingdom of Yugoslavia](image) Kingdom of Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1948–1988 | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 W | ![](image) Croatia (CRO) | ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 S | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) | ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) |\n| 1994 | *ban on participation by the UN* |\n| 1996–2006 | ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) | ![Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) FR Yugoslavia (YUG)/![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) |\n| 2008–2014 | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) |\n| 2016– | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Serbia (SRB) (1912, 2008–current) | 5 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Yugoslavia (YUG) (1920–1992 *w*) | 16 | 26 | 29 | 28 | 83 | 14 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 30 | 26 | 32 | 29 | 87\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) (1992 *s*) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) (1996–2006) | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia (CRO) (1992–current) | 8 | 14 | 13 | 14 | 41 | 9 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 11 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 15 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) (1992–current) | 8 | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 | 9 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 24 | 17 | 12 | 17 | 23 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) (1992 *s* –current) | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) (1996–current) | 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 14 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) (2008–current) | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) (2016–current) | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3\n |\n| Total\n | 25 | 59 | 65 | 70 | 194 | 22 | 8 | 17 | 14 | 39 | 47 | 67 | 82 | 84 | 233\n |\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes.

The *West Indies Federation* only existed as a nation from 1958–1962, so the constituent nations once again competed independently in 1964.\n* **SAA** , **EUA** , **GDR** , **FRG** → **GER** Germany (GER) competed 1896–1952 and from 1992. Due to the partition of Germany after World War II, Germany was represented by two teams at the 1952 Games — Germany (GER) and the *Saar* (SAA). The Saar was reintegrated back into the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957, and Saar athletes then competed for Germany. *East Germany* did not contribute athletes to the 1952 team, as the National Olympic Committee for the German Democratic Republic was only granted \"provisional\" recognition by the IOC in 1955. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a *United Team of Germany* (EUA), representing the National Olympic Committees of both *West Germany* and *East Germany*. Retrospectively, the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, *East Germany* (GDR) and *West Germany* (FRG) competed as two independent teams from the 1968 to the 1988 Games.\n* **MAL** , **NBO** → **MAS** Athletes from *Malaya* (MAL) and *North Borneo* (NBO) competed as independent teams at the 1956 Games and Malaya also competed at the 1960 Games, prior to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia (MAS) in 1963.\n* **AHO** The *Netherlands Antilles* (AHO), an autonomous country within the Netherlands (NED), competed 1952–2008. The Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee's membership in the IOC was withdrawn in 2011 because of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.\n* **RU1** → **URS** → **EUN** → **RUS** *Russian Empire* (RU1) participated at the 1900, 1908 and 1912 Games prior to World War I. The *Soviet Union* (URS) competed from 1952 to 1988. *Unified Team* (EUN) is the generic name used for a combined team of six post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics and a combined team of twelve post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics. *Russian Federation* (RUS) and the other fourteen post-Soviet republics started competing independently in 1992 (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), 1994 or 1996.\n | * **SRB** , **YUG to 1992** , **YUG/SCG** Serbia (SRB, 1912, 2006–current) first participated at the Olympic Games in 1912. *Yugoslavia* (YUG, 1920–1992 Winter) competed as *Kingdom of Yugoslavia* (officially the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) in five Games (1920–1936) before the Second World War. They later competed as *Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia* for the Games (1948–1992 Winter). This ended with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Some ex-Yugoslavian nations (Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) have competed as independent teams since 1992. Individual athletes from the *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)* competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP) at the 1992 Summer Games because of sanctions placed by the United Nations. Athletes representing Macedonia likewise competed as Independent Olympic Participants that year because their NOC had not yet been formed, but since 1996 Macedonia has competed as an independent team. The team of the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG, 2004–2006) consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, until 2006 when Montenegro seceded from the Union. This team competed as *Yugoslavia* (YUG) from 1996–2002 and then changed to *Serbia and Montenegro* (2004–2006). After 96 years Serbia returned to the Olympics as an independent team at the 2008 Games. Montenegro first participated as an independent team in 2008.\n* **YAR** , **YMD** → **YEM** Prior to Yemeni unification in 1990, *North Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Arab Republic* (YAR) in 1984 and 1988, and *South Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Democratic Republic* (YMD) at the 1988 Games. After forming united republic Yemen (YEM) has participated since 1992.\n* **ROC** → **CHN** , **TPE** The *Republic of China* was designated as *China* at the 1932, 1936, and 1948 Games and was representing all of China (including Taiwan). After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China (CHN) and Chinese Taipei (TPE) have participated as separate teams.\n* **ZZX** Special code used by the IOC to refer to medals won by athletes of multiple nations competing together, which was common in early Games (1896–1904). These medals are not included in the respective totals for each nation represented by individual mixed team athletes.\n* **IOP** , **IOA** , **OAR** , **ROC** Special codes used by the IOC for athletes whose NOC is not recognized by IOC. At the 1992 Summer Olympics fifty eight athletes from former Yugoslavia competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2000 Summer Olympics four athletes from East Timor competed as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2012 Summer Olympics three athletes from former Netherlands Antilles and one athlete from South Sudan competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2014 Winter Olympics three athletes from India competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2018 Winter Olympics 168 athletes from Russia competed as *Olympics Athletes from Russia* (OAR). Since the 2020 Summer Olympics athletes from Russia are competing as *Russian Olympic Committee* (ROC).\n\n\n |\n\n### Name changes notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **BIZ** Belize participated under its former name of *British Honduras* (HBR) in 1968 and 1972.\n* **BEN** Benin was known as *Dahomey* (DAH) in 1972.\n* **BUR** Burkina Faso was known as *Upper Volta* (VOL) in 1972.\n* **TPE2** After the Chinese Civil War, Chinese Taipei (TPE) participated using the name of the *Republic of China* at the 1956, 1960, 1972 and 1976 (winter) Games and using *Taiwan* designation at the 1964 and 1968 Games. In 1979, the IOC started to use *Chinese Taipei* to refer to the NOC, a compromise that was acceptable for the People's Republic of China (CHN) that led to the start of its participation in the Olympic Games. The name Chinese Taipei was first used in 1984. Participation of the *Republic of China*, representing all of China (including Taiwan), in 1932, 1936 and 1948 Games are not counted in Taiwan's total participation count.\n* **COD** The Democratic Republic of the Congo was known as *Zaire* (ZAI) between 1984 and 1996.\n* **CIV** Côte d'Ivoire was known as *Ivory Coast* between 1964 and 1988.\n* **EGY** Egypt participated as the *United Arab Republic* (UAR) between 1960 and 1968.\n* **GBR** Includes medals won by athletes from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1896–1920) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1924–present), both of which used the name \"Great Britain\" and the country code GBR.\n | * **GHA** Prior to Ghana's independence in 1957, *Gold Coast* participated in the 1952 Games.\n* **GUY** Prior to Guyana's independence in 1966, *British Guiana* participated from 1948 to 1964.\n* **HKG** Totals of Hong Kong (HKG) includes all medals won by athletes representing the Hong Kong National Olympic Committee, designated as \"Hong Kong\" from 1952–1996 and \"Hong Kong, China\" since 2000.\n* **MKD** North Macedonia was known as *Macedonia*, or more formally *the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* due to a naming dispute with Greece, between 1996 and 2018.\n* **MYA** Myanmar was known as *Burma* (BIR) between 1948 and 1988.\n* **SAM** Samoa was known as *Western Samoa* between 1984 and 1996.\n* **SRI** Sri Lanka was known as *Ceylon* (CEY) between 1948 and 1972.\n* **SWZ** Eswatini was known as *Swaziland* between 1972 and 2016.\n* **TAN** Although Tanganyika and Zanzibar had already merged to form Tanzania in April 1964, the nation was designated *Tanganyika* in the official report of the 1964 Games.\n* **ZAM** Zambia achieved independence on the last day of the 1964 Games, but had participated as *Northern Rhodesia* (NRH) during those Games.\n* **ZIM** Prior to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, *Southern Rhodesia* participated as *Rhodesia* (RHO) in 1928, 1960, and 1964 Games.\n\n\n |\n\n### Participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **A** Brunei's participation in the 1988 Games consisted only of a single official, but no competing athletes. This participation is not counted in Brunei's participation total.\n* **B** Djibouti at the 2004 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but neither athlete competed, so this participation is not counted in Djibouti's participation total.\n* **C** Liberia's athletes withdrew from 1980 Games after marching in the Opening Ceremony and took part in the boycott. This participation is not counted in Liberia's participation total.\n* **D** Libya marched in the opening ceremony of the 1964 Games, but then withdrew from competition. This participation is not counted in Libya's participation total.\n* **E** Suriname at the 1960 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but its lone athlete withdrew from Games due to a scheduling error. Participation of Suriname at the 1960 Games not recognized by IOC, so this participation is not counted in Suriname's participation total.\n | * **F** India's athletes originally competed at the 2014 Games as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremony due to the Indian Olympic Association's suspension. On February 11, 2014, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.\n* **Ia** **Ib** Does not include the participation of East Timor's and Netherlands Antilles's athletes as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA) at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n* **Za** **Zb** **Zc** **Zd** **Ze** **Zf** **Zg** **Zh** **Zi** **Zj** **Zk** **Zl** **Zm** Does not include medals won as part of mixed teams with athletes from other nations (1896–1904).\n\n\n |\n\n### Disputed participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **H** The Bulgarian Olympic Committee claims that Charles Champaud, a Swiss gymnastics teacher living in Sofia, competed for the nation in 1896. Bulgarian participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **I** The Chilean Olympic Committee claims that Luis Subercaseaux Errázuriz, a Chilean diplomat and athlete, competed for the nation in 1896. Chilean participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **J** Some sources consider Léon Thiércelin, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Haitian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Haiti. Participation of Haiti at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Haiti's participation total.\n* **K** Some sources consider Freydoun Malkom, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Persian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Iran. Participation of Iran at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Iran's participation total.\n* **L** Some sources consider Carlos de Candamo, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Peruvian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Peru. Participation of Peru at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Peru's participation total.\n* **M** Enrico Brusoni's gold medal in the Cycling Men's Points Race at the 1900 Summer Olympics[36] is recognized by the Italian National Olympic Committee as well as the IOC[37] as being won in a 1900 Summer Olympics event, although some sources state it was unofficial.[38]\n* **N** Monaco earned a bronze in the art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics.[39] However, medals in art competitions are no longer recognized by the IOC.[40]\n* **Oa** **Ob** Michel Théato, a French athlete who won the gold medal in marathon at the 1900 Games, was born in Luxembourg.[4] The IOC does not recognize Luxembourg participation at the 1900 Games and attributes his medal to France.\n | The nationalities of many medalists at the 1904 Olympics are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.\n* **Pa** **Pb** Sources are inconsistent regarding Albert Corey's participation in 1904, who immigrated to the United States from France. The Games report refers to Corey as a \"Frenchman wearing the colors of the Chicago Athletic Association\", but the IOC attributes his medal in the marathon to the United States, and in contradiction, the medal in the four mile team race (that was won by a team of three Americans and Corey) to a mixed team composed of athletes from multiple nations instead of just the United States.[41]\n* **Qa** **Qb** The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen who immigrated from Norway to the United States to have competed for the United States. Each man won a gold medal.[42] In 2012, Norwegian historians however found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen, who was registered as an \"alien\" (foreigner) as late as 1925, probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians.[43][44] In May 2013 it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database.[45]\n* **R** Bob Fowler, an American marathon runner who competed at the 1904 Games, was a native Newfoundlander, Newfoundland is occasionally listed as a separate country at the 1904 Olympics, and would be listed as an historical NOC without medals.[46] Participation of Newfoundland at the 1904 Games is not recognized by the IOC.\n* **S** In 2009, historians from the International Society of Olympic Historians discovered that cyclist Frank Bizzoni was an Italian citizen when he competed in 1904 being granted US citizenship in 1917.[47][48] However, the IOC does not officially recognize Italy's participation in the 1904 Olympics.\n* **Fm** The IOC counts one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals won by American fencer Albertson Van Zo Post for Cuba instead of the United States. The one silver and one bronze medal won by American Charles Tatham are also counted for Cuba instead of the United States.\n\n\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Olympic Games - Sochi 2014 | Winter Summer Past and Future Olympics\".

These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.\nThe IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from the IOC database.[1]\n\n\nThe results are attributed to the IOC country code as currently displayed by the IOC database. Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nThe table is pre-sorted by the name of each Olympic Committee, but can be displayed as sorted by any other column, such as the total number of gold medals or total number of overall medals. To sort by gold, silver, and then bronze, sort first by the bronze column, then the silver, and then the gold. The table does not count revoked medals (e.g., due to doping).\n\n\nA total of 156 current and historical NOCs have earned at least one medal. Medal totals in this table are current through the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, People's Republic of China, and all changes in medal standings due to doping cases and medal redistributions up to 5 May 2023 are taken into account.\n\n\n\nSpecial delegation, not an actual nation\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Summer Olympic Games | Winter Olympic Games | Combined total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team

are not equal for the following reasons:\n\n\n\n* Some sports (such as boxing, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling) award or have previously awarded two bronze medals per competition.\n* Team sports medals, such as in football or basketball count as one, even if there are multiple players on each team, who get a medal.\n* Some tied performances have resulted in multiple medals of the same colour being awarded for an event. If this tie is for gold or silver, there will be a consequent absence of a silver or bronze medal for that event.\n* Some medals that have been revoked have not been re-awarded.\n* Some early events, such as cricket at the 1900 Summer Olympics, had only two entrants.\n* Retroactively awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals for the 1896 and 1900 games results in some anomalies, such as the 100 metre freestyle swimming event in 1896 where no surviving records distinguish the places of those who finished between 3rd and 10th position.\n\n\n## List of NOCs without medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, 68 of the current 206 National Olympic Committees have yet to win an Olympic medal.

combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals in the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\n\n### Early Olympics[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC. Only one of these cases concerns a medal. A gold medal that is officially added to France's total is given to Luxembourg.[4]\n\n\nOther differences from the official table are based on disagreements about which events were Olympic. This affects several of the events in the 1900 and 1904 Olympics. In addition, some sources include the 1906 Intercalated Games when compiling their medal tables.[5]\n\n\n\n### Alpinism and aeronautics[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1924 through 1936, the IOC on several occasions awarded gold medals for feats of alpinism and aeronautics that occurred in the preceding four-year Olympiad. In 1924, 1932 and 1936, gold medals were awarded to 25 mountaineers from six nations for expeditions in the Himalayas and the Matterhorn. In 1936, a gold medal was awarded to Hermann Schreiber of Switzerland for crossing the Alps in a glider in 1935, the first time that had been done.[2][6][7][8] Some sources include these IOC awards of gold medals in the overall count.\n\n\n\n### Australasia[edit]\n\n\nAustralasia was a combined team of athletes from Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand that competed together at the 1908 and 1912 Summer Olympics. When the Olympic Games resumed in 1920 after World War I, the two nations sent separate teams to the Games, and have done so ever since.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1904 | ![](image) Australia (AUS) |  |\n| 1908–1912 | ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) |\n| 1920– | ![](image) Australia (AUS) | ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Australasia (ANZ) | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 12\n |\n| ![](image) Australia (AUS) | 27 | 164 | 173 | 210 | 547 | 20 | 6 | 7 | 6 | 19 | 47 | 170 | 180 | 216 | 566\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand (NZL) | 24 | 53 | 33 | 51 | 137 | 17 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 41 | 55 | 35 | 53 | 143\n |\n| Total\n | 29 | 220 | 210 | 266 | 696 | 20 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 25 | 49 | 228 | 219 | 274 | 721\n |\n\n\n### British West Indies[edit]\n\n\nThe West Indies Federation,[9][10] also known as the West Indies,[11][12] the Federation of the West Indies[13] or the West Indian Federation,[14][15][16] was a short-lived political union that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. Various islands in the Caribbean that were part of the British Empire, including Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, and those on the Leeward and Windward Islands, came together to form the Federation.The expressed intention of the Federation was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state[17]\nBefore that could happen, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed or function viably.\n\n\nAthletes from the West Indies Federation competed under the name Antilles (ANT),[18] \nrenamed to British West Indies (BWI) by the IOC, at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Thirteen competitors—two from Barbados, four from Trinidad, and seven from Jamaica—all men, took part in thirteen events in five sports.[19] The short-lived nation only participated at these single Games, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago competed independently again in 1964, and Barbados started competing at the 1968 Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1948–1956 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1960 | ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) |  |\n| 1968– | ![](image) Barbados (BAR) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Winter Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) British West Indies (BWI) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica (JAM) | 18 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 26 | 36 | 26 | 88\n |\n| ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago (TTO) | 18 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 3 | 5 | 11 | 19\n |\n| ![](image) Barbados (BAR) | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n |\n| Total\n | 18 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 27 | 29 | 41 | 40 | 110\n |\n\n\n### Czechoslovakia[edit]\n\n\nCzechoslovakia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920, after having competed as Bohemia from 1900 to 1912. The nation sent athletes to compete in every Summer Olympic Games since then, except for the 1984 Games when they were part of the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics. Czechoslovakia has participated in every Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games of 1924.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia sent independent teams to the Olympics starting in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896 |  | *as part of ![](image) Hungary* |\n| 1900–1912 | *as ![](image) Bohemia (BOH)* |\n| 1920–1992 | **![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH)** |\n| 1996– | ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Bohemia (BOH) | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 4\n |\n| ![](image) Czechoslovakia (TCH) | 16 | 49 | 49 | 45 | 143 | 16 | 2 | 8 | 15 | 25 | 32 | 51 | 57 | 60 | 168\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic (CZE) | 7 | 19 | 22 | 26 | 67 | 8 | 10 | 11 | 13 | 34 | 15 | 29 | 33 | 39 | 101\n |\n| ![](image) Slovakia (SVK) | 7 | 10 | 14 | 8 | 32 | 8 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 10 | 15 | 14 | 18 | 10 | 42\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 78 | 86 | 82 | 246 | 24 | 16 | 23 | 30 | 69 | 50 | 94 | 109 | 112 | 315\n |\n\n\n### Germany[edit]\n\n\nGermany has competed under five different designations, including as two separate teams at several Games. Sources vary in how they present the medals won by these teams. The table below shows sourced combinations of these teams, when applied to the updated medal totals from the main table. A part of Germany, Saar, competed independently in the Summer Olympic games in 1952, but failed to win any medals. Due to most lists only listing medal counts, it's possible but not certain Saar was included as part of Germany in their calculations. Germany was denied participation on three occasions (1920, 1924, and 1948).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1896–1912 | **![German Empire](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1920–1924 | *denied participation* |\n| 1928–1936 | **![Weimar Republic](image) ![Nazi Germany](image) Germany (GER)** |\n| 1948 | *denied participation* |\n| 1952 | ![](image) Saar (SAA) | ![](image) Germany (GER) |\n| 1956–1964 | ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) |\n| 1968–1988 | ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | ![](image) East Germany (GDR) |\n| 1992– | **![](image) Germany (GER)** |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) Germany (GER) | 17 | 201 | 207 | 247 | 655 | 13 | 104 | 98 | 65 | 267 | 30 | 305 | 305 | 312 | 922\n |\n| ![](image) Saar (SAA) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) United Team of Germany (EUA) | 3 | 28 | 54 | 36 | 118 | 3 | 8 | 6 | 5 | 19 | 6 | 36 | 60 | 41 | 137\n |\n| ![](image) East Germany (GDR) | 5 | 153 | 129 | 127 | 409 | 6 | 39 | 36 | 35 | 110 | 11 | 192 | 165 | 162 | 519\n |\n| ![](image) West Germany (FRG) | 5 | 56 | 67 | 81 | 204 | 6 | 11 | 15 | 13 | 39 | 11 | 67 | 82 | 94 | 243\n |\n| Total\n | 26 | 438 | 457 | 491 | 1386 | 22 | 162 | 155 | 118 | 435 | 48 | 600 | 612 | 609 | 1821\n |\n\n\n### Kuwait[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA), as the Kuwait Olympic Committee had been suspended by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the second time in five years due to governmental interference.[20][21][22]\nAlthough not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the nation's participants were able to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes under the Olympic flag.

Between 1952 until 1984, Aruban athletes competed as part of the Netherlands Antilles. Since the Olympic Games in 1988, athletes from Aruba have competed separately under their own Olympic banner and have participated in each Summer Olympic Games since then.\n\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became part of the Netherlands as special municipalities of the Netherlands. Curaçao and Sint Maarten became separate constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. \nAt the 2012 Olympics, participants from the five islands competed as independent athletes under the Olympic flag.\nHowever, athletes from the former Netherlands Antilles who qualified for the 2012 Olympics were allowed to participate independently under the Olympic flag, in addition to the possibility of competing for the Netherlands (as for example Churandy Martina did) or Aruba (because they have Dutch nationality).[24] Ultimately, three athletes from the Netherlands Antilles participated as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1948 | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |  |\n| 1952–1984 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) |\n| 1988–2008 | ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | ![](image) Aruba (ARU) |\n| 2012 | *as part of ![](image) Netherlands* / ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) |\n| 2014– | ![](image) Netherlands (NED) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands (NED) | 27 | 95 | 105 | 122 | 322 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 154 | 167 | 469\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands Antilles (AHO) | 13 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Aruba (ARU) | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Athletes (IOA) (2012) | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| Total\n | 27 | 95 | 106 | 122 | 323 | 22 | 53 | 49 | 45 | 147 | 49 | 148 | 155 | 167 | 470\n |\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nThe Republic of China (ROC) participated in its first Summer Olympics in 1932 under the name of *China*. After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949, and only Taiwan-based athletes have competed on its behalf since then. In 1971, the ROC was expelled from the United Nations, but was permitted to compete under its official name, flag, and anthem in the 1972 Winter, 1972 Summer, and 1976 Winter Olympics. It was denied official representation in the 1976 Summer Olympics and boycotted it as a result. The 1979 Nagoya Resolution allowed the ROC to compete under the deliberately-ambiguous name \"Chinese Taipei\"; it protested against this decision and boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics as well, but has competed under this name since the 1984 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe Republic of China took part in the Opening Ceremony of the 1924 Summer Olympics, but its four athletes, all of whom were tennis players, withdrew from competition.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1924–1948 | **![](image) Republic of China (ROC)** |\n| 1952 | ![](image) China (CHN) |  |\n| 1956– | ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Republic of China (ROC) | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) China (CHN) | 11 | 263 | 199 | 174 | 636 | 12 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 23 | 285 | 231 | 197 | 713\n |\n| ![](image) Chinese Taipei (TPE) | 15 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 28 | 7 | 11 | 18 | 36\n |\n| Total\n | 19 | 270 | 210 | 192 | 672 | 14 | 22 | 32 | 23 | 77 | 33 | 292 | 242 | 215 | 749\n |\n\n\n### Russia and the Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Federation, the Russian Empire, the Olympic Athletes from Russia and the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) are sometimes combined outside of IOC sources. The Soviet Union is often combined with the post-union team that competed in 1992.[26][27][28] Some sources combine the Soviet Union and Russia, despite the fact that many republics which subsequently gained or re-gained independence (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) contributed to the medal tally of the USSR, and there are sources that combine all medals of RU1, URS, EUN, OAR, ROC and RUS.[29][30] On 31 January 1992, the United Nations recognized, without objection, Russia as legal successor of the rights and obligations of the former Soviet Union,[31] but this has no significance in medal tallies.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1900–1912 |

Yugoslavia first participated at the Olympic Games in 1920. *Yugoslavia* has been the designation for Olympic teams from three distinct national entities:\n\n\n\n* Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially called the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) from 1920–1936\n* Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1948 to the 1992 Winter Olympics\n* Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, formed as a joint state by only Montenegro and Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia, from 1996 to 2002\n\n\nThe United Nations[32] affirmed that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) was a new state. All former republics were entitled to state succession, while none of them continued SFR Yugoslavia's international legal personality. As a result of the U.N. resolution, individual FRY athletes were allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Participants at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and FRY was not allowed to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia*, consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games since 1996. At the 1996[33] and 2000[34] Games, the nation was designated with the same code, *Yugoslavia* (YUG), as the defunct SFRY. It was rechartered as the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* in 2003 with there being no territorial changes. The *Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG) designation and code were used at the 2004 Games.[35]\n\n\nTwo of the successor nations (Croatia and Slovenia) began to compete as independent teams at the Olympics starting at the 1992 Winter Games and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 1992 Summer Games and as of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six successor nations, former socialist republics, have participated independently. Kosovo, a former autonomous province, made its Olympic debut as an independent national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date | Team\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1912 | *as part of ![](image) Austria* |  | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) |  |\n| 1920–1936 | ![Kingdom of Yugoslavia](image) Kingdom of Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1948–1988 | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 W | ![](image) Croatia (CRO) | ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) | ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) SFR Yugoslavia (YUG) |\n| 1992 S | ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) | ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) |\n| 1994 | *ban on participation by the UN* |\n| 1996–2006 | ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) | ![Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) FR Yugoslavia (YUG)/![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) |\n| 2008–2014 | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) |\n| 2016– | ![](image) Serbia (SRB) | ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) |\n\n\n**Medal counts:**  \n\n*status after the 2022 Olympics*\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Summer Games\n | Winter Games\n | Combined total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Team (IOC code) | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | No.\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Serbia (SRB) (1912, 2008–current) | 5 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 6 | 7 | 11 | 24\n |\n| ![](image) ![](image) Yugoslavia (YUG) (1920–1992 *w*) | 16 | 26 | 29 | 28 | 83 | 14 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 4 | 30 | 26 | 32 | 29 | 87\n |\n| ![](image) Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) (1992 *s*) | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) (1996–2006) | 3 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 9\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia (CRO) (1992–current) | 8 | 14 | 13 | 14 | 41 | 9 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 11 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 15 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Slovenia (SLO) (1992–current) | 8 | 8 | 9 | 11 | 28 | 9 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 24 | 17 | 12 | 17 | 23 | 52\n |\n| ![](image) Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) (1992 *s* –current) | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| ![](image) North Macedonia (MKD) (1996–current) | 7 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 14 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2\n |\n| ![](image) Montenegro (MNE) (2008–current) | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1\n |\n| ![](image) Kosovo (KOS) (2016–current) | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3\n |\n| Total\n | 25 | 59 | 65 | 70 | 194 | 22 | 8 | 17 | 14 | 39 | 47 | 67 | 82 | 84 | 233\n |\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the teams of Independent Olympians at the Olympic Games mentioned above—Kuwait, Russia, the former Netherlands Antilles, and the former Yugoslavia—several other NOCs were represented by independent Olympic athletes. East Timor's team in 2000 consisted of four athletes competing as Individual Olympic Athletes. In 2012, one independent Olympic athlete represented South Sudan. In the 2014 Winter Olympics, the team from India included one independent Olympic participant.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n### Obsolete nations notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **ANZ** → **AUS** , **NZL** *Australasia* (ANZ) was a combined team of athletes from Australia (AUS) and New Zealand (NZL). They competed together during the 1908 and 1912 Games.\n* **BOH** → **TCH** → **CZE** , **SVK** Prior to the foundation of *Czechoslovakia* (TCH) after World War I, athletes from *Bohemia* (BOH) (now part of the present-day Czech Republic) competed in 1900, 1908, and 1912 Games. *Czechoslovakia* competed in 1920–1992, from 1994 represented by successor NOCs of Czech Republic (CZE) and Slovakia (SVK).\n* **BWI** → **BAR** , **JAM** , **TTO** Athletes from Barbados (BAR), Jamaica (JAM), and Trinidad and Tobago (TRI) competed as the *British West Indies* (BWI) at the 1960 Games. The *West Indies Federation* only existed as a nation from 1958–1962, so the constituent nations once again competed independently in 1964.\n* **SAA** , **EUA** , **GDR** , **FRG** → **GER** Germany (GER) competed 1896–1952 and from 1992. Due to the partition of Germany after World War II, Germany was represented by two teams at the 1952 Games — Germany (GER) and the *Saar* (SAA). The Saar was reintegrated back into the Federal Republic of Germany on 1 January 1957, and Saar athletes then competed for Germany. *East Germany* did not contribute athletes to the 1952 team, as the National Olympic Committee for the German Democratic Republic was only granted \"provisional\" recognition by the IOC in 1955. For the Games of 1956–1964, Germany participated as a *United Team of Germany* (EUA), representing the National Olympic Committees of both *West Germany* and *East Germany*. Retrospectively, the IOC uses the country code EUA for this team. After the NOC for the German Democratic Republic was granted full recognition by the IOC in 1968, *East Germany* (GDR) and *West Germany* (FRG) competed as two independent teams from the 1968 to the 1988 Games.\n* **MAL** , **NBO** → **MAS** Athletes from *Malaya* (MAL) and *North Borneo* (NBO) competed as independent teams at the 1956 Games and Malaya also competed at the 1960 Games, prior to the formation of the Federation of Malaysia (MAS) in 1963.\n* **AHO** The *Netherlands Antilles* (AHO), an autonomous country within the Netherlands (NED), competed 1952–2008. The Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee's membership in the IOC was withdrawn in 2011 because of the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.\n* **RU1** → **URS** → **EUN** → **RUS** *Russian Empire* (RU1) participated at the 1900, 1908 and 1912 Games prior to World War I. The *Soviet Union* (URS) competed from 1952 to 1988. *Unified Team* (EUN) is the generic name used for a combined team of six post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics and a combined team of twelve post-Soviet republics that competed at the 1992 Summer Olympics. *Russian Federation* (RUS) and the other fourteen post-Soviet republics started competing independently in 1992 (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia), 1994 or 1996.\n | * **SRB** , **YUG to 1992** , **YUG/SCG** Serbia (SRB, 1912, 2006–current) first participated at the Olympic Games in 1912. *Yugoslavia* (YUG, 1920–1992 Winter) competed as *Kingdom of Yugoslavia* (officially the *Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes* until 1929) in five Games (1920–1936) before the Second World War. They later competed as *Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia* for the Games (1948–1992 Winter). This ended with the breakup of Yugoslavia. Some ex-Yugoslavian nations (Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina) have competed as independent teams since 1992. Individual athletes from the *Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)* competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP) at the 1992 Summer Games because of sanctions placed by the United Nations. Athletes representing Macedonia likewise competed as Independent Olympic Participants that year because their NOC had not yet been formed, but since 1996 Macedonia has competed as an independent team. The team of the *State Union of Serbia and Montenegro* (SCG, 2004–2006) consisted of Serbia and Montenegro, until 2006 when Montenegro seceded from the Union. This team competed as *Yugoslavia* (YUG) from 1996–2002 and then changed to *Serbia and Montenegro* (2004–2006). After 96 years Serbia returned to the Olympics as an independent team at the 2008 Games. Montenegro first participated as an independent team in 2008.\n* **YAR** , **YMD** → **YEM** Prior to Yemeni unification in 1990, *North Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Arab Republic* (YAR) in 1984 and 1988, and *South Yemen* participated as the *Yemen Democratic Republic* (YMD) at the 1988 Games. After forming united republic Yemen (YEM) has participated since 1992.\n* **ROC** → **CHN** , **TPE** The *Republic of China* was designated as *China* at the 1932, 1936, and 1948 Games and was representing all of China (including Taiwan). After the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China (CHN) and Chinese Taipei (TPE) have participated as separate teams.\n* **ZZX** Special code used by the IOC to refer to medals won by athletes of multiple nations competing together, which was common in early Games (1896–1904). These medals are not included in the respective totals for each nation represented by individual mixed team athletes.\n* **IOP** , **IOA** , **OAR** , **ROC** Special codes used by the IOC for athletes whose NOC is not recognized by IOC. At the 1992 Summer Olympics fifty eight athletes from former Yugoslavia competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2000 Summer Olympics four athletes from East Timor competed as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2012 Summer Olympics three athletes from former Netherlands Antilles and one athlete from South Sudan competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2014 Winter Olympics three athletes from India competed as *Independent Olympic Participants* (IOP). At the 2016 Summer Olympics nine athletes from Kuwait competed as *Independent Olympic Athletes* (IOA). At the 2018 Winter Olympics 168 athletes from Russia competed as *Olympics Athletes from Russia* (OAR). Since the 2020 Summer Olympics athletes from Russia are competing as *Russian Olympic Committee* (ROC).\n\n\n |\n\n### Name changes notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **BIZ** Belize participated under its former name of *British Honduras* (HBR) in 1968 and 1972.\n* **BEN** Benin was known as *Dahomey* (DAH) in 1972.\n* **BUR** Burkina Faso was known as *Upper Volta* (VOL) in 1972.\n* **TPE2** After the Chinese Civil War, Chinese Taipei (TPE) participated using the name of the *Republic of China* at the 1956, 1960, 1972 and 1976 (winter) Games and using *Taiwan* designation at the 1964 and 1968 Games. In 1979, the IOC started to use *Chinese Taipei* to refer to the NOC, a compromise that was acceptable for the People's Republic of China (CHN) that led to the start of its participation in the Olympic Games. The name Chinese Taipei was first used in 1984. Participation of the *Republic of China*, representing all of China (including Taiwan), in 1932, 1936 and 1948 Games are not counted in Taiwan's total participation count.\n* **COD** The Democratic Republic of the Congo was known as *Zaire* (ZAI) between 1984 and 1996.\n* **CIV** Côte d'Ivoire was known as *Ivory Coast* between 1964 and 1988.\n* **EGY** Egypt participated as the *United Arab Republic* (UAR) between 1960 and 1968.\n* **GBR** Includes medals won by athletes from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1896–1920) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1924–present), both of which used the name \"Great Britain\" and the country code GBR.\n | * **GHA** Prior to Ghana's independence in 1957, *Gold Coast* participated in the 1952 Games.\n* **GUY** Prior to Guyana's independence in 1966, *British Guiana* participated from 1948 to 1964.\n* **HKG** Totals of Hong Kong (HKG) includes all medals won by athletes representing the Hong Kong National Olympic Committee, designated as \"Hong Kong\" from 1952–1996 and \"Hong Kong, China\" since 2000.\n* **MKD** North Macedonia was known as *Macedonia*, or more formally *the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia* due to a naming dispute with Greece, between 1996 and 2018.\n* **MYA** Myanmar was known as *Burma* (BIR) between 1948 and 1988.\n* **SAM** Samoa was known as *Western Samoa* between 1984 and 1996.\n* **SRI** Sri Lanka was known as *Ceylon* (CEY) between 1948 and 1972.\n* **SWZ** Eswatini was known as *Swaziland* between 1972 and 2016.\n* **TAN** Although Tanganyika and Zanzibar had already merged to form Tanzania in April 1964, the nation was designated *Tanganyika* in the official report of the 1964 Games.\n* **ZAM** Zambia achieved independence on the last day of the 1964 Games, but had participated as *Northern Rhodesia* (NRH) during those Games.\n* **ZIM** Prior to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, *Southern Rhodesia* participated as *Rhodesia* (RHO) in 1928, 1960, and 1964 Games.\n\n\n |\n\n### Participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **A** Brunei's participation in the 1988 Games consisted only of a single official, but no competing athletes. This participation is not counted in Brunei's participation total.\n* **B** Djibouti at the 2004 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but neither athlete competed, so this participation is not counted in Djibouti's participation total.\n* **C** Liberia's athletes withdrew from 1980 Games after marching in the Opening Ceremony and took part in the boycott. This participation is not counted in Liberia's participation total.\n* **D** Libya marched in the opening ceremony of the 1964 Games, but then withdrew from competition. This participation is not counted in Libya's participation total.\n* **E** Suriname at the 1960 Games took part in the Opening Ceremony, but its lone athlete withdrew from Games due to a scheduling error. Participation of Suriname at the 1960 Games not recognized by IOC, so this participation is not counted in Suriname's participation total.\n | * **F** India's athletes originally competed at the 2014 Games as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic Flag during the opening ceremony due to the Indian Olympic Association's suspension. On February 11, 2014, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.\n* **Ia** **Ib** Does not include the participation of East Timor's and Netherlands Antilles's athletes as *Individual Olympic Athletes* (IOA) at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics.\n* **Za** **Zb** **Zc** **Zd** **Ze** **Zf** **Zg** **Zh** **Zi** **Zj** **Zk** **Zl** **Zm** Does not include medals won as part of mixed teams with athletes from other nations (1896–1904).\n\n\n |\n\n### Disputed participation notes[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| * **H** The Bulgarian Olympic Committee claims that Charles Champaud, a Swiss gymnastics teacher living in Sofia, competed for the nation in 1896. Bulgarian participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **I** The Chilean Olympic Committee claims that Luis Subercaseaux Errázuriz, a Chilean diplomat and athlete, competed for the nation in 1896. Chilean participation at the 1896 Games is recognized by the IOC.\n* **J** Some sources consider Léon Thiércelin, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Haitian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Haiti. Participation of Haiti at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Haiti's participation total.\n* **K** Some sources consider Freydoun Malkom, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Persian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Iran. Participation of Iran at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Iran's participation total.\n* **L** Some sources consider Carlos de Candamo, a fencer who competed at the 1900 Games, of Peruvian nationality and therefore the first Olympic appearance by Peru. Participation of Peru at the 1900 Games is not recognized by the IOC, so this participation is not counted in Peru's participation total.\n* **M** Enrico Brusoni's gold medal in the Cycling Men's Points Race at the 1900 Summer Olympics[36] is recognized by the Italian National Olympic Committee as well as the IOC[37] as being won in a 1900 Summer Olympics event, although some sources state it was unofficial.[38]\n* **N** Monaco earned a bronze in the art competitions at the 1924 Summer Olympics.[39] However, medals in art competitions are no longer recognized by the IOC.[40]\n* **Oa** **Ob** Michel Théato, a French athlete who won the gold medal in marathon at the 1900 Games, was born in Luxembourg.[4] The IOC does not recognize Luxembourg participation at the 1900 Games and attributes his medal to France.\n | The nationalities of many medalists at the 1904 Olympics are disputed as many competitors were recent immigrants to the United States who had not yet been granted US citizenship.\n* **Pa** **Pb** Sources are inconsistent regarding Albert Corey's participation in 1904, who immigrated to the United States from France. The Games report refers to Corey as a \"Frenchman wearing the colors of the Chicago Athletic Association\", but the IOC attributes his medal in the marathon to the United States, and in contradiction, the medal in the four mile team race (that was won by a team of three Americans and Corey) to a mixed team composed of athletes from multiple nations instead of just the United States.[41]\n* **Qa** **Qb** The International Olympic Committee considers Norwegian-American wrestlers Charles Ericksen and Bernhoff Hansen who immigrated from Norway to the United States to have competed for the United States. Each man won a gold medal.[42] In 2012, Norwegian historians however found documentation showing that Ericksen did not receive American citizenship until March 22, 1905, and that Hansen, who was registered as an \"alien\" (foreigner) as late as 1925, probably never received American citizenship. The historians have therefore petitioned the IOC to have the athletes registered as Norwegians.[43][44] In May 2013 it was reported that the Norwegian Olympic Committee had filed a formal application for changing the nationality of the wrestlers in the IOC's medal database.[45]\n* **R** Bob Fowler, an American marathon runner who competed at the 1904 Games, was a native Newfoundlander, Newfoundland is occasionally listed as a separate country at the 1904 Olympics, and would be listed as an historical NOC without medals.[46] Participation of Newfoundland at the 1904 Games is not recognized by the IOC.\n* **S** In 2009, historians from the International Society of Olympic Historians discovered that cyclist Frank Bizzoni was an Italian citizen when he competed in 1904 being granted US citizenship in 1917.[47][48] However, the IOC does not officially recognize Italy's participation in the 1904 Olympics.\n* **Fm** The IOC counts one gold, one silver, and two bronze medals won by American fencer Albertson Van Zo Post for Cuba instead of the United States. The one silver and one bronze medal won by American Charles Tatham are also counted for Cuba instead of the United States.\n\n\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* All-time Paralympic Games medal table\n* All-time Youth Olympic Games medal table\n* Olympic medal table\n* List of first Olympic gold medalists by country\n* List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\n* List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists at a single Games\n* List of multiple Olympic medalists in one event\n* List of Olympic teams by medals won\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Olympic Games - Sochi 2014 | Winter Summer Past and Future Olympics\".

Washington, D.C. was named for George Washington, a Founding Father, victorious commanding general of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States who is widely considered the \"Father of his country\".[11][12] The district is named for Columbia, the female personification of the nation.\n\n\nWashington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the Northeast megalopolis, one of the nation's largest and most influential cultural, political, and economic regions that also includes some of the nation's largest and most prominent cities, including Baltimore, Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. As the seat of the U.S. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital.[13] The city had 20.7 million domestic visitors[14] and 1.2 million international visitors, ranking 7th in the U.S., in 2022.[15]\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. As such, Washington, D.C. is not part of any state, nor is it one itself. The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and Congress held its first session there in 1800. In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria, was officially recognized as the federal district; the city initially comprised only a portion of its modern territory, as a distinct entity within the larger federal district.[16] In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district, though locally elected government lasted only three years and did not return for over a century.[17] There have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s; a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the U.S. Senate.[18]\n\n\nDesigned in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the city is divided into quadrants, which are centered around the Capitol and include 131 neighborhoods. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545,[3] making it the 23rd-most populous city in the U.S., third-most populous city in the Southeast after Jacksonville and Charlotte, and third-most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic after New York City and Philadelphia.[19] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[20] The Washington metropolitan area, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, is the country's sixth-largest metropolitan area with a 2020 population of 6.3 million residents.[21]\n\n\nThe city hosts all three branches of the U.S. federal government, Congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the Supreme Court (judicial), and the governmental buildings that house most of the federal government, including the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court Building, and multiple federal departments and agencies. The city is home to many national monuments and museums, located primarily on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, and other international organizations. Many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks are based in the city, including AARP, American Red Cross, Atlantic Council, Brookings Institution, National Geographic Society, The Heritage Foundation, Wilson Center, and others.\n\n\nA locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though Congress is empowered to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C. residents are, on a federal level, politically disenfranchised since the city's residents do not have voting representation in Congress, although the city's residents elect a single at-large congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives who has no voting authority. The city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Washington, D.C.\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Washington, D.C.\n\nVarious tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people, also known as the Conoy, inhabited the lands around the Potomac River and present-day Washington, D.C. when Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. The Nacotchtank, also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries, maintained settlements around the Anacostia River in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes ultimately forced the Piscataway people to relocate, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland.[22]\n\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Built in 1765, Old Stone House in Georgetown is the city's oldest still standing building.\n![](image)James Hoban's 1793 plans for what today is the White House\n![](image)In 1800, following relocation of the nation's capital from Philadelphia, the U.S. Congress began assembling in the newly constructed United States Capitol.\nPrior to the establishment of the city as the nation's capital in 1800, the nation's capital was Philadelphia, which served as the capital on five separate occasions during the American Revolution and its aftermath from May 1775 to July 1776, December 1776 to February 1777, March 1777 to September 1777, July 1778, July 1778 to March 1781, and March 1781 to June 1783. The Continental Congress was briefly based in five additional locations: York, Pennsylvania in September 1777, Princeton, New Jersey in 1783, Annapolis, Maryland from November 1783 to August 1784, Trenton, New Jersey from November to December 1784, and New York City from January 1785 to March 1789.\n\n\nOn October 6, 1783, after the capital was forced by the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey, Congress resolved to consider a new location for it.[23] The following day, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts moved \"that buildings for the use of Congress be erected on the banks of the Delaware near Trenton, or of the Potomac, near Georgetown, provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid, for a federal town\".[24]\n\n\nIn Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.[25] The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.[26]\n\n\nArticle One, Section Eight of the U.S. Constitution permits the establishment of a \"District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States\".[27] However, the constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In the Compromise of 1790, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States.[28][a]\n\n\nOn July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. Under the Residence Act, the exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16, 1790. Formed from land donated by Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side and totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).[29][b]\n\n\nTwo pre existing settlements were included in the territory, the port of Georgetown, founded in 1751,[30] and the port city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749.[31] In 1791 and 1792, a team led by Andrew Ellicott, including Ellicott's brothers Joseph and Benjamin and African American astronomer Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point; many of these stones are still standing.[32][33]\n\n\nA new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac River, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The same day, the federal district was named Columbia, a feminine form of Columbus, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly used at that time.[34][35] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.[36][37]\n\n\nCongress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. The area within the district was organized into two counties, the County of Washington to the east and north of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west and south.[38] After the Act's passage, citizens in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which ended their representation in Congress.[39]\n\n\n\n### Burning during War of 1812[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Burning of Washington\n\n![](image)The August 24, 1814, burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812, depicted in an 1816 portrait\n![](image)*City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard*, an 1833 portrait of Washington, D.C. by George Cooke featuring the Anacostia River (foreground), the Potomac River (left), and Capitol Hill (center-right)\nOn August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812, British forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an American force at Bladensburg. In retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in the Canadas, the British set fire to multiple government buildings in the city, including the United States Capitol, the Treasury Building and the White House. All the buildings set on fire were gutted in what became known as the burning of Washington. However, a storm forced the British to evacuate the city after just 24 hours.[40] Most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.[41]\n\n\n\n### Retrocession and the Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: District of Columbia retrocession and Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)The U.S. Capitol dome was under construction during Lincoln's first inauguration on March 4, 1861; five weeks later, the American Civil War was launched following the Confederate bombardment and fall of Fort Sumter on April 13, 1861.\nIn the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria declined economically due in part to neglect of it by Congress.[42] Alexandria was a major market in the domestic slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district, further depressing the local economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession.[43]\n\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846, to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress went further, agreeing to return all territory that Virginia had ceded to the district during its formation. This left the district's area consisting only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.[42] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.[44]\n\n\nThe outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the city's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.[45] President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district, freeing about 3,100 slaves in the district nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.[46] In 1868, Congress granted the district's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.[45]\n\n\n\n### Growth and redevelopment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: City Beautiful movement\n\n![](image)The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, built between 1871 and 1888, was the world's largest office building from its opening until 1943, when it was surpassed by The Pentagon.\nBy 1870, the district's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents.[47] Despite the city's growth, however, Washington still had dirt roads and the city lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider the proposal.[48]\n\n\nCongress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, abolished Washington County, and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia[49] and making \"the city of Washington...legally indistinguishable from the District of Columbia.\"[16]\n\n\nAfter the reorganization, in 1873, President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd as Governor of the District of Columbia. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized the city but ultimately bankrupted the district government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.[50]\n\n\nIn 1888, the city's first motorized streetcars began service. Their introduction generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries, leading to an expansion of the district over the next few decades.[51] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged to those of the City of Washington in 1895.[52] However, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works, leading it to become the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the City Beautiful movement in the early 20th century.[53]\n\n\nThe City Beautiful movement built heavily upon the already-implemented L'Enfant Plan, with the new McMillan Plan leading urban development in the city throughout the movement. Much of the old Victorian Mall was replaced with modern Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts architecture; these designs are still prevalent in the city's governmental buildings today.\n\n\nIncreased federal spending as a result of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district,[54] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations Ross A. Collins from Mississippi justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents, saying that \"my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers.\"[55]\n\n\nWorld War II led to an expansion of federal employees in the city;[56] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.[47]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights and home rule era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1968 Washington, D.C., riots and District of Columbia home rule\n\n![](image)The March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on August 28, 1963\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still not affording the city's residents representation in Congress.[57]\n\n\nAfter the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, riots broke out in the city, primarily in the U Street, 14th Street, 7th Street, and H Street corridors, which were predominantly black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and Washington, D.C. Army National Guardsmen stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned, and rebuilding from the riots was not completed until the late 1990s.[58]\n\n\nIn 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district.[59] In 1975, Walter Washington became the district's first elected and first black mayor.[60]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the D.C. statehood movement has grown in prominence. In 2016, a referendum on D.C. statehood resulted in an 85% support among Washington, D.C. voters for it to become the nation's 51st state. In March 2017, the city's congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill for statehood. Reintroduced in 2019 and 2021 as the Washington, D.C., Admission Act, the U.S. House of Representatives passed it in April 2021. After not progressing in the Senate, the statehood bill was introduced again in January 2023.[61]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Washington Monument viewed from the Tidal Basin during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in April 2018\nWashington, D.C., is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. East Coast. The city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water.[62] The district is bordered by Montgomery County, Maryland, to the northwest; Prince George's County, Maryland, to the east; Arlington County, Virginia, to the west; and Alexandria, Virginia, to the south. Washington is 38 miles (61 km) from Baltimore, 124 miles (200 km) from Philadelphia, 227 miles (365 km) from New York City, 242 miles (389 km) from Pittsburgh, 384 miles (618 km) from Charlotte, and 439 miles (707 km) from Boston.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe south bank of the Potomac River forms the district's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries, the Anacostia River and Rock Creek.[63] Tiber Creek, a natural watercourse that once passed through the National Mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.[64] The creek also formed a portion of the now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s.[65] The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of the city at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.[66]\n\n\nThe highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125 m) above sea level at Fort Reno Park in upper northwest Washington, D.C.[67] The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River.[68] The geographic center of Washington is near the intersection of 4th and L Streets NW.[69][70][71]\n\n\nThe district has 7,464 acres (30.21 km2) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density U.S. cities after Philadelphia.[72] The city's sizable parkland was a factor in the city being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the park systems of the nation's 100 most populous cities, according to Trust for Public Land, a non-profit organization.[73]\n\n\nThe National Park Service manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92 km2) of city land owned by the U.S. government.[74] Rock Creek Park is a 1,754-acre (7.10 km2) urban forest in Northwest Washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0 km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. Established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes.[75] Other National Park Service properties include the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, the National Mall and Memorial Parks, Theodore Roosevelt Island, Columbia Island, Fort Dupont Park, Meridian Hill Park, Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, and Anacostia Park.[76] The District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6 km2) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers.[77] The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates the 446-acre (1.80 km2) United States National Arboretum in Northeast Washington, D.C.[78]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate change in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Key Bridge (background) and an iced-over Potomac River (foreground) in February 2004\nWashington's climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: *Cfa*), or oceanic (Trewartha: *Do* bordering *Cf* downtown).[79][80] Winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.[81][82]\n\n\nSummers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8 °F (26.6 °C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100 °F (38 °C) at the height of summer.[83] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.[84]\n\n\nBlizzards affect Washington once every four to six years on average. The most violent storms, known as nor'easters, often impact large regions of the East Coast.[85] From January 27 to 28, 1922, the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.[86] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.[87]\n\n\nHurricanes or their remnants occasionally impact the area in late summer and early fall. However, they usually are weak by the time they reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location.[88] Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the Georgetown neighborhood of the city.[89] Precipitation occurs throughout the year.[90]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 6, 1918, and on July 20, 1930.[91] The lowest recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) on February 11, 1899, right before the Great Blizzard of 1899.[85] During a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90 °F (32 °C) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32 °F or 0 °C).[92] On average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is November 18 and the last day is March 27.[93][94]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Washington, D.C.

In 1791, President George Washington commissioned Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital, and enlisted Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan.[99] The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.[100] L'Enfant based his design on plans of other major world cities, including Paris, Amsterdam, Karlsruhe, and Milan that Thomas Jefferson had sent to him.[101]: 22 L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) in length and 400 feet (120 m) wide in area that is now the National Mall.[102] In March 1792, however, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. Andrew Ellicott, who worked with L'Enfant in surveying the city, was then tasked with completing its design. Though Ellicott revised the original L'Enfant plans, including changing some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the city's overall design.[103]\n\n\nBy the early 20th century, however, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital was marred by slums and randomly placed buildings in the city, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.[53] What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included relandscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design for the city.[100]\n\n\nBy law, the city's skyline is low and sprawling. The federal Height of Buildings Act of 1910 prohibits buildings exceeding the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet (6.1 m).[104] Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or the 555-foot (169 m) Washington Monument,[71] which remains the district's tallest structure. City leaders have criticised the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused partly by suburban sprawl.[104] Washington D.C. still has a relatively high homelessness rate, despite its high living standard compared to many American cities.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C. is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol.[105] All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.[105]\n\n* Selection of neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.\n* ![Bloomingdale](image)\n\nBloomingdale\n* ![Capitol Hill](image)\n\nCapitol Hill\n* ![Cathedral Heights](image)\n\nCathedral Heights\n* ![Chinatown](image)\n\nChinatown\n* ![Columbia Heights](image)\n\nColumbia Heights\n* ![Dupont Circle](image)\n\nDupont Circle\n* ![Edgewood](image)\n\nEdgewood\n* ![Georgetown](image)\n\nGeorgetown\n* ![Logan Circle](image)\n\nLogan Circle\n* ![Navy Yard](image)\n\nNavy Yard\n\n\nThe City of Washington was bordered by Boundary Street to the north, later renamed Florida Avenue in 1890, Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east.[51][100] Washington, D.C.'s street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888.[106] Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.[52] Some streets are particularly noteworthy, including Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House to the Capitol, and K Street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.[107] Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, located on the north and south sides of the National Mall, respectively, are home to many of Washington's iconic museums, including the Smithsonian Institution buildings and the National Archives Building. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, many of which are on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.[108]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Lincoln Memorial (foreground), Washington Monument (center), and U.S. Capitol (background) are each built in the Neoclassical motif.\n![](image)The Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront along the Potomac River\n![](image)Victorian houses in Dupont Circle\nThe architecture of Washington, D.C., varies greatly and is generally popular among tourists and locals. In 2007, six of the top ten buildings in the American Institute of Architects' ranking of America's Favorite Architecture were in the city:[109] the White House, Washington National Cathedral, the Jefferson Memorial, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The neoclassical, Georgian, Gothic, and Modern styles are reflected among these six structures and many other prominent edifices in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany of the government buildings, monuments, and museums along the National Mall and surrounding areas are heavily inspired by classical Roman and Greek architecture. The designs of the White House, the U.S. Capitol, Supreme Court Building, Washington Monument, National Gallery of Art, Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial are all heavily drawn from these classical architectural movements and feature large pediments, domes, columns in classical order, and heavy stone walls. Notable exceptions to the city's classical-style architecture include buildings constructed in the French Second Empire style, including the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.[110] The Thomas Jefferson Building, the main Library of Congress building, and the historic Willard Hotel are built in Beaux-Arts style, popular throughout the world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [111][112] Meridian Hill Park contains a cascading waterfall with Italian renaissance-style architecture.[113]\n\n\nModern, Postmodern, contemporary, and other non-classical architectural styles are also seen in the city's buildings. The National Museum of African American History and Culture deeply contrasts the stone-based neoclassical buildings on the National Mall with a design that combines modern engineering with heavy inspiration from African art.[114] The interior of the Washington Metro stations and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden are designed with strong influence from the 20th-century Brutalism movement.[115] The Smithsonian Institution Building is built of Seneca red sandstone in the Norman Revival style.[116] The Old Post Office building, located on Pennsylvania Avenue and completed in 1899, was the first building in the city to have a steel frame structure and the first to utilize electrical wiring in its design.[117]\n\n\nNotable contemporary residential buildings, restaurants, shops, and office buildings in the city include the Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront, Navy Yard along the Anacostia River, and CityCenterDC in Downtown. The Wharf, given its proximity to the Potomac River, has seen the construction of several high-rise office and residential buildings overlooking the river. Additionally, restaurants, bars, and shops have been opened at street level. Many of these buildings have a modern glass exterior and heavy curvature.[118][119] CityCenterDC is home to Palmer Alley, a pedestrian-only walkway, and houses several apartment buildings, restaurants, and luxury-brand storefronts with streamlined glass and metal facades.[120]\n\n\nOutside Downtown D.C., architectural styles are more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, Châteauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian Revival, Beaux-Arts, and a variety of Victorian styles.[121] Rowhouses are prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federal and late Victorian designs.[122] Georgetown's Old Stone House, built in 1765, is the oldest-standing building in the city.[123] Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture.[110] The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the district with a total area of approximately 3.1 million square feet (288,000 m2).[124] Washington Union Station is designed from a combination of different architectural styles. Its Great Hall, which serves as the main hall within the building, has elaborate gold leaf designs along the ceilings and the hall includes several decorative classical-style statues.[125]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 8,144 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 15,471 |  | 90.0% |\n| 1820 | 23,336 |  | 50.8% |\n| 1830 | 30,261 |  | 29.7% |\n| 1840 | 33,745 |  | 11.5% |\n| 1850 | 51,687 |  | 53.2% |\n| 1860 | 75,080 |  | 45.3% |\n| 1870 | 131,700 |  | 75.4% |\n| 1880 | 177,624 |  | 34.9% |\n| 1890 | 230,392 |  | 29.7% |\n| 1900 | 278,718 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1910 | 331,069 |  | 18.8% |\n| 1920 | 437,571 |  | 32.2% |\n| 1930 | 486,869 |  | 11.3% |\n| 1940 | 663,091 |  | 36.2% |\n| 1950 | 802,178 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1960 | 763,956 |  | −4.8% |\n| 1970 | 756,510 |  | −1.0% |\n| 1980 | 638,333 |  | −15.6% |\n| 1990 | 606,900 |  | −4.9% |\n| 2000 | 572,059 |  | −5.7% |\n| 2010 | 601,723 |  | 5.2% |\n| 2020 | 689,545 |  | 14.6% |\n| Source:[126] [e][47][127] Note:[f]2010–2020[3] |\n\n\n\n\n| Demographic profile\n | 2020[129] | 2010[130] | 1990[131] | 1970[131] | 1940[131] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 39.6% | 38.5% | 29.6% | 27.7% | 71.5%\n |\n|  —Non-Hispanic whites | 38.0% | 34.8% | 27.4% | 26.5%[g] | 71.4%\n |\n| Black or African American | 41.4% | 50.7% | 65.8% | 71.1% | 28.2%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race)\n | 11.3% | 9.1% | 5.4% | 2.1%[g] | 0.1%\n |\n| Asian | 4.8% | 3.5% | 1.8% | 0.6% | 0.2%\n |\n\n\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in the Washington metropolitan area, according to the 2010 U.S. census. Each dot represents 25 people: **White**, **Black**, **Asian**, **Hispanic** or **Other** (yellow)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the district's population was 705,749 as of July 2019, an increase of more than 100,000 people compared to the 2010 United States Census. When measured on a decade-over-decade basis, this continues a growth trend since 2000, following a half-century of population decline.[132] But on a year-over-year basis, the July 2019 census count shows a population decline of 16,000 individuals over the preceding 12-month period.[133][*unreliable source?*] Washington was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010[update].[134] According to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over a million.[135] If the district were a state it would rank 49th in population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming.[136]\n\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area, which includes the district and surrounding suburbs, is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. with an estimated six million residents as of 2016.[137] When the Washington area is included with Baltimore and its suburbs, it forms the vast Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area. With a population exceeding 9.8 million residents in 2020, it is the third-largest combined statistical area in the country.[138]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 4,410 homeless people in Washington, D.C.[139][140]\n\n\nAccording to 2017 Census Bureau data, the population of Washington, D.C. was 47.1% Black or African American, 45.1% White (36.8% non-Hispanic White), 4.3% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Individuals from two or more races made up 2.7% of the population. Hispanics of any race made up 11.0% of the district's population.[136]\n\n\nWashington, D.C. has had a significant African American population since the city's foundation.[141] African American residents composed about 30% of the district's total population between 1800 and 1940.[47] The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. Partly as a result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.[142] According to a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, D.C. has experienced more \"intense\" gentrification than any other American city, with 40% of neighborhoods gentrified.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 17% of Washington, D.C. residents were age 18 or younger as of 2010, lower than the U.S. average of 24%. However, at 34 years old, the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states as of 2010.[144] As of 2010[update], there were an estimated 81,734 immigrants living in Washington, D.C.[145] Major sources of immigration include El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mexico, Guatemala, and China, with a concentration of Salvadorans in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood.[146]\n\n\nAs of 2010, there were 4,822 same-sex couples in the city, about 2% of total households, according to Williams Institute.[147] Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009, and the district began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.[148]\n\n\n\nReligious buildings in Washington, D.C.\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSeveral major religious buildings in Washington, D.C.

Seward, who was stabbed by an intruder in his Lafayette Square house on the evening of President Lincoln's assassination.[255] Located next to the square and on Pennsylvania Avenue across from the White House is the Blair House, which serves as the primary state guest house for the U.S. president.[256]\n\n\nThere are several river islands in Washington, D.C., including Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River, which has trails and is home to the Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial.[257] Columbia Island, also in the Potomac, is home to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove, the Navy – Merchant Marine Memorial, and a marina. Kingman Island, in the Anacostia River, is home to Langston Golf Course and a public park with trails.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther parks, gardens, and squares include Dumbarton Oaks, Meridian Hill Park, the Yards, Anacostia Park, Lincoln Park, Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, Franklin Square, McPherson Square, Farragut Square, and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park.[258] There are a large number of traffic circles and circle parks in Washington, D.C., including Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Scott Circle, Sheridan Circle, Thomas Circle, Washington Circle, and others.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe United States National Arboretum is a dense arboretum in Northeast D.C. filled with gardens and trails. Its most notable landmark is the National Capitol Columns monument.[259]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n| Team\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Neighborhood\n | Capacity\n | Founded (moved to Washington area)\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Washington Commanders | NFL | American football\n | FedExField | Landover, Maryland | 67,617\n | 1932 (1937)\n | 1937, 1942, 1982, 1987, 1991\n |\n| Washington Wizards | NBA | Men's Basketball\n | Capital One Arena | Chinatown | 20,356\n | 1961 (1973)\n | 1978\n |\n| Washington Nationals | MLB | Baseball\n | Nationals Park | Navy Yard | 41,339\n | 1969 (2005)\n | 2019\n |\n| Washington Capitals | NHL | Ice hockey\n | Capital One Arena | Chinatown | 18,573\n | 1974\n | 2018\n |\n| D.C.

The Washington Commanders of the National Football League play at FedExField in nearby Landover, Maryland. The Washington Wizards of the National Basketball Association and the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League play at Capital One Arena in the city's Penn Quarter neighborhood. The Washington Mystics of the Women's National Basketball Association play at Entertainment and Sports Arena. D.C. United of Major League Soccer plays at Audi Field.\n\n\nThe city's teams have won a combined 13 professional league championships over their respective histories. The Washington Commanders (named the Washington Redskins until 2020), have won two NFL Championships and three Super Bowls;[263] D.C. United has won four;[264] and the Washington Wizards, then named the Washington Bullets, Washington Capitals, Washington Mystics, and Washington Nationals have each won a single championship.[265][266]\n\n\nOther professional and semi-professional teams in Washington, D.C. include DC Defenders of the XFL, Old Glory DC of Major League Rugby, the Washington Kastles of World TeamTennis, and the D.C. Divas of the Independent Women's Football League. The William H.G. FitzGerald Tennis Center in Rock Creek Park hosts the Washington Open, a joint men's ATP Tour 500- and women's WTA Tour 500-level tennis tournament, every summer in late July and early August. Washington, D.C. has two major annual marathon races, the Marine Corps Marathon, held every autumn, and the Rock 'n' Roll USA Marathon, held each spring. The Marine Corps Marathon began in 1976 and is sometimes called \"The People's Marathon\" because it is the largest marathon that does not offer prize money to participants.[267]\n\n\nThe district's four NCAA Division I teams are the American Eagles of American University, George Washington Revolutionaries of George Washington University, the Georgetown Hoyas of Georgetown University, and the Howard Bison and Lady Bison of Howard University. The Georgetown men's basketball team is the most notable and also plays at Capital One Arena. Washington, D.C. area's regional sports television network is Monumental Sports Network, and was known as *NBC Sports Washington* until September 2023.[268]\n\n\n\n## City government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of the District of Columbia\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elections in the District of Columbia\n\nSee also: District of Columbia home rule and List of District of Columbia symbols\n\n![](image)The John A. Wilson Building is the headquarters for much of the Government of the District of Columbia, including the offices of the mayor and D.C. Council.\nArticle One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the city. The district did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.[269] Washington, D.C., is overwhelmingly Democratic, having voted for the Democratic presidential candidate solidly since it was granted electoral votes in 1964.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEach of the city's eight wards elects a single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the district as a whole. The council chair is also elected at-large.[270] There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration.[271] The attorney general of the District of Columbia is elected to a four-year term.[272]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., observes all federal holidays and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the district.[46] The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family coat of arms.[273]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2015.[274]\n\n\nThe idiom \"Inside the Beltway\" is a reference used by media to describe discussions of national political issues inside of Washington, by way of geographical demarcation regarding the region within the Capital's Beltway, Interstate 495, the city's highway loop (beltway) constructed in 1964. The phrase is used as a title for a number of political columns and news items by publications like *The Washington Times*.[275]\n\n\n\n### Budgetary issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judiciary Square, home to many city and federal government agencies and institutions, including the DC Superior Court, the DC Court of Appeals, the Metropolitan Police Department, Washington Metro, and One Judiciary Square\nThe mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470 million and over $1 billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.[276][277]\n\n\nThe city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, has been criticized for mismanagement and waste.[278] During his administration in 1989, *Washington Monthly* magazine labeled the district \"the worst city government in America\".[279] In 1995, at the start of Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending.[280] Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe district regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.[281]\n\n\nThe district has a federally funded \"Emergency Planning and Security Fund\" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. During the Trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. Trump's January 2017 inauguration cost the city $27 million; of that, $7 million was never repaid to the fund. Trump's 2019 Independence Day event, \"A Salute to America\", cost six times more than Independence Day events in past years.[282]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights debate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District of Columbia voting rights and Political party strength in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The city's license plate calls for an end to taxation without representation.\nWashington, D.C. is not a state and therefore has no federal voting representation in Congress. The city's residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives (D.C. at-large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The district has no official representation in the United States Senate. Neither chamber seats the district's elected \"shadow\" representative or senators. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all federal taxes.[283] In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7 billion in federal taxes, more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.[284]\n\n\nA 2005 poll found that 78% of Americans did not know residents of Washington, D.C., have less representation in Congress than residents of the 50 states.[285] Efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, \"End Taxation Without Representation\", on D.C. vehicle license plates.[286] There is evidence of nationwide approval for D.C. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of Americans believe D.C. should have voting representation in Congress.[285][287]\n\n\nOpponents to federal voting rights for Washington, D.C., propose that the Founding Fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making District of Columbia a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.[288]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThe city passed a law that requires shelter to be provided to everyone in need when the temperature drops below freezing.[289] Since D.C. does not have enough shelter units available, every winter it books hotel rooms in the suburbs with an average cost around $100 for a night. According to the D.C. Department of Human Services, during the winter of 2012 the city spent $2,544,454 on putting homeless families in hotels,[290] and budgeted $3.2 million on hotel beds in 2013.[291]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District of Columbia Public Schools and List of parochial and private schools in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a public magnet school in the city\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), the sole public school district in the city,[292] operates the city's 123 public schools.[293] The number of students in DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009. In the 2010–11 school year, 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system.[294] DCPS has one of the highest-cost, yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, in terms of both infrastructure and student achievement.[295] Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development.[296]\n\n\nThe District of Columbia Public Charter School Board monitors the 52 public charter schools in the city.[297] Due to the perceived problems with the traditional public school system, enrollment in public charter schools had by 2007 steadily increased.[298] As of 2010, D.C., charter schools had a total enrollment of about 32,000, a 9% increase from the prior year.[294] The district is also home to 92 private schools, which enrolled approximately 18,000 students in 2008.[299]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Georgetown University, founded in 1789, is the city's oldest university.\nThe University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public land-grant university providing undergraduate and graduate education.[*citation needed*] Federally chartered universities include American University (AU), Gallaudet University, George Washington University (GWU), Georgetown University (GU), and Howard University (HU). Other private universities include the Catholic University of America (CUA), the Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), and Trinity Washington University. The Corcoran College of Art and Design, the oldest art school in the capital, was absorbed into the George Washington University in 2014, now serving as its college of arts.[300]\n\n\nThe city's medical research institutions include Washington Hospital Center and Children's National Medical Center. The city is home to three medical schools and associated teaching hospitals: George Washington, Georgetown, and Howard universities.[301]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has dozens of public and private libraries and library systems, including the District of Columbia Public Library system.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Library of Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Library of Congress\n\n![](image)The Library of Congress, the world's largest library with more than 167 million cataloged items and the nation's oldest cultural institution[302]\nThe Library of Congress is the research library that officially serves the United States Congress and is the *de facto* national library of the United States. It is a complex of three buildings: Thomas Jefferson Building, John Adams Building and James Madison Memorial Building, all located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.

It houses the world's largest collection of material related to William Shakespeare[304] and third-largest collection of English books printed before 1641.[305][306] The Folger Library also runs special events and cultural attractions, most notably the Folger Theatre, which is known for being a leading interpreter of Shakespeare's works, in addition to those from other authors.[307]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of newspapers in Washington, D.C.; List of films set in Washington, D.C.; and List of television shows set in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)One Franklin Square, located on Franklin Square in Downtown Washington, D.C., includes the headquarters of *The Washington Post*.\n![](image)The National Press Club houses many Washington, D.C.-based news bureaus.\nWashington, D.C., is a prominent center for national and international media. *The Washington Post*, founded in 1877, is the city's oldest and most-read local daily newspaper.[308] \"*The Post*\", as it is popularly called, is well known as the newspaper that exposed the Watergate scandal.[309] It had the sixth-highest readership of all news dailies in the country in 2011.[310] *The Washington Post* also publishes a Spanish language newspaper *El Tiempo Latino*, a leading Spanish-language news source for the Washington area. *The Post* is headquartered at One Franklin Square just north of Franklin Square in Downtown Washington.\n\n\n*The Washington Times* is a general interest daily newspaper and popular among conservatives.[311] The alternative weekly *Washington City Paper*, with a circulation of 47,000, is also based in the city and has a substantial readership in the Washington area.[312][313]\n\n\n*The Atlantic* magazine, which has covered politics, international affairs, and cultural issues since 1857, is headquartered at the Watergate complex in Washington.[314]\n\n\nSeveral community and specialty papers focus on neighborhood and cultural issues, including the weekly *Washington Blade* and *Metro Weekly*, which focus on LGBT issues; the *Washington Informer* and *The Washington Afro American*, which highlight topics of interest to the black community; and neighborhood newspapers published by The Current Newspapers. *Congressional Quarterly*, *The Hill*, *Politico*, and *Roll Call* newspapers focus exclusively on issues related to Congress and the federal government. Other publications based in Washington include the *National Geographic* magazine and political publications such as *The Washington Examiner*, *The New Republic*, and *Washington Monthly*.[315] *USA Today*, which is the largest newspaper in the country as measured by circulation, as well as its parent company Gannett, which is the largest newspaper publisher in the United States,[316] are both headquartered in nearby Tysons, Virginia.[317][318]\n\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area is the ninth-largest television media market in the nation, with two million homes, representing approximately 2% of the country's television market.[319] Several media companies and cable television channels have their headquarters in the area, including C-SPAN, Radio One, the National Geographic Channel, Smithsonian Networks, National Public Radio (NPR), Travel Channel (in Chevy Chase, Maryland), Discovery Communications (in Silver Spring, Maryland), and PBS (in Arlington County, Virginia). The headquarters of Voice of America, the U.S. government's international news service, is near the Capitol in Southwest Washington, D.C.[320]\n\n\nThe city is served by two local NPR affiliates, WAMU and WETA.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Washington, D.C.\n\n#### Streets and highways[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of circles in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Pennsylvania Avenue, one of the city's most prominent streets\nThere are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district.[321] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built. Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.[322] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city.[323]\n\n\nAccording to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70 hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.[324] However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.[325] An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Cycling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Capital Bikeshare rental station near McPherson Square\nIn May 2022, the city celebrated the expansion of its bike lane network to 104 miles (167 km), a 60 percent increase from 2015. Of those miles, 24 miles (39 km) were protected bike lanes. It also boasted 62 miles (100 km) of bike trails.[327] As of March 2023,[update] the city has 108 miles (174 km) of bike lanes, with 30 miles (48 km) of them protected bike lanes.[328]\n\n\nD.C. is part of the regional Capital Bikeshare program. Started in 2010, it is one of the largest bicycle sharing systems in the country with more than 4,351 bicycles and more than 395 stations,[329] all provided by PBSC Urban Solutions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Walkability[edit]\n\n\nA 2021 study by Walk Score ranked Washington, D.C. the fifth-most walkable city in the country. According to the study, the most walkable neighborhoods are U Street, Dupont Circle, and Mount Vernon Square.[330] In 2013, the Washington Metropolitan Area had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit.[331]\n\n\n\n#### River crossings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of crossings of the Potomac River and List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Memorial Bridge connects the city across the Potomac River with Arlington, Virginia.\nThere are multiple transportation methods to cross the city's two rivers, the Potomac River and the Anacostia River. There are numerous bridges that take cars, trains, pedestrians, and bikers across the rivers. Among these are Arlington Memorial Bridge, the 14th Street Bridges, Francis Scott Key Bridge, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and Frederick Douglass Bridge.[332]\n\n\nThere are also ferries and water cruises that cross the Potomac River. One of these is the Potomac Water Taxi, operated by Hornblower Cruises, which goes between the Georgetown Waterfront, the Wharf, the Old Town Alexandria Waterfront, and National Harbor.[333]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of railroads in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Union Station, the 10th-busiest rail station in the nation\n![](image)Washington Metro, the second-busiest rapid rail system in the U.S. based on average weekday ridership after the New York City Subway\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit rail system. The system serves Washington, D.C. and its Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976, and consists of six lines (each one color coded), 97 stations, and 129 miles (208 km) of track.[334] Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country and fifth-busiest in North America.[335] It operates mostly as a deep-level subway in more densely populated parts of the D.C. metropolitan area (including most of the District itself), while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated. Metro is known for its iconic brutalist-style vaulted ceilings in the interior stations. It is also known for having long escalators in some of its underground stations. The longest single-tier escalator in the Western Hemisphere, spanning 230 feet (70 m), is located at Metro's Wheaton station in Maryland.[336]\n\n\nUnion Station is the city's main train station and serves approximately 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6 million passengers annually and is the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor, which carries long-distance and regional services to New York Penn Station and points in New England. As of 2023, Union Station is the ninth-busiest rail station in the nation and tenth-busiest in North America.\n\n\nMaryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.[337] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.[338]\n\n\nAlthough Washington, D.C. was known throughout the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries for its streetcars, these lines were dismantled in the 1960s. In 2016, however, the city brought back a streetcar line, DC Streetcar, which is a single line system in Northeast Washington, D.C., along H Street and Benning Road, known as the H Street/Benning Road Line.[339]\n\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)\n\n![](image)Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n![](image)DC Circulator, operated by the District Department of Transportation\nTwo main public bus systems operate in Washington, D.C. Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), is the primary public bus system in Washington, D.C. Serving more than 400,000 riders each weekday, it is one of the nation's largest bus systems by annual ridership.[340] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial and touristic areas within central Washington.[341] The DC Circulator costs only $1 to ride and is composed of six distinct routes that cover central D.C. and suburban Rosslyn, Virginia. The DC Circulator is run via a public-private partnerships between the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, WMATA, and DC Surface Transit, Inc. (DCST). The bus system services each stop approximately every 10 minutes.[342]\n\n\nMany other public bus systems operate in the various jurisdictions of the Washington region outside of the city in suburban Maryland and Virginia. Among these are the Fairfax Connector in Fairfax County, Virginia; DASH in Alexandria, Virginia; and TheBus in Prince George's County, Maryland.[343] There are also numerous commuter buses that residents of the wider Washington region take to commute into the city for work or other events. Among these are the Loudoun County Transit Commuter Bus and the Maryland Transit Administration Commuter Bus.[344]\n\n\nThe city also has several bus lines used by tourists and others visiting the city, including Big Bus Tours, Old Town Trolley Tours, and DC Trails. The city also has many charter buses used in carrying young students and other tourists from across the country to the city and region's historic sites. These buses are often found parked beside the city's most notable tourist attractions, including National Mall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aviation in Washington, D.C.; List of airports serving Washington, D.C.; and List of heliports in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia is the closest airport to the city among the three major Washington metropolitan area airports.\nThree major airports serve the district, though none are within the city's borders. Two of these major airports are located in suburban Virginia and one in suburban Maryland. The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is located in Arlington County, Virginia, just across the Potomac River about 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Washington, D.C. This airport provides primarily domestic flights and has the lowest number of passengers of the three airports in the region. The busiest by number of total passengers is Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI), located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of the city.[345] The busiest by international flights and the largest by land size and amount of facilities is Washington Dulles International Airport, located in Dulles, Virginia, about 24 miles (39 km) west of the city.[346] Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Washington-Baltimore region.[347] Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan National Airport is a hub for American Airlines,[348] Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners,[349] and BWI is an operating base for Southwest Airlines.[350] In 2018, the Washington, D.C. area was the 18th-busiest airport system in the world by passenger traffic, accumulating over 74 million passengers between its three main commercial airports.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe President of the United States does not use any of these airports for travel. Instead, he typically travels by Marine One from the White House South Lawn to Joint Base Andrews, located in suburban Maryland. From there, he takes Air Force One to his destination. Joint Base Andrews was built in 1942. From 1942 to 2009, it was solely an Air Force base, but became a joint Air Force and Naval base in 2009, when Andrews Air Force Base and Naval Air Facility Washington were merged into a singular entity with the creation of Joint Base Andrews.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, Pepco, and Washington Gas\n\n![](image)The headquarters of DC Water and Sewer Authority on Canal Street, SW, in 2019\nThe District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, also known as WASA or D.C. Water, is an independent authority of the Washington, D.C., government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in the city. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia, Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.[351] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6 million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties.[352]\n\n\nPepco is the city's electric utility and services 793,000 customers in the district and suburban Maryland.[353] An 1889 law prohibits overhead wires within much of the historic City of Washington. As a result, all power lines and telecommunication cables are located underground in downtown Washington, and traffic signals are placed at the edge of the street.[354] A 2013 plan would bury an additional 60 miles (97 km) of primary power lines throughout the district.[355]\n\n\nWashington Gas is the city's natural gas utility and serves more than a million customers in the district and its suburbs. Incorporated by Congress in 1848, the company installed the city's first gas lights in the Capitol, White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue.[356]\n\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia\n\n![](image)Washington, D.C. police on Harley-Davidson motorcycles escort the March for Life protest on Constitution Avenue in January 2018.\nSome 67,000 residents, about 10% of the population, are ex-convicts.[357]\n\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the number of homicides continued an upward trend with over 200 homicides in both years, a significant rise from previous lows.[358] In 2012, D.C.'s annual murder count had dropped to 88, the lowest total since 1961.[359] The city was once described as the \"murder capital\" of the United States during the early 1990s.[360] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but the level of violence then began to decline significantly.[361]\n\n\nIn 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015.[362] Many neighborhoods such as Columbia Heights and Logan Circle are becoming safer and vibrant. However, incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents.[363] Even still, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s.[364]\n\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in *District of Columbia v. Heller* that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment.[365] However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.[366]\n\n\nIn addition to the Metropolitan Police Department, several federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city, including the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.[367]\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family.[368] Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy.[369] Listed in the order each agreement was first established, they are:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand (1962, renewed 2002 and 2012)\n* ![](image) Dakar, Senegal (1980, renewed 2006)\n* ![](image) Beijing, China (1984, renewed 2004 and 2012)\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium (1985, renewed 2002 and 2011)\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece (2000)\n* ![](image) Paris, France (2000 as a friendship and cooperation agreement, renewed 2005)[369][370]\n* ![](image) Pretoria, South Africa (2002, renewed 2008 and 2011)\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea (2006)\n* ![](image) Accra, Ghana (2006)\n* ![](image) Sunderland, United Kingdom (2006, renewed 2012)[368]\n* ![](image) Rome, Italy (2011, renewed 2013)[369]\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey (2011)\n* ![](image) Brasília, Brazil (2013)\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2013)[371]\n* ![](image) San Salvador, El Salvador (2018)\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nList of people from Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Index of Washington, D.C.–related articles\n* Outline of Washington, D.C.\n* USS *District of Columbia*\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.[28]\n2. **^** The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast and rotated them to include Alexandria at the district's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.[29]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official records for Washington, D.C. were kept at 24th and M Streets NW from January 1872 to June 1945, and at Reagan National Airport since July 1945.[95]\n5. **^** Apportionment totals are collected by combining Resident and Overseas population. (For D.C., this is 689545 residents and 1988 overseas population.)\n6. **^** Until 1890, the Census Bureau counted the City of Washington, Georgetown, and unincorporated portions of Washington County as three separate areas. The data provided in this article from before 1890 are calculated as if the District of Columbia were a single municipality as it is today. Population data for each city prior to 1890 are available.[128]\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** From 15% sample\n8. **^** The territories of the United States have the highest poverty rates in the United States.[154]\n9. **^** These figures count adherents, meaning all full members, their children, and others who regularly attend services.

Washington, D.C. was named for George Washington, a Founding Father, victorious commanding general of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War, and the first president of the United States who is widely considered the \"Father of his country\".[11][12] The district is named for Columbia, the female personification of the nation.\n\n\nWashington, D.C. anchors the southern end of the Northeast megalopolis, one of the nation's largest and most influential cultural, political, and economic regions that also includes some of the nation's largest and most prominent cities, including Baltimore, Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. As the seat of the U.S. federal government and several international organizations, the city is an important world political capital.[13] The city had 20.7 million domestic visitors[14] and 1.2 million international visitors, ranking 7th in the U.S., in 2022.[15]\n\n\nThe U.S. Constitution provides for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. As such, Washington, D.C. is not part of any state, nor is it one itself. The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and Congress held its first session there in 1800. In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria, was officially recognized as the federal district; the city initially comprised only a portion of its modern territory, as a distinct entity within the larger federal district.[16] In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district, though locally elected government lasted only three years and did not return for over a century.[17] There have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s; a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the U.S. Senate.[18]\n\n\nDesigned in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the city is divided into quadrants, which are centered around the Capitol and include 131 neighborhoods. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,545,[3] making it the 23rd-most populous city in the U.S., third-most populous city in the Southeast after Jacksonville and Charlotte, and third-most populous city in the Mid-Atlantic after New York City and Philadelphia.[19] Commuters from the city's Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek.[20] The Washington metropolitan area, which includes parts of Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, is the country's sixth-largest metropolitan area with a 2020 population of 6.3 million residents.[21]\n\n\nThe city hosts all three branches of the U.S. federal government, Congress (legislative), the president (executive), and the Supreme Court (judicial), and the governmental buildings that house most of the federal government, including the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme Court Building, and multiple federal departments and agencies. The city is home to many national monuments and museums, located primarily on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, and other international organizations. Many of the nation's largest industry associations, non-profit organizations, and think tanks are based in the city, including AARP, American Red Cross, Atlantic Council, Brookings Institution, National Geographic Society, The Heritage Foundation, Wilson Center, and others.\n\n\nA locally elected mayor and 13-member council have governed the district since 1973, though Congress is empowered to overturn local laws. Washington, D.C. residents are, on a federal level, politically disenfranchised since the city's residents do not have voting representation in Congress, although the city's residents elect a single at-large congressional delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives who has no voting authority. The city's voters choose three presidential electors in accordance with the Twenty-third Amendment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Washington, D.C.\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Washington, D.C.\n\nVarious tribes of the Algonquian-speaking Piscataway people, also known as the Conoy, inhabited the lands around the Potomac River and present-day Washington, D.C. when Europeans first arrived and colonized the region in the early 17th century. The Nacotchtank, also called the Nacostines by Catholic missionaries, maintained settlements around the Anacostia River in present-day Washington, D.C. Conflicts with European colonists and neighboring tribes ultimately forced the Piscataway people to relocate, some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near Point of Rocks, Maryland.[22]\n\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Built in 1765, Old Stone House in Georgetown is the city's oldest still standing building.\n![](image)James Hoban's 1793 plans for what today is the White House\n![](image)In 1800, following relocation of the nation's capital from Philadelphia, the U.S. Congress began assembling in the newly constructed United States Capitol.\nPrior to the establishment of the city as the nation's capital in 1800, the nation's capital was Philadelphia, which served as the capital on five separate occasions during the American Revolution and its aftermath from May 1775 to July 1776, December 1776 to February 1777, March 1777 to September 1777, July 1778, July 1778 to March 1781, and March 1781 to June 1783. The Continental Congress was briefly based in five additional locations: York, Pennsylvania in September 1777, Princeton, New Jersey in 1783, Annapolis, Maryland from November 1783 to August 1784, Trenton, New Jersey from November to December 1784, and New York City from January 1785 to March 1789.\n\n\nOn October 6, 1783, after the capital was forced by the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey, Congress resolved to consider a new location for it.[23] The following day, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts moved \"that buildings for the use of Congress be erected on the banks of the Delaware near Trenton, or of the Potomac, near Georgetown, provided a suitable district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid, for a federal town\".[24]\n\n\nIn Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.[25] The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security.[26]\n\n\nArticle One, Section Eight of the U.S. Constitution permits the establishment of a \"District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States\".[27] However, the constitution does not specify a location for the capital. In the Compromise of 1790, Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson agreed that the federal government would pay each state's remaining Revolutionary War debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the Southern United States.[28][a]\n\n\nOn July 9, 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River. Under the Residence Act, the exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16, 1790. Formed from land donated by Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side and totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).[29][b]\n\n\nTwo pre existing settlements were included in the territory, the port of Georgetown, founded in 1751,[30] and the port city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749.[31] In 1791 and 1792, a team led by Andrew Ellicott, including Ellicott's brothers Joseph and Benjamin and African American astronomer Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point; many of these stones are still standing.[32][33]\n\n\nA new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac River, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The same day, the federal district was named Columbia, a feminine form of Columbus, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly used at that time.[34][35] Congress held its first session there on November 17, 1800.[36][37]\n\n\nCongress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. The area within the district was organized into two counties, the County of Washington to the east and north of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west and south.[38] After the Act's passage, citizens in the district were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which ended their representation in Congress.[39]\n\n\n\n### Burning during War of 1812[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Burning of Washington\n\n![](image)The August 24, 1814, burning of Washington by British forces during the War of 1812, depicted in an 1816 portrait\n![](image)*City of Washington from Beyond the Navy Yard*, an 1833 portrait of Washington, D.C. by George Cooke featuring the Anacostia River (foreground), the Potomac River (left), and Capitol Hill (center-right)\nOn August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812, British forces invaded and occupied the city after defeating an American force at Bladensburg. In retaliation for acts of destruction by American troops in the Canadas, the British set fire to multiple government buildings in the city, including the United States Capitol, the Treasury Building and the White House. All the buildings set on fire were gutted in what became known as the burning of Washington. However, a storm forced the British to evacuate the city after just 24 hours.[40] Most government buildings were repaired quickly; however, the Capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.[41]\n\n\n\n### Retrocession and the Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: District of Columbia retrocession and Washington, D.C., in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)The U.S. Capitol dome was under construction during Lincoln's first inauguration on March 4, 1861; five weeks later, the American Civil War was launched following the Confederate bombardment and fall of Fort Sumter on April 13, 1861.\nIn the 1830s, the district's southern territory of Alexandria declined economically due in part to neglect of it by Congress.[42] Alexandria was a major market in the domestic slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the district, further depressing the local economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocession.[43]\n\n\nThe Virginia General Assembly voted in February 1846, to accept the return of Alexandria. On July 9, 1846, Congress went further, agreeing to return all territory that Virginia had ceded to the district during its formation. This left the district's area consisting only of the portion originally donated by Maryland.[42] Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, the Compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district, although not slavery itself.[44]\n\n\nThe outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the city's population, including a large influx of freed slaves.[45] President Abraham Lincoln signed the Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862, which ended slavery in the district, freeing about 3,100 slaves in the district nine months prior to the Emancipation Proclamation.[46] In 1868, Congress granted the district's African American male residents the right to vote in municipal elections.[45]\n\n\n\n### Growth and redevelopment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: City Beautiful movement\n\n![](image)The Eisenhower Executive Office Building, built between 1871 and 1888, was the world's largest office building from its opening until 1943, when it was surpassed by The Pentagon.\nBy 1870, the district's population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents.[47] Despite the city's growth, however, Washington still had dirt roads and the city lacked basic sanitation. Some members of Congress suggested moving the capital farther west, but President Ulysses S. Grant refused to consider the proposal.[48]\n\n\nCongress passed the Organic Act of 1871, which repealed the individual charters of the cities of Washington and Georgetown, abolished Washington County, and created a new territorial government for the whole District of Columbia[49] and making \"the city of Washington...legally indistinguishable from the District of Columbia.\"[16]\n\n\nAfter the reorganization, in 1873, President Grant appointed Alexander Robey Shepherd as Governor of the District of Columbia. Shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized the city but ultimately bankrupted the district government. In 1874, Congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners.[50]\n\n\nIn 1888, the city's first motorized streetcars began service. Their introduction generated growth in areas of the district beyond the City of Washington's original boundaries, leading to an expansion of the district over the next few decades.[51] Georgetown's street grid and other administrative details were formally merged to those of the City of Washington in 1895.[52] However, the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works, leading it to become the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the City Beautiful movement in the early 20th century.[53]\n\n\nThe City Beautiful movement built heavily upon the already-implemented L'Enfant Plan, with the new McMillan Plan leading urban development in the city throughout the movement. Much of the old Victorian Mall was replaced with modern Neoclassical and Beaux-Arts architecture; these designs are still prevalent in the city's governmental buildings today.\n\n\nIncreased federal spending as a result of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in the district,[54] though the chairman of the House Subcommittee on District Appropriations Ross A. Collins from Mississippi justified cuts to funds for welfare and education for local residents, saying that \"my constituents wouldn't stand for spending money on niggers.\"[55]\n\n\nWorld War II led to an expansion of federal employees in the city;[56] by 1950, the district's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.[47]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights and home rule era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1968 Washington, D.C., riots and District of Columbia home rule\n\n![](image)The March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool on August 28, 1963\nThe Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1961, granting the district three votes in the Electoral College for the election of president and vice president, but still not affording the city's residents representation in Congress.[57]\n\n\nAfter the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, riots broke out in the city, primarily in the U Street, 14th Street, 7th Street, and H Street corridors, which were predominantly black residential and commercial areas. The riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops and Washington, D.C. Army National Guardsmen stopped the violence. Many stores and other buildings were burned, and rebuilding from the riots was not completed until the late 1990s.[58]\n\n\nIn 1973, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Home Rule Act providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district.[59] In 1975, Walter Washington became the district's first elected and first black mayor.[60]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the D.C. statehood movement has grown in prominence. In 2016, a referendum on D.C. statehood resulted in an 85% support among Washington, D.C. voters for it to become the nation's 51st state. In March 2017, the city's congressional delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced a bill for statehood. Reintroduced in 2019 and 2021 as the Washington, D.C., Admission Act, the U.S. House of Representatives passed it in April 2021. After not progressing in the Senate, the statehood bill was introduced again in January 2023.[61]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Washington Monument viewed from the Tidal Basin during the National Cherry Blossom Festival in April 2018\nWashington, D.C., is located in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. East Coast. The city has a total area of 68.34 square miles (177 km2), of which 61.05 square miles (158.1 km2) is land and 7.29 square miles (18.9 km2) (10.67%) is water.[62] The district is bordered by Montgomery County, Maryland, to the northwest; Prince George's County, Maryland, to the east; Arlington County, Virginia, to the west; and Alexandria, Virginia, to the south. Washington is 38 miles (61 km) from Baltimore, 124 miles (200 km) from Philadelphia, 227 miles (365 km) from New York City, 242 miles (389 km) from Pittsburgh, 384 miles (618 km) from Charlotte, and 439 miles (707 km) from Boston.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe south bank of the Potomac River forms the district's border with Virginia and has two major tributaries, the Anacostia River and Rock Creek.[63] Tiber Creek, a natural watercourse that once passed through the National Mall, was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s.[64] The creek also formed a portion of the now-filled Washington City Canal, which allowed passage through the city to the Anacostia River from 1815 until the 1850s.[65] The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal starts in Georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the Little Falls of the Potomac River, located at the northwest edge of the city at the Atlantic Seaboard fall line.[66]\n\n\nThe highest natural elevation in the district is 409 feet (125 m) above sea level at Fort Reno Park in upper northwest Washington, D.C.[67] The lowest point is sea level at the Potomac River.[68] The geographic center of Washington is near the intersection of 4th and L Streets NW.[69][70][71]\n\n\nThe district has 7,464 acres (30.21 km2) of parkland, about 19% of the city's total area and the second-highest percentage among high-density U.S. cities after Philadelphia.[72] The city's sizable parkland was a factor in the city being ranked as third in the nation for park access and quality in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the park systems of the nation's 100 most populous cities, according to Trust for Public Land, a non-profit organization.[73]\n\n\nThe National Park Service manages most of the 9,122 acres (36.92 km2) of city land owned by the U.S. government.[74] Rock Creek Park is a 1,754-acre (7.10 km2) urban forest in Northwest Washington, which extends 9.3 miles (15.0 km) through a stream valley that bisects the city. Established in 1890, it is the country's fourth-oldest national park and is home to a variety of plant and animal species, including raccoon, deer, owls, and coyotes.[75] Other National Park Service properties include the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, the National Mall and Memorial Parks, Theodore Roosevelt Island, Columbia Island, Fort Dupont Park, Meridian Hill Park, Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens, and Anacostia Park.[76] The District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation maintains the city's 900 acres (3.6 km2) of athletic fields and playgrounds, 40 swimming pools, and 68 recreation centers.[77] The U.S. Department of Agriculture operates the 446-acre (1.80 km2) United States National Arboretum in Northeast Washington, D.C.[78]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Climate change in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Key Bridge (background) and an iced-over Potomac River (foreground) in February 2004\nWashington's climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: *Cfa*), or oceanic (Trewartha: *Do* bordering *Cf* downtown).[79][80] Winters are cool to cold with some snow of varying intensity, while summers are hot and humid. The district is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city.[81][82]\n\n\nSummers are hot and humid with a July daily average of 79.8 °F (26.6 °C) and average daily relative humidity around 66%, which can cause moderate personal discomfort. Heat indices regularly approach 100 °F (38 °C) at the height of summer.[83] The combination of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area.[84]\n\n\nBlizzards affect Washington once every four to six years on average. The most violent storms, known as nor'easters, often impact large regions of the East Coast.[85] From January 27 to 28, 1922, the city officially received 28 inches (71 cm) of snowfall, the largest snowstorm since official measurements began in 1885.[86] According to notes kept at the time, the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm) from a snowstorm in January 1772.[87]\n\n\nHurricanes or their remnants occasionally impact the area in late summer and early fall. However, they usually are weak by the time they reach Washington, partly due to the city's inland location.[88] Flooding of the Potomac River, however, caused by a combination of high tide, storm surge, and runoff, has been known to cause extensive property damage in the Georgetown neighborhood of the city.[89] Precipitation occurs throughout the year.[90]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 6, 1918, and on July 20, 1930.[91] The lowest recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) on February 11, 1899, right before the Great Blizzard of 1899.[85] During a typical year, the city averages about 37 days at or above 90 °F (32 °C) and 64 nights at or below the freezing mark (32 °F or 0 °C).[92] On average, the first day with a minimum at or below freezing is November 18 and the last day is March 27.[93][94]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Washington, D.C.

In 1791, President George Washington commissioned Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant, a French-born architect and city planner, to design the new capital, and enlisted Scottish surveyor Alexander Ralston to help lay out the city plan.[99] The L'Enfant Plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles, providing room for open space and landscaping.[100] L'Enfant based his design on plans of other major world cities, including Paris, Amsterdam, Karlsruhe, and Milan that Thomas Jefferson had sent to him.[101]: 22 L'Enfant's design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) in length and 400 feet (120 m) wide in area that is now the National Mall.[102] In March 1792, however, President Washington dismissed L'Enfant due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital's construction. Andrew Ellicott, who worked with L'Enfant in surveying the city, was then tasked with completing its design. Though Ellicott revised the original L'Enfant plans, including changing some street patterns, L'Enfant is still credited with the city's overall design.[103]\n\n\nBy the early 20th century, however, L'Enfant's vision of a grand national capital was marred by slums and randomly placed buildings in the city, including a railroad station on the National Mall. Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core.[53] What became known as the McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included relandscaping the Capitol grounds and the National Mall, clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design for the city.[100]\n\n\nBy law, the city's skyline is low and sprawling. The federal Height of Buildings Act of 1910 prohibits buildings exceeding the width of the adjacent street plus 20 feet (6.1 m).[104] Despite popular belief, no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the United States Capitol or the 555-foot (169 m) Washington Monument,[71] which remains the district's tallest structure. City leaders have criticised the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused partly by suburban sprawl.[104] Washington D.C. still has a relatively high homelessness rate, despite its high living standard compared to many American cities.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\nWashington, D.C. is divided into four quadrants of unequal area: Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW). The axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the U.S. Capitol.[105] All road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the Capitol. Most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east–west streets named with letters (e.g., C Street SW), north–south streets with numbers (e.g., 4th Street NW), and diagonal avenues, many of which are named after states.[105]\n\n* Selection of neighborhoods in Washington, D.C.\n* ![Bloomingdale](image)\n\nBloomingdale\n* ![Capitol Hill](image)\n\nCapitol Hill\n* ![Cathedral Heights](image)\n\nCathedral Heights\n* ![Chinatown](image)\n\nChinatown\n* ![Columbia Heights](image)\n\nColumbia Heights\n* ![Dupont Circle](image)\n\nDupont Circle\n* ![Edgewood](image)\n\nEdgewood\n* ![Georgetown](image)\n\nGeorgetown\n* ![Logan Circle](image)\n\nLogan Circle\n* ![Navy Yard](image)\n\nNavy Yard\n\n\nThe City of Washington was bordered by Boundary Street to the north, later renamed Florida Avenue in 1890, Rock Creek to the west, and the Anacostia River to the east.[51][100] Washington, D.C.'s street grid was extended, where possible, throughout the district starting in 1888.[106] Georgetown's streets were renamed in 1895.[52] Some streets are particularly noteworthy, including Pennsylvania Avenue, which connects the White House to the Capitol, and K Street, which houses the offices of many lobbying groups.[107] Constitution Avenue and Independence Avenue, located on the north and south sides of the National Mall, respectively, are home to many of Washington's iconic museums, including the Smithsonian Institution buildings and the National Archives Building. Washington hosts 177 foreign embassies, constituting approximately 297 buildings beyond the more than 1,600 residential properties owned by foreign countries, many of which are on a section of Massachusetts Avenue informally known as Embassy Row.[108]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Lincoln Memorial (foreground), Washington Monument (center), and U.S. Capitol (background) are each built in the Neoclassical motif.\n![](image)The Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront along the Potomac River\n![](image)Victorian houses in Dupont Circle\nThe architecture of Washington, D.C., varies greatly and is generally popular among tourists and locals. In 2007, six of the top ten buildings in the American Institute of Architects' ranking of America's Favorite Architecture were in the city:[109] the White House, Washington National Cathedral, the Jefferson Memorial, the United States Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The neoclassical, Georgian, Gothic, and Modern styles are reflected among these six structures and many other prominent edifices in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany of the government buildings, monuments, and museums along the National Mall and surrounding areas are heavily inspired by classical Roman and Greek architecture. The designs of the White House, the U.S. Capitol, Supreme Court Building, Washington Monument, National Gallery of Art, Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial are all heavily drawn from these classical architectural movements and feature large pediments, domes, columns in classical order, and heavy stone walls. Notable exceptions to the city's classical-style architecture include buildings constructed in the French Second Empire style, including the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.[110] The Thomas Jefferson Building, the main Library of Congress building, and the historic Willard Hotel are built in Beaux-Arts style, popular throughout the world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. [111][112] Meridian Hill Park contains a cascading waterfall with Italian renaissance-style architecture.[113]\n\n\nModern, Postmodern, contemporary, and other non-classical architectural styles are also seen in the city's buildings. The National Museum of African American History and Culture deeply contrasts the stone-based neoclassical buildings on the National Mall with a design that combines modern engineering with heavy inspiration from African art.[114] The interior of the Washington Metro stations and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden are designed with strong influence from the 20th-century Brutalism movement.[115] The Smithsonian Institution Building is built of Seneca red sandstone in the Norman Revival style.[116] The Old Post Office building, located on Pennsylvania Avenue and completed in 1899, was the first building in the city to have a steel frame structure and the first to utilize electrical wiring in its design.[117]\n\n\nNotable contemporary residential buildings, restaurants, shops, and office buildings in the city include the Wharf on the Southwest Waterfront, Navy Yard along the Anacostia River, and CityCenterDC in Downtown. The Wharf, given its proximity to the Potomac River, has seen the construction of several high-rise office and residential buildings overlooking the river. Additionally, restaurants, bars, and shops have been opened at street level. Many of these buildings have a modern glass exterior and heavy curvature.[118][119] CityCenterDC is home to Palmer Alley, a pedestrian-only walkway, and houses several apartment buildings, restaurants, and luxury-brand storefronts with streamlined glass and metal facades.[120]\n\n\nOutside Downtown D.C., architectural styles are more varied. Historic buildings are designed primarily in the Queen Anne, Châteauesque, Richardsonian Romanesque, Georgian Revival, Beaux-Arts, and a variety of Victorian styles.[121] Rowhouses are prominent in areas developed after the Civil War and typically follow Federal and late Victorian designs.[122] Georgetown's Old Stone House, built in 1765, is the oldest-standing building in the city.[123] Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture.[110] The Ronald Reagan Building is the largest building in the district with a total area of approximately 3.1 million square feet (288,000 m2).[124] Washington Union Station is designed from a combination of different architectural styles. Its Great Hall, which serves as the main hall within the building, has elaborate gold leaf designs along the ceilings and the hall includes several decorative classical-style statues.[125]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 8,144 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 15,471 |  | 90.0% |\n| 1820 | 23,336 |  | 50.8% |\n| 1830 | 30,261 |  | 29.7% |\n| 1840 | 33,745 |  | 11.5% |\n| 1850 | 51,687 |  | 53.2% |\n| 1860 | 75,080 |  | 45.3% |\n| 1870 | 131,700 |  | 75.4% |\n| 1880 | 177,624 |  | 34.9% |\n| 1890 | 230,392 |  | 29.7% |\n| 1900 | 278,718 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1910 | 331,069 |  | 18.8% |\n| 1920 | 437,571 |  | 32.2% |\n| 1930 | 486,869 |  | 11.3% |\n| 1940 | 663,091 |  | 36.2% |\n| 1950 | 802,178 |  | 21.0% |\n| 1960 | 763,956 |  | −4.8% |\n| 1970 | 756,510 |  | −1.0% |\n| 1980 | 638,333 |  | −15.6% |\n| 1990 | 606,900 |  | −4.9% |\n| 2000 | 572,059 |  | −5.7% |\n| 2010 | 601,723 |  | 5.2% |\n| 2020 | 689,545 |  | 14.6% |\n| Source:[126] [e][47][127] Note:[f]2010–2020[3] |\n\n\n\n\n| Demographic profile\n | 2020[129] | 2010[130] | 1990[131] | 1970[131] | 1940[131] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 39.6% | 38.5% | 29.6% | 27.7% | 71.5%\n |\n|  —Non-Hispanic whites | 38.0% | 34.8% | 27.4% | 26.5%[g] | 71.4%\n |\n| Black or African American | 41.4% | 50.7% | 65.8% | 71.1% | 28.2%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race)\n | 11.3% | 9.1% | 5.4% | 2.1%[g] | 0.1%\n |\n| Asian | 4.8% | 3.5% | 1.8% | 0.6% | 0.2%\n |\n\n\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in the Washington metropolitan area, according to the 2010 U.S. census. Each dot represents 25 people: **White**, **Black**, **Asian**, **Hispanic** or **Other** (yellow)\nThe U.S. Census Bureau estimates that the district's population was 705,749 as of July 2019, an increase of more than 100,000 people compared to the 2010 United States Census. When measured on a decade-over-decade basis, this continues a growth trend since 2000, following a half-century of population decline.[132] But on a year-over-year basis, the July 2019 census count shows a population decline of 16,000 individuals over the preceding 12-month period.[133][*unreliable source?*] Washington was the 24th most populous place in the United States as of 2010[update].[134] According to data from 2010, commuters from the suburbs increase the district's daytime population to over a million.[135] If the district were a state it would rank 49th in population, ahead of Vermont and Wyoming.[136]\n\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area, which includes the district and surrounding suburbs, is the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the U.S. with an estimated six million residents as of 2016.[137] When the Washington area is included with Baltimore and its suburbs, it forms the vast Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area. With a population exceeding 9.8 million residents in 2020, it is the third-largest combined statistical area in the country.[138]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 4,410 homeless people in Washington, D.C.[139][140]\n\n\nAccording to 2017 Census Bureau data, the population of Washington, D.C. was 47.1% Black or African American, 45.1% White (36.8% non-Hispanic White), 4.3% Asian, 0.6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Individuals from two or more races made up 2.7% of the population. Hispanics of any race made up 11.0% of the district's population.[136]\n\n\nWashington, D.C. has had a significant African American population since the city's foundation.[141] African American residents composed about 30% of the district's total population between 1800 and 1940.[47] The black population reached a peak of 70% by 1970, but has since steadily declined due to many African Americans moving to the surrounding suburbs. Partly as a result of gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.[142] According to a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, D.C. has experienced more \"intense\" gentrification than any other American city, with 40% of neighborhoods gentrified.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 17% of Washington, D.C. residents were age 18 or younger as of 2010, lower than the U.S. average of 24%. However, at 34 years old, the district had the lowest median age compared to the 50 states as of 2010.[144] As of 2010[update], there were an estimated 81,734 immigrants living in Washington, D.C.[145] Major sources of immigration include El Salvador, Ethiopia, Mexico, Guatemala, and China, with a concentration of Salvadorans in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood.[146]\n\n\nAs of 2010, there were 4,822 same-sex couples in the city, about 2% of total households, according to Williams Institute.[147] Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009, and the district began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.[148]\n\n\n\nReligious buildings in Washington, D.C.\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSeveral major religious buildings in Washington, D.C. (left to right from the top): The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, Adas Israel Synagogue, Islamic Center of Washington, and Calvary Baptist Church\n\nAs of 2007, approximately a third of Washington, D.C., residents were functionally illiterate compared to a national rate of about one in five. The city's relatively high illiteracy rate is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient in English.[149] As of 2011[update], 85% of D.C. residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language.[150] Half of residents had at least a four-year college degree in 2006.[145] In 2017, the median household income in D.C. was $77,649;[151] also in 2017, D.C. residents had a personal income per capita of $50,832 (higher than any of the 50 states).[151][152] However, 19% of residents were below the poverty level in 2005, higher than any state except Mississippi. In 2019, the poverty rate stood at 14.7%.[153][h][155]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], more than 90% of Washington, D.C., residents had health insurance coverage, the second-highest rate in the nation. This is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage.[156] A 2009 report found that at least three percent of Washington, D.C., residents have HIV or AIDS, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) characterizes as a \"generalized and severe\" epidemic.[157]\n\n\nOf the district's population, 17% are Baptist, 13% are Catholic, 6% are evangelical Protestant, 4% are Methodist, 3% are Episcopalian or Anglican, 3% are Jewish, 2% are Eastern Orthodox, 1% are Pentecostal, 1% are Buddhist, 1% are Adventist, 1% are Lutheran, 1% are Muslim, 1% are Presbyterian, 1% are Mormon, and 1% are Hindu.[158][i] The city is populated with many religious buildings, including the Washington National Cathedral, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, which comprises the largest Catholic church building in the United States, and the Islamic Center of Washington, which was the largest mosque in the Western Hemisphere when opened in 1957. St. John's Episcopal Church, located off Lafayette Square, has held services for every U.S. president since James Madison. The Sixth & I Historic Synagogue, built in 1908, is a synagogue located in the Chinatown section of the city. The Washington D.C. Temple is a large Mormon temple located just outside the city in Kensington, Maryland. Viewable from the Capital Beltway, the temple is the tallest Mormon temple in existence and the third-largest by square footage.[159][160]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McPherson Square in Downtown\nAs of 2023, the Washington metropolitan area, including District of Columbia as well as parts of Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, was one of the nation's largest metropolitan economies. Its growing and diversified economy has an increasing percentage of professional and business service jobs in addition to more traditional jobs rooted in tourism, entertainment, and government.[161][*obsolete source*]\n\n\nBetween 2009 and 2016, gross domestic product per capita in Washington, D.C., consistently ranked at the very top among U.S. states.[162] In 2016, at $160,472, its GDP per capita was almost three times greater than that of Massachusetts, which was ranked second in the nation.[162]\nAs of 2022[update], the metropolitan statistical area's unemployment rate was 3.1%, ranking 171 out of the 389 metropolitan areas as defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.[163] The District of Columbia itself had an unemployment rate of 4.6% during the same time period.[164] In 2019, Washington, D.C., had the highest median household income in the U.S. at $92,266.[165]\n\n\nAccording to the District's comprehensive annual financial reports, the top employers by number of employees in 2022 included Georgetown University, Children's National Medical Center, Washington Hospital Center, George Washington University, American University, Georgetown University Hospital, Booz Allen & Hamilton, Insperity PEO Services, Universal Protection Service, Howard University, Medstar Medical Group, George Washington University Hospital, Catholic University of America, and Sibley Memorial Hospital.[166]\n\n\n\n### Federal government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal government of the United States\n\n![](image)Federal Triangle, a historic hub of executive departments of the U.S. federal government\nAs of July 2022, 25% of people employed in Washington, D.C., were employed by the federal government.[167] The vast majority of these government employees serve in various executive branch departments, agencies, and institutions, and only a small percentage serve as temporary staff for presidents, Congress members, or in the federal judiciary.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany of the region's residents work for companies and organizations that sign contracts with the federal government or work on issues directly related to the work of the federal government, including law firms, defense contractors, civilian contractors, nonprofit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations, many of which have their headquarters in or near Washington, D.C., in order to maintain proximity to the federal government. The largest U.S. government agencies located in or near the city are: the United States Department of Defense headquartered in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, the United States Postal Service, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the United States Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Department of Justice.[168]\n\n\n\n### Diplomacy and global finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States\nWashington, D.C. hosts more than 175 embassies, ambassador's residences and international cultural centers. Embassy Row is the informal name given to a stretch of Massachusetts Avenue that is occupied by many of the city's foreign embassies.[169] Washington, D.C., is one of the most diverse cities in the world.[170] In 2008, the foreign diplomatic corps in the city employed approximately 10,000 people and contributed an estimated $400 million annually to the local economy.[171]\n\n\nMany prominent global financial and diplomatic institutions are headquartered in the city, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Pan American Health Organization. These institutions seek to use money lending and run development programs, among other financial and economic tools, to improve the economy and development of countries across the globe.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve, which is the central bank of the U.S., is located on Constitution Avenue. Commonly called The Fed, its policies are made by the members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Through monetary policy, the Board adjusts various interest rates in the U.S., which heavily impacts the U.S. economy and economies for countries across the world. Because of the power of the U.S. dollar, the actions of the Board are monitored closely by political, economic, and diplomatic leaders around the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Research and non-profit organizations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)K Street, historically a hub for lobbying firms and advocacy groups\n![](image)The United States Institute of Peace, a Foggy Bottom-based foreign policy think tank created by federal legislation in 1984\nWashington, D.C., is a leading center for national and international research organizations, especially think tanks that engage in public policy.[172] Several of the nation's largest and most cited think tanks are headquartered in the city, including the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Center for Strategic and International Studies, Peterson Institute for International Economics, The Heritage Foundation, Urban Institute, and others.[173] As of 2020, 8% of the country's think tanks are headquartered in Washington, D.C.[174] Many non-think tanks are also leading research centers, such as the MedStar Washington Hospital Center and the Children's National Medical Center.[175]\n\n\nThe city is home to many non-profit organizations that engage with issues of domestic and global importance by conducting advanced research, running programs, or advocating on behalf of people. Many of these organizations are headquartered or have major offices in the city. Among these organizations are the UN Foundation, Human Rights Campaign, Amnesty International, and the National Endowment for Democracy.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city is also the country's primary location for international development firms, many of whom find funding by contracting with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which is the U.S. federal government's aid agency and is located in the city. The American Red Cross, a humanitarian agency focused on emergency relief, is also headquartered in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Private sector[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Companies based in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Bond Building, built in 1901, a historic office building in Downtown\n![](image)Headquarters of Jones Day, the nation's ninth-largest law firm as of 2023\nAccording to statistics compiled in 2011, four of the largest 500 companies in the country were headquartered in Washington, D.C.[176] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Washington was ranked as having the 14th most competitive financial center in the world, and fourth most competitive in the United States (after New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles).[177] Among the largest companies headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area are Fannie Mae, Amtrak, Lockheed Martin, Marriot International, Hilton Worldwide, Danaher Corporation, FTI Consulting, and Hogan Lovells.[178]\n\n\nDue to the building height restrictions in Washington, D.C., taller buildings are able to be built in suburban Maryland and Virginia. Capital One Bank, which is one of the largest banks in the country, is headquartered in nearby Tysons, Virginia, a large and growing financial center located in Fairfax County, Virginia. The headquarters building for Capital One Bank, known as Capital One Tower, is the tallest occupied building in the Washington region. In 2018, Amazon announced it would build a second headquarters building, known as HQ2, in the Crystal City neighborhood of Arlington County, Virginia, which is located just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.[179] In addition to Capital One, some of the largest companies headquartered in Northern Virginia include Hilton, Navy Federal Credit Union, Mars, Freddie Mac, Northrop Grumman, and General Dynamics.[180]\n\n\nThe Washington, D.C., economy also benefits from being home to many prominent news and media organizations. Among these are *The Washington Post*, *The Washington Times*, *Politico*, and *The Hill*. Television and radio media organizations either headquartered in or near the city or with large offices in the region, include CNN, PBS, C-SPAN, CBS, NBC, Discovery, and NPR, and others. The Gannett Company, which owns *USA Today*, the nation's largest circulation newspaper, and other media outlets, is headquartered in Tysons, Virginia.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St. Regis Hotel on 16th Street\nTourism is the city's second-largest industry, after the federal government. Approximately 18.9 million visitors contributed an estimated $4.8 billion to the local economy in 2012.[183] In 2019, the number of tourists who visited the city increased to 24.6 million, of which 22.8 million were domestic tourists. In total, the tourists spent $8.15 billion during their stay.[184] This heavy tourism helps many of the region's other industries, such as lodging, food and beverage, entertainment, shopping, and transportation.[184] Additionally, tourism helps the city maintain a robust network of world-class museums and cultural centers, most notably the Smithsonian Institution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city and wider Washington region has a diverse array of attractions for tourists, such as monuments, memorials, museums, sports events, and trails. Within the city, the National Mall serves as the center of the tourism industry. It is there that many of the city's museums and monuments are located. Adjacent to the mall sits the Tidal Basin, where several additional memorials and monuments lie, including the popular Jefferson Memorial. Additionally, Union Station is a very popular tourist spot with its multitude of restaurants and shops.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAmong the most visited tourist destinations is Arlington National Cemetery in nearby Arlington County, Virginia.[185] This is a military cemetery that serves as a burial ground for former military combatants. It is also the location of President John F. Kennedy's tomb, marked by an eternal flame.[186] President William Howard Taft is also buried in Arlington.[187] The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located in the cemetery and is guarded 24/7 by a tomb guard. The changing of the guard is a popular tourist attraction and occurs once every hour from October through March and every half-hour during the rest of the year.[188]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSymbols of District of Columbia| Slogan | Federal City |\n| Living insignia |\n| Bird | Wood Thrush |\n| Crustacean | Hay's Spring amphipod |\n| Fish | American shad |\n| Flower | American Beauty rose |\n| Mammal | Little brown bat |\n| Tree | Scarlet Oak |\n| Inanimate insignia |\n| Beverage | Rickey[189] |\n| Dance | Hand dancing |\n| Dinosaur | *Capitalsaurus* |\n| Food | Cherry |\n| Rock | Potomac bluestone |\n| Route marker |\n| ![District of Columbia Route 295 marker](image)\n |\n| State quarter |\n| ![quarter dollar coin](image)Released in 2009\n |\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Washington, D.C.\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Theater in Washington, D.C. and Music of Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The Kennedy Center, home to the Washington National Opera and National Symphony Orchestra\n![](image)The Howard Theatre is located in the Shaw neighborhood.\nWashington, D.C. is a national center for the arts and houses several concert halls and theaters. The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is home to the National Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, and the Washington Ballet. The Kennedy Center Honors are awarded each year to those in the performing arts who have contributed greatly to the cultural life of the United States. This ceremony is often attended by the sitting U.S. president and other dignitaries and celebrities.[190] The Kennedy Center also awards the annual Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe historic Ford's Theatre, site of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, continues to function as a theatre and as a museum.[191]\n\n\nThe Marine Barracks near Capitol Hill houses the United States Marine Band; founded in 1798, it is the country's oldest professional musical organization.[192] American march composer and Washington-native John Philip Sousa led the Marine Band from 1880 until 1892.[193] Founded in 1925, the United States Navy Band has its headquarters at the Washington Navy Yard and performs at official events and public concerts around the city.[194]\n\n\nFounded in 1950, Arena Stage achieved national attention and spurred growth in the city's independent theater movement that now includes organizations such as the Shakespeare Theatre Company, Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, and the Studio Theatre.[195] Arena Stage opened its newly renovated home in the city's emerging Southwest waterfront area in 2010.[196] The GALA Hispanic Theatre, now housed in the historic Tivoli Theatre in Columbia Heights, was founded in 1976 and is a National Center for the Latino Performing Arts.[197]\n\n\nOther performing arts spaces in the city include the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Federal Triangle, the Atlas Performing Arts Center on H Street, the Carter Barron Amphitheater in Rock Creek Park, Constitution Hall in Downtown, the National Theatre in Downtown, the Keegan Theatre in Dupont Circle, the Lisner Auditorium in Foggy Bottom, the Sylvan Theater on the National Mall, and the Warner Theatre in Penn Quarter.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe U Street Corridor in Northwest D.C., once known as \"Washington's Black Broadway\", is home to institutions like Howard Theatre and Lincoln Theatre, which hosted music legends such as Washington-native Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis.[198] Just east of U Street is Shaw, which also served as a major cultural center during the jazz age. Intersecting with U Street is Fourteenth Street, which was an extension of the U Street cultural corridor during the 1920s through the 1960s. The collection of Fourteenth Street, U Street, and Shaw was the location of the Black Renaissance in D.C., which was part of the larger Harlem Renaissance. Today, the area starting at Fourteenth Street downtown going north through U Street and east to Shaw boasts a high concentration of bars, restaurants, and theaters, and is among the city's most notable cultural and artistic areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Records, a major music record label in the US, was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1889.[199][200] The city grew into being one of the most important music cities in the early jazz age. Duke Ellington, among the most prominent jazz composers and musicians of his time, was born and raised in Washington, and began his music career there.\n\n\nWashington has its own native music genre called go-go; a post-funk, percussion-driven flavor of rhythm and blues that was popularized in the late 1970s by D.C. band leader Chuck Brown.[201]\n\n\nThe district is an important center for indie culture and music in the United States. The label Dischord Records, formed by Ian MacKaye, frontman of Fugazi, was one of the most crucial independent labels in the genesis of 1980s punk and eventually indie rock in the 1990s.[202] Modern alternative and indie music venues like The Black Cat and the 9:30 Club bring popular acts to the U Street area.[203] The hardcore punk scene in the city, known as D.C. hardcore, is an important genre of D.C.'s contemporary music scene. Starting in the 1970s, it is considered to be one of the most influential punk music movements in the country.[204]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Michelin starred restaurants in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Ben's Chili Bowl, known for its half-smoke, a historic staple of the city's cuisine\n![](image)Washington has the largest population of Ethiopians outside of Africa. Many have opened restaurants throughout the city. A portion of Shaw is nicknamed \"little Ethiopia\".\nWashington, D.C. is rich in both fine and casual dining and is considered by some to be one of the best cities for dining in the United States.[205] The city has a diverse range of restaurants, including a wide variety of international cuisines.[206] The city's Chinatown, for example, is filled with Chinese-style restaurants. The city also has many Middle Eastern, European, African, Asian, and Latin American cuisine options. D.C. is known for being one of the best cities in the world for Ethiopian cuisine, due in part to the heavy influx of Ethiopian immigrants during the 20th century, many of whom opened restaurants in the city.[207] A part of the Shaw neighborhood in central D.C. is known as \"Little Ethiopia\" and has a high concentration of Ethiopian restaurants and shops.[208]\n\n\nAmong the most famous Washington, D.C.-born foods is the half-smoke, which is a half-beef, half-pork sausage placed in a hotdog-style bun and topped with onion, chilly, and cheese.[209] Additionally, the city is the birthplace of mumbo sauce, a type of condiment often placed on meat and french fries. This sauce is similar to barbecue sauce but sweeter in flavor.[210][211] Washington, D.C. is also known for popularizing the jumbo slice pizza, which is an enlarged New York-style pizza.[212][213][214] The jumbo slice has particular roots in the Adams Morgan neighborhood.[215] Union Market, located in Northeast D.C., is a former farmer's market and wholesale that now houses a large, gourmet food hall.

Wilson Building is the headquarters for much of the Government of the District of Columbia, including the offices of the mayor and D.C. Council.\nArticle One, Section Eight of the United States Constitution grants the United States Congress \"exclusive jurisdiction\" over the city. The district did not have an elected local government until the passage of the 1973 Home Rule Act. The Act devolved certain Congressional powers to an elected mayor and the thirteen-member Council of the District of Columbia. However, Congress retains the right to review and overturn laws created by the council and intervene in local affairs.[269] Washington, D.C., is overwhelmingly Democratic, having voted for the Democratic presidential candidate solidly since it was granted electoral votes in 1964.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEach of the city's eight wards elects a single member of the council and residents elect four at-large members to represent the district as a whole. The council chair is also elected at-large.[270] There are 37 Advisory Neighborhood Commissions (ANCs) elected by small neighborhood districts. ANCs can issue recommendations on all issues that affect residents; government agencies take their advice under careful consideration.[271] The attorney general of the District of Columbia is elected to a four-year term.[272]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., observes all federal holidays and also celebrates Emancipation Day on April 16, which commemorates the end of slavery in the district.[46] The flag of Washington, D.C., was adopted in 1938 and is a variation on George Washington's family coat of arms.[273]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 2015.[274]\n\n\nThe idiom \"Inside the Beltway\" is a reference used by media to describe discussions of national political issues inside of Washington, by way of geographical demarcation regarding the region within the Capital's Beltway, Interstate 495, the city's highway loop (beltway) constructed in 1964. The phrase is used as a title for a number of political columns and news items by publications like *The Washington Times*.[275]\n\n\n\n### Budgetary issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judiciary Square, home to many city and federal government agencies and institutions, including the DC Superior Court, the DC Court of Appeals, the Metropolitan Police Department, Washington Metro, and One Judiciary Square\nThe mayor and council set local taxes and a budget, which Congress must approve. The Government Accountability Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the district's local budget of anywhere between $470 million and over $1 billion per year. Congress typically provides additional grants for federal programs such as Medicaid and the operation of the local justice system; however, analysts claim that the payments do not fully resolve the imbalance.[276][277]\n\n\nThe city's local government, particularly during the mayoralty of Marion Barry, has been criticized for mismanagement and waste.[278] During his administration in 1989, *Washington Monthly* magazine labeled the district \"the worst city government in America\".[279] In 1995, at the start of Barry's fourth term, Congress created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to oversee all municipal spending.[280] Mayor Anthony Williams won election in 1998 and oversaw a period of urban renewal and budget surpluses.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe district regained control over its finances in 2001 and the oversight board's operations were suspended.[281]\n\n\nThe district has a federally funded \"Emergency Planning and Security Fund\" to cover security related to visits by foreign leaders and diplomats, presidential inaugurations, protests, and terrorism concerns. During the Trump administration, the fund has run with a deficit. Trump's January 2017 inauguration cost the city $27 million; of that, $7 million was never repaid to the fund. Trump's 2019 Independence Day event, \"A Salute to America\", cost six times more than Independence Day events in past years.[282]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights debate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District of Columbia voting rights and Political party strength in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)The city's license plate calls for an end to taxation without representation.\nWashington, D.C. is not a state and therefore has no federal voting representation in Congress. The city's residents elect a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives (D.C. at-large), who may sit on committees, participate in debate, and introduce legislation, but cannot vote on the House floor. The district has no official representation in the United States Senate. Neither chamber seats the district's elected \"shadow\" representative or senators. Unlike residents of U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico or Guam, which also have non-voting delegates, D.C. residents are subject to all federal taxes.[283] In the financial year 2012, D.C. residents and businesses paid $20.7 billion in federal taxes, more than the taxes collected from 19 states and the highest federal taxes per capita.[284]\n\n\nA 2005 poll found that 78% of Americans did not know residents of Washington, D.C., have less representation in Congress than residents of the 50 states.[285] Efforts to raise awareness about the issue have included campaigns by grassroots organizations and featuring the city's unofficial motto, \"End Taxation Without Representation\", on D.C. vehicle license plates.[286] There is evidence of nationwide approval for D.C. voting rights; various polls indicate that 61 to 82% of Americans believe D.C. should have voting representation in Congress.[285][287]\n\n\nOpponents to federal voting rights for Washington, D.C., propose that the Founding Fathers never intended for district residents to have a vote in Congress since the Constitution makes clear that representation must come from the states. Those opposed to making District of Columbia a state claim such a move would destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.[288]\n\n\n\n### Homelessness[edit]\n\n\nThe city passed a law that requires shelter to be provided to everyone in need when the temperature drops below freezing.[289] Since D.C. does not have enough shelter units available, every winter it books hotel rooms in the suburbs with an average cost around $100 for a night. According to the D.C. Department of Human Services, during the winter of 2012 the city spent $2,544,454 on putting homeless families in hotels,[290] and budgeted $3.2 million on hotel beds in 2013.[291]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District of Columbia Public Schools and List of parochial and private schools in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Duke Ellington School of the Arts, a public magnet school in the city\nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS), the sole public school district in the city,[292] operates the city's 123 public schools.[293] The number of students in DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009. In the 2010–11 school year, 46,191 students were enrolled in the public school system.[294] DCPS has one of the highest-cost, yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, in terms of both infrastructure and student achievement.[295] Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development.[296]\n\n\nThe District of Columbia Public Charter School Board monitors the 52 public charter schools in the city.[297] Due to the perceived problems with the traditional public school system, enrollment in public charter schools had by 2007 steadily increased.[298] As of 2010, D.C., charter schools had a total enrollment of about 32,000, a 9% increase from the prior year.[294] The district is also home to 92 private schools, which enrolled approximately 18,000 students in 2008.[299]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Georgetown University, founded in 1789, is the city's oldest university.\nThe University of the District of Columbia (UDC) is a public land-grant university providing undergraduate and graduate education.[*citation needed*] Federally chartered universities include American University (AU), Gallaudet University, George Washington University (GWU), Georgetown University (GU), and Howard University (HU).

Other publications based in Washington include the *National Geographic* magazine and political publications such as *The Washington Examiner*, *The New Republic*, and *Washington Monthly*.[315] *USA Today*, which is the largest newspaper in the country as measured by circulation, as well as its parent company Gannett, which is the largest newspaper publisher in the United States,[316] are both headquartered in nearby Tysons, Virginia.[317][318]\n\n\nThe Washington metropolitan area is the ninth-largest television media market in the nation, with two million homes, representing approximately 2% of the country's television market.[319] Several media companies and cable television channels have their headquarters in the area, including C-SPAN, Radio One, the National Geographic Channel, Smithsonian Networks, National Public Radio (NPR), Travel Channel (in Chevy Chase, Maryland), Discovery Communications (in Silver Spring, Maryland), and PBS (in Arlington County, Virginia). The headquarters of Voice of America, the U.S. government's international news service, is near the Capitol in Southwest Washington, D.C.[320]\n\n\nThe city is served by two local NPR affiliates, WAMU and WETA.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Washington, D.C.\n\n#### Streets and highways[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Streets and highways of Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of circles in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Pennsylvania Avenue, one of the city's most prominent streets\nThere are 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of streets, parkways, and avenues in the district.[321] Due to the freeway revolts of the 1960s, much of the proposed interstate highway system through the middle of Washington was never built. Interstate 95 (I-95), the nation's major east coast highway, therefore bends around the district to form the eastern portion of the Capital Beltway. A portion of the proposed highway funding was directed to the region's public transportation infrastructure instead.[322] The interstate highways that continue into Washington, including I-66 and I-395, both terminate shortly after entering the city.[323]\n\n\nAccording to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70 hours a year in traffic delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion.[324] However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public transportation to work, the second-highest rate in the country.[325] An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Cycling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Capital Bikeshare rental station near McPherson Square\nIn May 2022, the city celebrated the expansion of its bike lane network to 104 miles (167 km), a 60 percent increase from 2015. Of those miles, 24 miles (39 km) were protected bike lanes. It also boasted 62 miles (100 km) of bike trails.[327] As of March 2023,[update] the city has 108 miles (174 km) of bike lanes, with 30 miles (48 km) of them protected bike lanes.[328]\n\n\nD.C. is part of the regional Capital Bikeshare program. Started in 2010, it is one of the largest bicycle sharing systems in the country with more than 4,351 bicycles and more than 395 stations,[329] all provided by PBSC Urban Solutions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Walkability[edit]\n\n\nA 2021 study by Walk Score ranked Washington, D.C. the fifth-most walkable city in the country. According to the study, the most walkable neighborhoods are U Street, Dupont Circle, and Mount Vernon Square.[330] In 2013, the Washington Metropolitan Area had the eighth lowest percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (75.7 percent), with 8 percent of area workers traveling via rail transit.[331]\n\n\n\n#### River crossings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of crossings of the Potomac River and List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Memorial Bridge connects the city across the Potomac River with Arlington, Virginia.\nThere are multiple transportation methods to cross the city's two rivers, the Potomac River and the Anacostia River. There are numerous bridges that take cars, trains, pedestrians, and bikers across the rivers. Among these are Arlington Memorial Bridge, the 14th Street Bridges, Francis Scott Key Bridge, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and Frederick Douglass Bridge.[332]\n\n\nThere are also ferries and water cruises that cross the Potomac River. One of these is the Potomac Water Taxi, operated by Hornblower Cruises, which goes between the Georgetown Waterfront, the Wharf, the Old Town Alexandria Waterfront, and National Harbor.[333]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of railroads in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Union Station, the 10th-busiest rail station in the nation\n![](image)Washington Metro, the second-busiest rapid rail system in the U.S. based on average weekday ridership after the New York City Subway\nThe Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) operates the Washington Metro, the city's rapid transit rail system. The system serves Washington, D.C. and its Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs. Metro opened on March 27, 1976, and consists of six lines (each one color coded), 97 stations, and 129 miles (208 km) of track.[334] Metro is the second-busiest rapid transit system in the country and fifth-busiest in North America.[335] It operates mostly as a deep-level subway in more densely populated parts of the D.C. metropolitan area (including most of the District itself), while most of the suburban tracks are at surface level or elevated. Metro is known for its iconic brutalist-style vaulted ceilings in the interior stations. It is also known for having long escalators in some of its underground stations. The longest single-tier escalator in the Western Hemisphere, spanning 230 feet (70 m), is located at Metro's Wheaton station in Maryland.[336]\n\n\nUnion Station is the city's main train station and serves approximately 70,000 people each day. It is Amtrak's second-busiest station with 4.6 million passengers annually and is the southern terminus for the Northeast Corridor, which carries long-distance and regional services to New York Penn Station and points in New England. As of 2023, Union Station is the ninth-busiest rail station in the nation and tenth-busiest in North America.\n\n\nMaryland's MARC and Virginia's VRE commuter trains and the Metrorail Red Line also provide service into Union Station.[337] Following renovations in 2011, Union Station became Washington's primary intercity bus transit center.[338]\n\n\nAlthough Washington, D.C. was known throughout the 19th and early- to mid-20th centuries for its streetcars, these lines were dismantled in the 1960s. In 2016, however, the city brought back a streetcar line, DC Streetcar, which is a single line system in Northeast Washington, D.C., along H Street and Benning Road, known as the H Street/Benning Road Line.[339]\n\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)\n\n![](image)Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\n![](image)DC Circulator, operated by the District Department of Transportation\nTwo main public bus systems operate in Washington, D.C. Metrobus, operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), is the primary public bus system in Washington, D.C. Serving more than 400,000 riders each weekday, it is one of the nation's largest bus systems by annual ridership.[340] The city also operates its own DC Circulator bus system, which connects commercial and touristic areas within central Washington.[341] The DC Circulator costs only $1 to ride and is composed of six distinct routes that cover central D.C. and suburban Rosslyn, Virginia. The DC Circulator is run via a public-private partnerships between the District of Columbia Department of Transportation, WMATA, and DC Surface Transit, Inc. (DCST). The bus system services each stop approximately every 10 minutes.[342]\n\n\nMany other public bus systems operate in the various jurisdictions of the Washington region outside of the city in suburban Maryland and Virginia. Among these are the Fairfax Connector in Fairfax County, Virginia; DASH in Alexandria, Virginia; and TheBus in Prince George's County, Maryland.[343] There are also numerous commuter buses that residents of the wider Washington region take to commute into the city for work or other events. Among these are the Loudoun County Transit Commuter Bus and the Maryland Transit Administration Commuter Bus.[344]\n\n\nThe city also has several bus lines used by tourists and others visiting the city, including Big Bus Tours, Old Town Trolley Tours, and DC Trails. The city also has many charter buses used in carrying young students and other tourists from across the country to the city and region's historic sites. These buses are often found parked beside the city's most notable tourist attractions, including National Mall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aviation in Washington, D.C.; List of airports serving Washington, D.C.; and List of heliports in Washington, D.C.\n\n![](image)Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia is the closest airport to the city among the three major Washington metropolitan area airports.\nThree major airports serve the district, though none are within the city's borders. Two of these major airports are located in suburban Virginia and one in suburban Maryland. The closest is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, which is located in Arlington County, Virginia, just across the Potomac River about 5 miles (8 km) from downtown Washington, D.C. This airport provides primarily domestic flights and has the lowest number of passengers of the three airports in the region. The busiest by number of total passengers is Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI), located in Anne Arundel County, Maryland about 30 miles (48 km) northeast of the city.[345] The busiest by international flights and the largest by land size and amount of facilities is Washington Dulles International Airport, located in Dulles, Virginia, about 24 miles (39 km) west of the city.[346] Dulles has the most international passenger traffic of any airport in the Mid-Atlantic outside the New York metropolitan area, including approximately 90% of the international passenger traffic in the Washington-Baltimore region.[347] Each of these three airports also serves as a hub for a major American airline: Reagan National Airport is a hub for American Airlines,[348] Dulles is a major hub for United Airlines and Star Alliance partners,[349] and BWI is an operating base for Southwest Airlines.[350] In 2018, the Washington, D.C. area was the 18th-busiest airport system in the world by passenger traffic, accumulating over 74 million passengers between its three main commercial airports.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe President of the United States does not use any of these airports for travel. Instead, he typically travels by Marine One from the White House South Lawn to Joint Base Andrews, located in suburban Maryland. From there, he takes Air Force One to his destination. Joint Base Andrews was built in 1942. From 1942 to 2009, it was solely an Air Force base, but became a joint Air Force and Naval base in 2009, when Andrews Air Force Base and Naval Air Facility Washington were merged into a singular entity with the creation of Joint Base Andrews.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, Pepco, and Washington Gas\n\n![](image)The headquarters of DC Water and Sewer Authority on Canal Street, SW, in 2019\nThe District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, also known as WASA or D.C. Water, is an independent authority of the Washington, D.C., government that provides drinking water and wastewater collection in the city. WASA purchases water from the historic Washington Aqueduct, which is operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The water, sourced from the Potomac River, is treated and stored in the city's Dalecarlia, Georgetown, and McMillan reservoirs. The aqueduct provides drinking water for a total of 1.1 million people in the district and Virginia, including Arlington, Falls Church, and a portion of Fairfax County.[351] The authority also provides sewage treatment services for an additional 1.6 million people in four surrounding Maryland and Virginia counties.[352]\n\n\nPepco is the city's electric utility and services 793,000 customers in the district and suburban Maryland.[353] An 1889 law prohibits overhead wires within much of the historic City of Washington. As a result, all power lines and telecommunication cables are located underground in downtown Washington, and traffic signals are placed at the edge of the street.[354] A 2013 plan would bury an additional 60 miles (97 km) of primary power lines throughout the district.[355]\n\n\nWashington Gas is the city's natural gas utility and serves more than a million customers in the district and its suburbs. Incorporated by Congress in 1848, the company installed the city's first gas lights in the Capitol, White House, and along Pennsylvania Avenue.[356]\n\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also: List of law enforcement agencies in the District of Columbia\n\n![](image)Washington, D.C. police on Harley-Davidson motorcycles escort the March for Life protest on Constitution Avenue in January 2018.\nSome 67,000 residents, about 10% of the population, are ex-convicts.[357]\n\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the number of homicides continued an upward trend with over 200 homicides in both years, a significant rise from previous lows.[358] In 2012, D.C.'s annual murder count had dropped to 88, the lowest total since 1961.[359] The city was once described as the \"murder capital\" of the United States during the early 1990s.[360] The number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479, but the level of violence then began to decline significantly.[361]\n\n\nIn 2016, the district's Metropolitan Police Department tallied 135 homicides, a 53% increase from 2012 but a 17% decrease from 2015.[362] Many neighborhoods such as Columbia Heights and Logan Circle are becoming safer and vibrant. However, incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents.[363] Even still, citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s.[364]\n\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in *District of Columbia v. Heller* that the city's 1976 handgun ban violated the right to keep and bear arms as protected under the Second Amendment.[365] However, the ruling does not prohibit all forms of gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban.[366]\n\n\nIn addition to the Metropolitan Police Department, several federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city, including the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.[367]\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nWashington, D.C., has fifteen official sister city agreements. Each of the listed cities is a national capital except for Sunderland, which includes the town of Washington, the ancestral home of George Washington's family.[368] Paris and Rome are each formally recognized as a partner city due to their special one sister city policy.[369] Listed in the order each agreement was first established, they are:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand (1962, renewed 2002 and 2012)\n* ![](image) Dakar, Senegal (1980, renewed 2006)\n* ![](image) Beijing, China (1984, renewed 2004 and 2012)\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium (1985, renewed 2002 and 2011)\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece (2000)\n* ![](image) Paris, France (2000 as a friendship and cooperation agreement, renewed 2005)[369][370]\n* ![](image) Pretoria, South Africa (2002, renewed 2008 and 2011)\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea (2006)\n* ![](image) Accra, Ghana (2006)\n* ![](image) Sunderland, United Kingdom (2006, renewed 2012)[368]\n* ![](image) Rome, Italy (2011, renewed 2013)[369]\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey (2011)\n* ![](image) Brasília, Brazil (2013)\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (2013)[371]\n* ![](image) San Salvador, El Salvador (2018)\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nList of people from Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Index of Washington, D.C.–related articles\n* Outline of Washington, D.C.\n* USS *District of Columbia*\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** By 1790, the Southern states had largely repaid their overseas debts from the Revolutionary War. The Northern states had not, and wanted the federal government to take over their outstanding liabilities. Southern Congressmen agreed to the plan in return for establishing the new national capital at their preferred site on the Potomac River.[28]\n2. **^** The Residence Act allowed the President to select a location within Maryland as far east as the Anacostia River. However, Washington shifted the federal territory's borders to the southeast and rotated them to include Alexandria at the district's southern tip. In 1791, Congress amended the Residence Act to approve the new site, including territory ceded by Virginia.[29]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official records for Washington, D.C. were kept at 24th and M Streets NW from January 1872 to June 1945, and at Reagan National Airport since July 1945.[95]\n5. **^** Apportionment totals are collected by combining Resident and Overseas population.

The city stands on the Moskva River in Central Russia, with a population estimated at 13.0 million residents within the city limits,[6] over 18.8 million residents in the urban area,[7] and over 21.5 million residents in the metropolitan area.[14] The city covers an area of 2,511 square kilometers (970 sq mi), while the urban area covers 5,891 square kilometers (2,275 sq mi),[7] and the metropolitan area covers over 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi).[14] Moscow is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely in Europe, the largest urban and metropolitan area in Europe,[7][14] and the largest city by land area on the European continent.[15]\n\n\nFirst documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. When the Tsardom of Russia was proclaimed, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of its history. Under the reign of Peter the Great, the Russian capital was moved to the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg in 1712, diminishing Moscow's influence. Following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian SFSR, the capital was moved back to Moscow in 1918, where it later became the political center of the Soviet Union.[16] In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained the capital city of the newly established Russian Federation.\n\n\nThe northernmost and coldest megacity in the world, Moscow is governed as a federal city,[17] where it serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of Russia and Eastern Europe. As an alpha world city,[18] Moscow has one of the world's largest urban economies.[19] The city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world,[20] and is one of Europe's most visited cities. Moscow is home to the sixth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[21] The Moscow International Business Center is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world, and features the majority of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[22]\n\n\nAs the historic core of Russia, Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its various museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is well known for its display of Russian architecture, particularly its historic Red Square, and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin, of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the Government of Russia. Moscow is home to many Russian companies in numerous industries and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and most notably the Moscow Metro, the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world. The city has over 40 percent of its territory covered by greenery, making it one of the greenest cities in the world.[15][23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the Moskva River.[24][25] Several theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed. Finno-Ugric Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly *Mustajoki*, in English: *Black river*. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.[26][27]\n\n\nThe most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root \\**mŭzg*-/*muzg*- from the Proto-Indo-European \\**meu*- \"wet\",[25][28][29] so the name *Moskva* might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh.[24] Its cognates include Russian: музга, *muzga* \"pool, puddle\", Lithuanian: *mazgoti* and Latvian: *mazgāt* \"to wash\", Sanskrit: májjati \"to drown\", Latin: *mergō* \"to dip, immerse\".[24][28] In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North Macedonia.[30] Additionally, there are similarly named places in Poland like Mozgawa.[24][25][28]\n\n\nThe original Old Russian form of the name is reconstructed as \\*Москы, \\**Mosky*,[24][25] hence it was one of a few Slavic *ū*-stem nouns. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result, the first written mentions in the 12th century were Московь, *Moskovĭ* (accusative case), Москви, *Moskvi* (locative case), Москвe/Москвѣ, *Moskve/Moskvě* (genitive case).[24][25] From the latter forms came to the modern Russian name Москва, *Moskva*, which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous Slavic *ā*-stem nouns.\n\n\nHowever, the form *Moskovĭ* has left some traces in many other languages, including English: Moscow, German: *Moskau*, French: *Moscou*, Georgian: მოსკოვი, Latvian: *Maskava*, Bashkir: Мәскәү, Tatar: *Mäskäw*, Portuguese: *Moscovo*, Chuvash: Мускав, and Spanish: *Moscú*. \n\n\nIn a similar manner the Latin name *Moscovia* has been formed, later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the 16th–17th centuries. From it as well came English *Muscovy* and *muscovite*.[31][*failed verification*]\n\n\nVarious other theories (of Celtic, Iranian, Caucasic origins), having little or no scientific ground, are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other names[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has acquired several epithets, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The *Third Rome* (Третий Рим), the *Whitestone One* (Белокаменная), the *First Throne* (Первопрестольная), the *Forty Soroks* (Сорок Сороков) (\"sorok\" meaning both \"forty, a great many\" and \"a district or parish\" in Old Russian). Moscow is also one of the twelve Hero Cities. The demonym for a Moscow resident is \"москвич\" (*moskvich*) for male or \"москвичка\" (*moskvichka*) for female, rendered in English as *Muscovite*. The name \"Moscow\" is abbreviated \"MSK\" (МСК in Russian).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Moscow\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Moscow.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nArchaeological digs show that the site of today's Moscow and the surrounding area have been inhabited since time immemorial. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period, the last phase of the Stone Age.[32]\n\n\nThey confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers. Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here. Possibly the Vyatichi formed the core of Moscow's indigenous population.[33]\n\n\n\n### Early history (1147–1284)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kievan Rus' and Vladimir-Suzdal\n\n![](image)Vladimir-Suzdal, a principality on the northeastern periphery of Kievan Rus', grew into the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\nThe first known reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgoruky and Sviatoslav Olgovich. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The chronicle says, \"Come, my brother, to Moskov\" (Приди ко мне, брате, в Москов).[34]\n\n\nIn 1156, Knyaz Yuri Dolgorukiy fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Mongols under Batu Khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe timber fort *na Moskvě* \"on the Moscow River\" was inherited by Daniel, the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.\nDaniel was still a child at the time, and the big fort was governed by *tiuns* (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, Yaroslav of Tver.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDaniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother Dmitry in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.\nDaniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.[35]\n\n\n\n### Grand Duchy (1283–1547)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Duchy of Moscow\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| The Moscow Kremlin in the late 16th century\n | The 1382 siege of Moscow | Red Square |\n\n\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.\n\n\nOn the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, not later than in 1282, Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.\n\n\nMoscow was quite stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Spassky Cathedral (Moscow's oldest extant building), built c. 1357\nWhile the Khan of the Golden Horde initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo. Afterward, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, Ivan III had finally broken the Russians free from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and Siberia, and parts of many other lands.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spasskaya Tower, built in 1491\nIn 1462 Ivan III, (1440–1505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. Thus he enlarged the territory sevenfold, from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometres (170,000 to 1,080,000 square miles). He took control of the ancient \"Novgorod Chronicle\" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.[36][37]\n\n\nThe original Moscow Kremlin was built in the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from Renaissance Italy, such as Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.\n\n\nA trading settlement, or *posad*, grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as *Zaradye* (Зарядье). In the time of Ivan III, the Red Square, originally named the Hollow Field (Полое поле) appeared.\n\n\nIn 1508–1516, the Italian architect Aleviz Fryazin (Novy) arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the Alevizov moat and having a length of 541 metres (1,775 feet), width of 36 metres (118 feet), and a depth of 9.5 to 13 metres (31–43 feet) was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, four-metre-thick (13-foot) cogged-brick walls.\n\n\n\n### Tsardom (1547–1721)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tsardom of Russia\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral, built in 1561\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod (Китай-город), the White City (Белый город) and the Earthen City (Земляной город). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.[38] The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\n\n\n![](image)View of 17th-century Moscow (1922 drawing by Apollinary Vasnetsov)\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy, Danilov, Simonov, Novospasskiy, and Andronikov monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as *Bielokamennaya*, the \"White-Walled.\" The city's limits as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring.\n\n\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Sigismundian\" Plan of Moscow (1610), named after Sigismund III of Poland, is the last city plan compiled before the destruction of the city in 1612 by retreating Polish troops and subsequent changes to the street network. Orientation: north is at the right, west at the top.\nThe Russian famine of 1601–03 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow, as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Polish occupants, besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them. In 1613, the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar, establishing the Romanov dynasty. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. It is estimated, that in the middle of the 17th century, 20% of Moscow suburb's inhabitants were from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, practically all of them being driven from their homeland to Moscow by Muscovite invaders.[39] By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the *Meshchanskaya sloboda*, after Ruthenian *meshchane* \"town people\". The term *meshchane* (мещане) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means \"petty bourgeois\" or \"narrow-minded philistine\".[40]\n\n\nThe entire city of the late 17th century, including the slobodas that grew up outside the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's Central Administrative Okrug.\n\n\nNumerous disasters befell the city. The plague epidemics ravaged Moscow in 1570–1571, 1592 and 1654–1656.[41] The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654–55. Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.[42] In 1712 Peter the Great moved his government to the newly built Saint Petersburg on the Baltic coast. Moscow ceased to be Russia's capital, except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council.\n\n\n\n### Empire (1721–1917)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Governorate\n\nFurther information: Russian Empire\n\n![Panorama of Moscow in 1819-1823](image)\nA panoramic view of Moscow from the Spasskaya Tower in 1819–1823\n\n![](image)Moskva riverfront in the 19th century\nAfter losing the status as the capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915. The 1770–1772 Russian plague killed up to 100,000 people in Moscow.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bookshops at the Novospassky Bridge in the 17th century, by Apollinary Vasnetsov\nBy 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called *val* (\"ramparts\").\nBetween 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813, following the destruction of much of the city during the French occupation, a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-centre. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time was the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury, the Moscow University, the Moscow Manege (Riding School), and the Bolshoi Theatre. In 1903 the Moskvoretskaya water supply was completed.\n\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – \"raskats\". The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto.\n\n\nThe road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road, which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as *Peterburskoye Schosse* after it was paved in the 1780s. Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov.\n\n\n\n![](image)Napoleon retreating from the city during the Fire of Moscow, after the failed French Invasion of Russia\nWhen Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected that the Moscow fire was principally the effect of Russian sabotage. Napoleon's *Grande Armée* was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 of Napoleon's soldiers died during this time.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral Square during the coronation of Alexander I, 1802, by Fyodor Alekseyev\nMoscow State University was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by Domenico Giliardi. The *Moskovskiye Vedomosti* newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.\n\n\nThe Arbat Street had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, general Alexander Bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. Khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day Belorussky Rail Terminal) was inaugurated in 1870. Sokolniki Park, in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban Savyolovsky Rail Terminal was built in 1902. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow's first official mayor.\n\n\nWhen Catherine II came to power in 1762, the city's filth and the smell of sewage were depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly lifestyles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.[45]\n\n\n\n### Soviet period (1917–1991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City plan of Moscow, 1917\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Song from the Soviet film |\n\n\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising happening in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks also began their uprising. On November 2 (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow.[46]\n\n\nThen Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) back to Moscow on March 12, 1918.[47] The Kremlin once again became the seat of power and the political centre of the new state.\n\n\nWith the change in values imposed by communist ideology, the tradition of preservation of cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with the collectivization of peasants; the destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 several letters were written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to rename Moscow to \"Stalindar\" or \"Stalinodar,\" one from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to \"live in Stalinodar\" and had selected the name to represent the \"gift\" (dar) of the genius of Stalin.[48] Stalin rejected this suggestion, and after it was suggested again to him by Nikolai Yezhov, he was outraged, saying \"What do I need this for?\". This was following Stalin banning the renaming of places in his name in 1936.[49]\n\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviet State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the Red Army were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people), and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. Between October 1941 and January 1942, the German Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the Battle of Moscow. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944, a medal \"For the defence of Moscow\" and in 1947 another medal \"In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow\" was instituted.\n\n\nBoth German and Soviet casualties during the Battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between September 30, 1941, and January 7, 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the Wehrmacht and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Funeral procession at the funeral of Joseph Stalin, 1953\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Stalins USSR in 1953 |\n\n\nDuring the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of high-rise apartments. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing the majority of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.[53] Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film *Irony of Fate* parodies this construction method.\n\n\nThe city of Zelenograd was built in 1958 at 37 kilometres (23 miles) from the city centre to the north-west, along with the Leningradskoye Shosse, and incorporated as one of Moscow's administrative okrugs. Moscow State University moved to its campus on Sparrow Hills in 1953.\n\n\nIn 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soviet parade outside Hotel Moskva on the Manezhnaya Square, 1964\nOn May 8, 1965, due to the actual 20th anniversary of the victory in World War II, Moscow was awarded a title of the Hero City.\n\n\n\n![](image)Victory Day celebration on Red Square, May 9, 1975\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109 kilometres (68 miles) along the city borders. The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated. In 1980, Moscow hosted the Summer Olympic Games, which were boycotted by the United States and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan in late 1979. In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservative communists opposed to the liberal reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\n\n\n### Recent history (1991–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Floating bridge in Zaryadye Park, with the Red Square and the Moscow Kremlin in the distance\n![](image)Tverskaya Street, the main radial street in the city\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian SFSR (on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation). Since then, a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\n\nThe city has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.\n\n\nIn December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The Third Ring Road, intermediate between the early 19th-century Garden Ring and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.[54] Multiple old churches and other examples of architectural heritage that had been demolished during the Stalin era have been restored, such as the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.\nIn 2010s Moscow's Administration has launched some long duration projects like the *Moja Ulitsa* (in English: *My Street*) urban redevelopment program[55] or the Residency renovation one.[56]\n\n\nBy its territorial expansion on July 1, 2012, southwest into the Moscow Oblast the area of the capital more than doubled, going from 1,091 to 2,511 square kilometers (421 to 970 sq mi), resulting in Moscow becoming the largest city on the European continent by area; it also gained an additional population of 233,000 people.[57][58] The annexed territory was officially named *Новая Москва* (New Moscow).\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Moscow and its nearby suburbs\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone. 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits. The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 metres (512 feet). Teplostan Upland is the city's highest point at 255 metres (837 feet).[59] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is 39.7 km (24.7 mi), and the length from north to south is 51.8 km (32.2 mi).\n\n\n\n### Time[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Time\n\nMoscow serves as the reference point for the time zone used in most of European Russia, Belarus and the Republic of Crimea. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as *Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК)*, which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3. Daylight saving time is no longer observed. According to the geographical longitude the average solar noon in Moscow occurs at 12:30.[60]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Moscow\n\n![](image)VDNKh after rain\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dfb*) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers. More extreme continental climates at the same latitude- such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia- have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea. Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from −25 °C (−13 °F) in the city and −30 °C (−22 °F) in the suburbs to above 5 °C (41 °F) in the winter, and from 10 to 35 °C (50 to 95 °F) in the summer.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Petrovsky Palace on Leningradsky Avenue in winter\nTypical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July, and August are around a comfortable 20 to 26 °C (68 to 79 °F), but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed 30 °C (86 °F), sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, average temperatures normally drop to approximately −10 °C (14 °F), though almost every winter there are periods of warmth with day temperatures rising above 0 °C (32 °F), and periods of cooling with night temperatures falling below −20 °C (−4 °F). These periods usually last about a week or two. The growing season in Moscow normally lasts for 156 days usually around May 1 to October 5.[62]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F)[63] at the VVC weather station and 39.0 °C (102.2 °F) in the center of Moscow and Domodedovo airport on July 29, 2010, during the unusual 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves. Record high and average temperatures were recorded for January, March, April, May, June, July, August, November, and December in 2007–2022.[64] The average July temperature from 1991 to 2020 is 19.7 °C (67.5 °F). The lowest ever recorded temperature was −42.1 °C (−43.8 °F) in January 1940. Snow, which is present for about five months a year, often begins to fall mid-October, while snow cover lies in November and melts at the beginning of April.\n\n\nOn average, Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying from a low of 8% in December to 52% from May to August.[65] This large annual variation is due to convective cloud formation. In the winter, moist air from the Atlantic condenses in the cold continental interior, resulting in very overcast conditions. However, this same continental influence results in considerably sunnier summers than oceanic cities of similar latitude such as Edinburgh. Between 2004 and 2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months, up to a record 411 hours in July 2014, 79% of possible sunshine. December 2017 was the darkest month in Moscow since records began, with only six minutes of sunlight.[66][67]\n\n\nTemperatures in the centre of Moscow are often significantly higher than in the outskirts and nearby suburbs, especially in winter. For example, if the average February temperature in the north-east of Moscow is −6.7 °C (19.9 °F), in the suburbs it is about −9 °C (16 °F).[68] The temperature difference between the centre of Moscow and nearby areas of Moscow Oblast can sometimes be more than 10 °C (18 °F) on frosty winter nights.\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1991–2020, records 1879–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 28.9(84.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −3.9(25.0)\n | −3(27)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −6.2(20.8)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −8.7(16.3)\n | −8.8(16.2)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | 2.6(36.7)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n | −38.2(−36.8)\n | −32.4(−26.3)\n | −21(−6)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −20.3(−4.5)\n | −32.8(−27.0)\n | −38.8(−37.8)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 44(1.7)\n | 39(1.5)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 61(2.4)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 84(3.3)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 66(2.6)\n | 70(2.8)\n | 52(2.0)\n | 51(2.0)\n | 713(28.1)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth cm (inches)\n | 24(9.4)\n | 35(14)\n | 29(11)\n | 2(0.8)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 12(4.7)\n | 35(14)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 8\n | 6\n | 9\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 17\n | 13\n | 8\n | 155\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 25\n | 23\n | 15\n | 6\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.3\n | 5\n | 17\n | 24\n | 116\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 85\n | 81\n | 74\n | 68\n | 67\n | 72\n | 74\n | 78\n | 82\n | 83\n | 86\n | 86\n | 78\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 33\n | 72\n | 128\n | 170\n | 265\n | 279\n | 271\n | 238\n | 147\n | 78\n | 32\n | 18\n | 1,731\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 14\n | 27\n | 35\n | 40\n | 53\n | 53\n | 52\n | 51\n | 38\n | 24\n | 13\n | 8\n | 34\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Pogoda.ru.net,[69][70] Thermograph.ru,[71] Meteoweb.ru (sunshine hours)[72] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[73] |\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1961–1990\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −6.3(20.7)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 1.1(34.0)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −11.1(12.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 7.1(44.8)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n |\n| Source: [74][75][76][77] |\n\nRecent changes in Moscow's regional climate, since it is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, are often cited by climate scientists as evidence of global warming[*citation needed*], though by definition, climate change is global, not regional. During the summer, extreme heat is often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2021). Along with a southern part of Central Russia,[78][79] after recent years of hot summer seasons, the climate of the city gets hot-summer classification trends. Winter also became significantly milder: for example, the average January temperature in the early 1900s was −12.0 °C (10.4 °F), while now it is about −7.0 °C (19.4 °F).[80] At the end of January–February it is often colder, with frosts reaching −30.0 °C (−22.0 °F) a few nights per year (2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013).\n\n\nThe last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow.

According to Russia's Federal Migration Service, Moscow holds 1.8 million official \"guests\" who have temporary residency on the basis of visas or other documentation, giving a legal population of 14.8 million. The number of Illegal immigrants, the vast majority originating from Central Asia, is estimated to be an additional 1 million people,[92] giving a total population of about 15.8 million.\n\n\n**Vital statistics for 2022:**[93][94]\n\n\n\n* Births: 123,654 (9.8 per 1,000)\n* Deaths: 126,988 (10.1 per 1,000)\n\n\n**Total fertility rate (2022):**[95]   \n\n1.42 children per woman\n\n\n**Life expectancy (2021):**[96]   \n\nTotal — 74.55 years (male — 71.00, female — 77.94)\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in Moscow (2020)[97][98] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Russian Orthodoxy |  | 55% |\n| Atheism and irreligion |  | 28% |\n| Islam |  | 8% |\n| Other religions |  | 3% |\n| Other Christians |  | 2% |\n| Undeclared |  | 4% |\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from left**: the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, demolished during the Soviet period and reconstructed from 1990–2000; Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception; Moscow Cathedral Mosque; and Moscow Choral Synagogue\n\nChristians form the majority of the city's population; most of whom adhere Russian Orthodox Church. The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery. Moscow was called the \"city of 40 times 40 churches\"—prior to 1917. Moscow is Russia's capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has been the country's traditional religion.\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Moscow include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Yazidism, and Rodnovery. The Moscow Mufti Council claimed that Muslims numbered around 1.5 million of 10.5 million of the city's population in 2010;[99] There are four mosques in the city.[100]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Moscow\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, a masterpiece of Russian architecture\n![](image)The State Historical Museum, an example of the Neo-Russian style\n![](image)The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, an example of Neo-Byzantine architecture\nMoscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is the site of Saint Basil's Cathedral, with its elegant onion domes, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.\n\n\nMedieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.\n\n\nThe Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.\n\n\nThe city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated by constant fires and the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.[101]\n\n\nFor much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of Joseph Stalin's large-scale effort to \"modernize\" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's demolitions was the Sukharev Tower, a longtime city landmark, as well as mansions and commercial buildings. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the Kazan Cathedral and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)GUM department store, facing the Red Square\n![](image)Ostankino Tower, the tallest freestanding structure in Europe, and the eighth-tallest in the world\nWhile the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with VKHUTEMAS, responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was Vladimir Shukhov, famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.[103] Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the GUM department store on Red Square,[103] bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the Seven Sisters, Hotel Ukraina, is the tallest hotel in Europe, and one of the tallest hotels in the world.\n![](image)Zhivopisny Bridge, the highest cable-stayed bridge in Europe\nPerhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called Seven Sisters, seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York City, and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as Stalinist Gothic architecture. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the Ostankino Tower, which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the CN Tower in Toronto.[104]\n\n\nThe Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.\n\n\nAlthough the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall, and have elevators. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as Chicago. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.[105]\n\n\nStalinist-era buildings, mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with Socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes. However, small churches—almost always Eastern Orthodox– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old Arbat Street, a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist façades of Tverskaya Street, for example) are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of Tsarist times. Ostankino Palace, Kuskovo, Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some convents, and monasteries, both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.\n\n\n\n![](image)Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious MIBC.\nAttempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet avant-garde work too, such as the house of the architect Konstantin Melnikov in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. Facadism is also widely practiced.[106] Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-Modernist styles employed, such as with the Novy Arbat project, familiarly known as \"false teeth of Moscow\" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.\n\n\n\n![](image)Borovitskaya square, Monument to Vladimir the Great and Pashkov House\nPlaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many \"museum houses\" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.\n\n\nMoscow's skyline is quickly modernizing, with several new towers under construction.\nIn recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed in the past few years[107] to make space for luxury apartments and hotels.[108] Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years, more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century.[109] Some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov[110] and Mayakovskaya metro station.\n\n\nSome organizations, such as Moscow Architecture Preservation Society[111] and Save Europe's Heritage,[112] are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Panoramic view of Moscow\n | Panoramic view of Moscow\n |\n\n\n### Parks and landmarks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Moscow tourist attractions\n\n![](image)\nRed Square is a World Heritage Site.\n\nThere are 96 parks and 18 gardens in Moscow, including four botanical gardens. There are 450 square kilometres (170 sq mi) of green zones besides 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) of forests.[114] Moscow is a very green city, if compared to other cities of comparable size in Western Europe and North America; this is partly due to a history of having green \"yards\" with trees and grass, between residential buildings. There are on average 27 square meters (290 sq ft) of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for Paris, 7.5 in London and 8.6 in New York.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gorky Park\nGorky Park (officially the Central Park of Culture and Rest named after Maxim Gorky), was founded in 1928. The main part (689,000 square metres or 170 acres)[115] along the Moskva river contains estrades, children's attractions (including the *Observation Wheel* water ponds with boats and water bicycles), dancing, tennis courts and other sports facilities. It borders the Neskuchny Garden (408,000 square metres or 101 acres), the oldest park in Moscow and a former imperial residence, created as a result of the integration of three estates in the 18th century. The Garden features the Green Theater, one of the largest open amphitheaters in Europe, able to hold up to 15 thousand people.[116] Several parks include a section known as a \"Park of Culture and Rest\", sometimes alongside a much wilder area (this includes parks such as Izmaylovsky, Fili and Sokolniki). Some parks are designated as Forest Parks (lesopark).\n\n\n\n![](image)Dream Island, the largest indoor theme park in Europe\nIzmaylovsky Park, created in 1931, is one of the largest urban parks in the world along with Richmond Park in London. Its area of 15.34 square kilometres (5.92 sq mi) is six times greater than that of Central Park in New York.[115]\n\n\nBauman Garden, officially founded in 1920 and renamed in 1922 after the bolshevik Nikolay Bauman, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow. It is standing on the site of the former Golitsyn estate and eighteenth-century public garden.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Novodevichy Convent is a World Heritage Site. Sokolniki Park, named after the falcon hunting that occurred there in the past, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow and has an area of 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). A central circle with a large fountain is surrounded by birch, maple, and elm tree alleys. A labyrinth composed of green paths lies beyond the park's ponds.\n\n\nLosiny Ostrov National Park (\"Elk Island\" National Park), with a total area of more than 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), borders Sokolniki Park and was Russia's first national park. It is quite wild, and is also known as the \"city taiga\" – elk can be seen there.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye is a World Heritage Site.\nTsytsin Main Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences, founded in 1945 is the largest in Europe.[118] It covers the territory of 3.61 square kilometres (1.39 sq mi) bordering the All-Russia Exhibition Center and contains a live exhibition of more than 20 thousand species of plants from around the world, as well as a lab for scientific research. It contains a rosarium with 20 thousand rose bushes, a dendrarium, and an oak forest, with the average age of trees exceeding 100 years. There is a greenhouse taking up more than 5,000 square metres (53,820 square feet) of land.[115]\n\n\nThe All-Russian Exhibition Center (Всероссийский выставочный центр), formerly known as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) and later Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), though officially named a \"permanent trade show\", is one of the most prominent examples of Stalinist-era monumental architecture. Among the large spans of a recreational park, areas are scores of elaborate pavilions, each representing either a branch of Soviet industry and science or a USSR republic. Even though during the 1990s it was, and for some part still is, misused as a gigantic shopping center (most of the pavilions are rented out for small businesses), it still retains the bulk of its architectural landmarks, including two monumental fountains (*Stone Flower* and *Friendship of Nations*) and a 360 degrees panoramic cinema. In 2014 the park returned to the name Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, and in the same year, huge renovation works had been started.[119]\n\n\n*Lilac Park*, founded in 1958, has a permanent sculpture display and a large rosarium. Moscow has always been a popular destination for tourists. Some of the more famous attractions include the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, Moscow Kremlin and Red Square,[120] which was built between the 14th and 17th centuries.[121] The Church of the Ascension at Kolomenskoye, which dates from 1532, is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and another popular attraction.[122]\n\n\nNear the new Tretyakov Gallery there is a sculpture garden, Museon, often called \"the graveyard of fallen monuments\" that displays statues of the former Soviet Union that were removed from their place after its dissolution.\n\n\nOther attractions include the Moscow Zoo, a zoological garden in two sections (the valleys of two streams) linked by a bridge, with nearly a thousand species and more than 6,500 specimens.[123] Each year, the zoo attracts more than 1.2 million visitors.[123] Many of Moscow's parks and landscaped gardens are protected natural environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Zaryadye Park | VDNKh | Victory park on Poklonnaya Hill |\n\n\n## Moscow rings[edit]\n\n\nMoscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads (\"rings\").\n\n\n\n1. The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso (Boulevard Ring), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called Bely Gorod (White Town).[124] The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a horseshoe-shaped arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the Yauza River.\n2. The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso (Garden Ring). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.[124] ![](image)Moscow as viewed from the International Space Station, January 29, 2014\n3. The Third Ring Road, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed freeway.\n4. The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, was planned, but cancelled in 2011. A system of chordal highways will replace it.\n\n\nAside from the aforementioned hierarchy, line 5 of Moscow Metro is a circle-shaped looped subway line (hence the name *Koltsevaya Liniya*, literally \"ring line\"), which is located between the *Sadovoye Koltso* and Third Transport Ring.\n\n\nTwo modern overlapping lines of Moscow Metro form \"two hearts\":\n\n\n\n* Line 14. Since September 10, 2016, *Moscow Central Circle* renovated railroad (former *Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga*) was introduced as Line 14 of Moscow Metro. The cone-shaped railroad initially opened in 1908 (freight-only railway from 1934 until the 2016 reopening).\n* Line 11. Another circle metro line - *Big Circle Line* (*Bolshaya Koltsevaya Liniya*) is under construction and will be finished in 2023. Kakhovskaya-Savyolovskaya western half of the line was launched in late 2021.\n\n\nThe outermost ring within Moscow is the Moscow Ring Road (often called *MKAD*, acronym word for Russian *Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога*), which forms the cultural boundary of the city, and was established in the 1950s. It is to note the method of building the road (usage of ground elevation instead of concrete columns throughout the whole way) formed a wall-like barrier that obstacles building roads under the MKAD highway itself).\n\n\n\n* Before 2012 expansion of Moscow, MKAD was considered an approximate border for Moscow boundaries.\n\n\nOutside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits, with the notable examples of *Betonka* roads (highways A107 and A108), originally made of concrete pads.\n\n\nIn order to reduce transit traffic on MKAD, the new ring road (called *CKAD* - *Centralnaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga*, *Central Ring Road*) is now under construction beyond the MKAD.\n\n\n\n### Transport rings in Moscow[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Length\n | Name\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 km | Boulevard Ring – Bulvarnoye Koltso (not a full ring) | Road\n |\n| 16 km | Garden Ring – Sadovoye Koltso (\"B\") | Road\n |\n| 19 km | Koltsevaya line (Line 5) | Metro\n |\n| 35 km | Third Ring Road – Third Transport Ring – Tretye Transportnoye Koltso (TTK) | Road\n |\n| 54 km | Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, re-opened as Moscow Central Ring (MCC) – Line 14 | Railway\n |\n| 20.2 km | Bolshaya Koltsevaya line – Line 11 | Metro\n |\n| 109 km | Moscow Automobile Ring Road – Moskovskaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga (MKAD) | Road\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums and galleries[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.[125] The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the Tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition.[126] The works of famous pre-Revolutionary painters, such as Ilya Repin, as well as the works of early Russian icon painters can be found here. Visitors can even see rare originals by early 15th-century iconographer Andrei Rublev.[126]\nThe New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of Vladimir Tatlin's famous *Monument to the Third International* and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts\nAnother art museum in the city of Moscow is the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which was founded by, among others, the father of Marina Tsvetaeva. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the British Museum in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts paintings from every major Western era; works by Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso are present in the museum's collection.\n\n\nThe State Historical Museum of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers is several million. The Polytechnical Museum,[127] founded in 1872 is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata from the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items.[128] The Borodino Panorama[129] museum located on Kutuzov Avenue provides an opportunity for visitors to experience being on a battlefield with a 360° diorama. It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon's army, that includes also the triumphal arch, erected in 1827. There is also a military history museum that includes statues, and military hardware.\nMemorial Museum of Cosmonautics under the Monument to the Conquerors of Space at the end of Cosmonauts Alley is the central memorial place for the Russian space officials.\n\n\nThe Shchusev State Museum of Architecture is the national museum of Russian architecture by the name of the architect Alexey Shchusev near the Kremlin area.\n\n\nMoscow will get its own branch of the Hermitage Museum in 2024, with authorities having agreed upon the final project, to be executed by Hani Rashid, co-founder of New York-based 'Asymptote Architecture' - the same bureau that's behind the city's stock market building, the Busan-based World Business Center Solomon Tower and the Strata Tower in Abu-Dhabi.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Bolshoi Theatre\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMoscow is the heart of the Russian performing arts, including ballet and film, with 68 museums[131] 103[132] theaters, 132 cinemas and 24 concert halls. Among Moscow's theaters and ballet studios is the Bolshoi Theatre and the Malyi Theatre[133] as well as Vakhtangov Theatre and Moscow Art Theatre.\n\n\nThe Moscow International Performance Arts Center,[134] opened in 2003, also known as Moscow International House of Music, is known for its performances in classical music. It has the largest organ in Russia installed in Svetlanov Hall.\n\n\nThere are also two large circuses in Moscow: Moscow State Circus and Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard[135] named after Yuri Nikulin.\n\n\nThe Mosfilm studio was at the heart of many classic films, as it is responsible for both artistic and mainstream productions.[136] However, despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally renowned Russian filmmakers, the once prolific native studios are much quieter. Rare and historical films may be seen in the Salut cinema, where films from the Museum of Cinema[137] collection are shown regularly. International film festivals such as the Moscow International Film Festival, Stalker, Artdocfest, and Moscow Jewish Film Festival are staged in Moscow.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Moscow\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.\n![](image)Sparrow Hills fanzone during 2018 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)SC Olimpiyskiy was built for the 1980 Summer Olympics.\nOver 500 Olympic sports champions lived in the city by 2005.[138] Moscow is home to 63 stadiums (besides eight football and eleven light athletics maneges), of which Luzhniki Stadium is the largest and the 4th biggest in Europe (it hosted the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, 2007–08 UEFA Champions League finals, the 1980 Summer Olympics, and the 2018 FIFA World Cup with 7 games total, including the final). Forty other sports complexes are located within the city, including 24 with artificial ice. The Olympic Stadium was the world's first indoor arena for bandy and hosted the Bandy World Championship twice.[139] Moscow was again the host of the competition in 2010, this time in Krylatskoye.[140] That arena has also hosted the World Speed Skating Championships. There are also seven horse racing tracks in Moscow,[114] of which Central Moscow Hippodrome,[141] founded in 1834, is the largest.\n\n\n\n![](image)CSKA Arena during a game of KHL, considered to be the second-best ice hockey league in the world\nMoscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, with the yachting events being held at Tallinn, in present-day Estonia. Large sports facilities and the main international airport, Sheremetyevo Terminal 2, were built in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow had made a bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, when final voting commenced on July 6, 2005, Moscow was the first city to be eliminated from further rounds. The Games were awarded to London.\n\n\nThe most titled ice hockey team in the Soviet Union and in the world, HC CSKA Moscow comes from Moscow. Other big ice hockey clubs from Moscow are HC Dynamo Moscow, which was the second most titled team in the Soviet Union, and HC Spartak Moscow.\n\n\nThe most titled Soviet, Russian, and one of the most titled Euroleague clubs, is the basketball club from Moscow PBC CSKA Moscow. Moscow hosted the EuroBasket in 1953 and 1965.\n\n\nMoscow had more winners at the USSR and Russian Chess Championship than any other city.\n\n\nThe most titled volleyball team in the Soviet Union and in Europe (CEV Champions League) is VC CSKA Moscow.\n\n\nIn football, FC Spartak Moscow has won more championship titles in the Russian Premier League than any other team. They were second only to FC Dynamo Kyiv in Soviet times. PFC CSKA Moscow became the first Russian football team to win a UEFA title, the UEFA Cup (present-day UEFA Europa League). FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Dynamo Moscow and FC Torpedo Moscow are other professional football teams also based in Moscow.\n\n\n\n* ![Otkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow](image)\n\nOtkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow\n* ![VEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow](image)\n\nVEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow\n* ![VTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow](image)\n\nVTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow\n* ![RZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow](image)\n\nRZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow\n\n\nMoscow houses other prominent football, ice hockey, and basketball teams. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were once highly centralized, two of the best Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces (CSKA) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo). There were army and police teams in most major cities. As a result, Spartak, CSKA, and Dinamo were among the best-funded teams in the USSR.\n\n\nThe Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace is located in the Luzniki Olympic Complex. The building works started in 2017 and the opening ceremony took place on June 18, 2019. The investor of the Palace is the billionaire Alisher Usmanov, husband of the former gymnast and gymnastics coach Irina Viner-Usmanova. The total surface of the building is 23,500 m2, which include 3 fitness rooms, locker rooms, rooms reserved for referees and coaches, saunas, a canteen, a cafeteria, 2 ball halls, a Medical center, a hall reserved for journalists, and a hotel for athletes.[142]\n\n\nBecause of Moscow's cold local climate, winter sports have a following. Many of Moscow's large parks offer marked trails for skiing and frozen ponds for skating.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, which hosted games of the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nMoscow hosts the annual Kremlin Cup, a popular tennis tournament on both the WTA and ATP tours. It is one of the ten Tier-I events on the women's tour and a host of Russian players feature every year.\n\n\nSC Olimpiyskiy hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, the first and so far the only Eurovision Song Contest arranged in Russia.\n\n\nSlava Moscow is a professional rugby club, competing in the national Professional Rugby League. Former rugby league heavyweights RC Lokomotiv have entered the same league as of 2011[update]. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\n\n\nIn bandy, one of the most successful clubs in the world is 20 times Russian League champions Dynamo Moscow. They have also won the World Cup thrice and European Cup six times.\n\n\nMFK Dinamo Moskva is one of the major futsal clubs in Europe, having won the Futsal Champions League title once.\n\n\nWhen Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Luzhniki Stadium got an increased capacity, by almost 10,000 new seats, in addition to a further two stadiums that have been built: the Dynamo Stadium, and the Spartak Stadium, although the first one later was dismissed from having World Cup matches.\n\n\n\n### Football clubs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Club | Founded | League | League Rank | Stadium\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spartak Moscow | 1922 | Premier League | 1st | Otkrytiye Arena |\n| CSKA Moscow | 1911 | Premier League | 1st | VEB Arena |\n| Lokomotiv Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | RZD Arena |\n| Dynamo Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | VTB Arena |\n| Torpedo Moscow | 1924 | First League | 2nd | Eduard Streltsov Stadium |\n| Rodina Moscow | 2015 | First League | 2nd | Spartakovets Stadium\n |\n| Veles Moscow | 2016 | Second League | 3rd | Avangard Stadium\n |\n\n\n## Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of shopping malls in Moscow\n\n![](image)Arbat Street, in the historical centre of Moscow\nThe city is full of clubs, restaurants, and bars. Tverskaya Street is also one of the busiest shopping streets in Moscow.\n\n\nThe adjoining Tretyakovsky Proyezd, also south of Tverskaya Street, in Kitai-gorod, is host to upmarket boutique stores such as Bulgari, Tiffany & Co., Armani, Prada and Bentley.[143] Nightlife in Moscow has moved on since Soviet times and today the city has many of the world's largest nightclubs.[144] Clubs, bars, creative spaces and restaurants-turned-into-dancefloors are flooding Moscow streets with new openings every year. The hottest area is located around the old chocolate factory, where bars, nightclubs, galleries, cafés and restaurants are placed.[145]\n\n\nDream Island is an amusement park in Moscow that opened on February 29, 2020.[146][147] It is the largest indoor theme park in Europe.\nThe park covers 300,000 square meters. During the park's construction, 150 acres of nature trees unique and rare animals and birds and plants on the peninsula were destroyed. The appearance is in the style of a fairytale castle similar to Disneyland. The park has 29 unique attractions with many rides, as well as pedestrian malls with fountains and cycle paths. The complex includes a landscaped park along with a concert hall, a cinema, a hotel, a children's sailing school, restaurants, and shops.\n\n\n\n## Authorities[edit]\n\n\n### Moscow authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Government of Moscow, Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Duma, and Charter of the city of Moscow\n\n![](image)Government of Moscow\nAccording to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Moscow is an independent federal subject of the Russian Federation, the so-called city of federal importance.\n\n\nThe Mayor of Moscow is the leading official in the executive, leading the Government of Moscow, which is the highest organ of executive power.\nThe Moscow City Duma is the City Duma (city council or local parliament) and local laws must be approved by it. It includes 45 members who are elected for a five-year term on Single-mandate constituency basis.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, direct elections of the mayor were not held due to changes in the Charter of the city of Moscow, the mayor was appointed by presidential decree. The first direct elections from the time of the 2003 vote were to be held after the expiration of the current mayor in 2015, however, in connection with his resignation of his own free will, they took place in September 2013.\n\n\nLocal administration is carried out through eleven prefectures, uniting the districts of Moscow into administrative districts on a territorial basis, and 125 regional administrations. According to the law \"On the organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow\", since the beginning of 2003, the executive bodies of local self-government are municipalities, representative bodies are municipal assemblies, whose members are elected in accordance with the Charter of the intracity municipality.\n\n\n\n### Federal authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: White House (Moscow) and State Duma\n\n![](image)The House of the Government of the Russian Federation\nIn Moscow, as in a city endowed with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the legislative, executive, and judicial federal authorities of the country are located, with the exception of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, which has been located in Saint Petersburg since 2008.\n\n\nThe supreme executive authority - the Government of the Russian Federation - is located in the House of the Government of the Russian Federation on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment in the center of Moscow. The State Duma sits on Okhotny Ryad. The Federation Council is located in a building on Bolshaya Dmitrovka. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation are also located in Moscow.\n\n\nIn addition, the Moscow Kremlin is the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation. The president's working residence in the Kremlin is located in the Senate Palace.\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A BMW 5 Series of the Moscow Police on patrol\nAccording to the ranking of the safest cities made by The Economist Moscow occupies the 37th position with a score of 68,5 points percent.[148] The general level of crime is quite low.[149] More than 170,000 surveillance cameras in Moscow are connected to the facial recognition system. The authorities recognized the successful two-month experiment with automatic recognition of faces, gender, and age of people in real-time - and then they deployed the system to the whole city. The network of video surveillance unites access video cameras (95% of residential apartment buildings in the capital), cameras in the territory and in buildings of schools and kindergartens, at the MCC stations, stadiums, public transport stops, and bus stations, in parks, underground passages.[150]\n\n\nThe emergency numbers are the same as in all the other regions of Russia: 112 is the Single Emergency Number, 101 is the number of the Fire Service and Ministry of Emergency Situations, 102 is the Police one, 103 is the ambulance one, 104 is the Emergency Gas number.[151] Moscow's EMS is the second most efficient one among the world's megacities, as reported by PwC during the presentation of the international study Analysis of EMS Efficiency in Megacities of the World.[152]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Moscow\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Federal city of Moscow\n | ![Coat of arms of Moscow](image) |\n| **City administrative divisions** | 12\n |\n| **City districts** | 125\n |\n| **City settlements** | 21\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Moscow is divided into **12 administrative districts**:\n | ![](image) |\n| 1.

Troitsky Administrative Okrug\n |\n\n\n![](image)Territorial change of Moscow from 1922 to 1995\nThe entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor (Sergey Sobyanin). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125 districts.\n\n\nThe Russian capital's town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.\n\n\nThe following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the MKAD, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of Zelenograd. A part of Moscow Oblast's territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer fully surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now also has a border with Kaluga Oblast.[153] In all, Moscow gained about 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq mi) and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a \"mega-city\" of twenty million people, to develop \"harmonically\".[57]\n\n\nAll administrative okrugs and districts have their own coats of arms and flags as well as individual heads of the area.\n\n\nIn addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Chinatowns that exist in some North American and East Asian cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.[154]\n\n\nMoscow also hosts some of the government bodies of Moscow Oblast, although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.[155]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Russia\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Largest private companies basedin Moscow** (ranked by 2019 revenues) |\n| **Moscow** |  | **corporation** |  | **Russia** |\n| 1 |  | Lukoil |  | 1\n |\n| 2 |  | X5 Retail Group |  | 3\n |\n| 3 |  | Novatek |  | 6\n |\n| 4 |  | Nornickel |  | 9\n |\n| 5 |  | UC Rusal |  | 11\n |\n| 6 |  | Sibur |  | 13\n |\n| 7 |  | SUEK |  | 15\n |\n| 8 |  | MTS |  | 17\n |\n| 9 |  | Metalloinvest |  | 18\n |\n| 10 |  | EuroChem |  | 21\n |\n| 11 |  | MegaFon |  | 22\n |\n| 12 |  | M.video |  | 24\n |\n| 13 |  | TMK |  | 25\n |\n| 14 |  | Mechel |  | 26\n |\n| **Source:** *Forbes*[156] |\n\n\n![](image)Moscow International Business Center, one of the largest financial centres of Europe and the world\nMoscow has one of the largest municipal economies in Europe and it accounts more than one-fifth of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP).[157] As of 2021[update], the GRP of Moscow reached almost ₽24.5 trillion(US$332 billion).[158] GMP of Moscow Region was ₽31.3 trillion or around US$425 billion.\n\n\n\n![](image)Moscow Exchange\nThe average gross monthly wage in the city is ₽123,688[159] (US$2,000), which is around twice the national average of ₽66,572 (US$1,000), and one of the highest among the federal subjects of Russia.\n\n\nMoscow is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[160] and has the highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe. It is the financial center of Russia and home to the country's largest banks and many of its largest companies, such as oil giant Rosneft. Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country.[161][162] Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use. Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption still hinder business development.\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nPrimary industries in Moscow include the chemical, metallurgy, food, textile, furniture, energy production, software development and machinery industries.\n\n\nThe Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant is one of the world's leading producers of military and civil helicopters. Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center produces various space equipment, including modules for space stations Mir, Salyut and the ISS as well as Proton launch vehicles and military ICBMs. Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Tupolev and Yakovlev aircraft design bureaus also situated in Moscow. NPO Energomash, producing the rocket engines for Russian and American space programs, as well as Lavochkin design bureau, which built fighter planes during WWII, but switched to space probes since the Space Race, are in nearby Khimki, an independent city in Moscow Oblast that have largely been enclosed by Moscow from its sides. Automobile plants ZiL and AZLK, as well as the Voitovich Rail Vehicle plant, are situated in Moscow and Metrovagonmash metro wagon plant is located just outside the city limits. The Poljot Moscow watch factory produces military, professional and sport watches well known in Russia and abroad. Yuri Gagarin in his trip into space used \"Shturmanskie\" produced by this factory.\n\n\nThe Electrozavod factory was the first transformer factory in Russia. The Kristall distillery[163] is the oldest distillery in Russia producing vodka types, including \"Stolichnaya\" while wines are produced at Moscow wine plants, including the Moscow Interrepublican Vinery.[164] The Moscow Jewelry Factory[165] and the Jewellerprom[166] are producers of jewelry in Russia; Jewellerprom used to produce the exclusive Order of Victory, awarded to those aiding the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II.\n\n\nThere are other industries located just outside the city of Moscow, as well as microelectronic industries in Zelenograd, including Ruselectronics companies.\n\n\nGazprom, the largest extractor of natural gas in the world and the largest Russian company, has head offices also in Moscow, as well as other oil, gas, and electricity companies.\n\n\nMoscow hosts headquarters of the many of telecommunication and technology companies, including 1C, ABBYY, Beeline, Kaspersky Lab, Mail.Ru Group, MegaFon, MTS, Rambler&Co, Rostelecom, Yandex, and Yota.\n\n\nSome industry is being transferred out of the city to improve the ecological state of the city.\n\n\n\n### Cost of living[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hotels in Moscow\n\n![](image)Tretyakovsky Proyezd\n![](image)Nikolskaya Street\n![](image)A microdistrict in Mitino built in the 1990s\nDuring Soviet times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes, and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s when people were permitted to secure property rights to their inhabited places. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.\n\n\nThe price of real estate in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $4,000 on average per square meter (11 sq ft) on the outskirts of the city[167] or US$6,500–$8,000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed US$40,000 per square meter in a flat.[168][169][170] It costs about US$1,200 per month to rent a one-bedroom apartment and about US$1,000 per month for a studio in the center of Moscow.\n\n\nA typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square metres (320 square feet), a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square metres (480 square feet), and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square metres (750 square feet). Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in dachas (country houses) outside the city.\n\n\nIn 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's most expensive city for expatriate employees, ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, due to the stable Russian ruble as well as increasing housing prices within the city.[171] Moscow also ranked first in the 2007 edition and 2008 edition of the survey. However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the most expensive city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place.[172]\n\n\nIn 2008, Moscow ranked top on the list of most expensive cities for the third year in a row.[173]\n\n\nIn 2014, according to *Forbes*, Moscow was ranked the 9th most expensive city in the world. *Forbes* ranked Moscow the 2nd most expensive city the year prior.[174]\n\n\nIn 2019 the Economist Intelligence Unit's Worldwide Cost of Living survey put Moscow to 102nd place in the biannual ranking of 133 most expensive cities.[175] ECA International's Cost of Living 2019 Survey ranked Moscow at number 120 among 482 locations worldwide.[176]\n\n\n\n### Public utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Heating[edit]\n\n\nThe heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using central heating system. Before 2004, state unitary enterprises were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the heating substations in the north-eastern part of the city. Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location. A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier. Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies. The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it. One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) (Russian: Московская теплосетевая компания). In 2007 the Government of Moscow bought controlling stakes in the company.[177]\n\n\n\n#### City services[edit]\n\n\n\"Our city\" is a geo-information portal created in 2011 under the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin with the aim of building a constructive dialogue between Moscow residents and the city's executive authorities. The portal is being developed by the State Public Institution \"New Management Technologies\" together with the Moscow Department of Information Technologies. In its 10 years of operation, more than 1.7 million users have joined the portal, and during this time it has become an effective tool for monitoring the state of urban infrastructure.[178]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Russia\n\n![](image)Moscow State University\nThere are 1,696 high schools in Moscow, as well as 91 colleges.[114] Besides these, there are 222 institutions of higher education, including 60 state universities[114] and the Lomonosov Moscow State University, which was founded in 1755.[179] The main university building located in Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills) is 240 metres (790 ft) tall and when completed, was the tallest building on the continent.[180] The university has over 30,000 undergraduate and 7,000 postgraduate students, who have a choice of twenty-nine faculties and 450 departments for study. Additionally, approximately 10,000 high school students take courses at the university, while over two thousand researchers work. The Moscow State University library contains over nine million books, making it one of the largest libraries in all of Russia. Its acclaim throughout the international academic community has meant that over 11,000 international students have graduated from the university, with many coming to Moscow to become fluent in the Russian language.[181]\n\n\nThe I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University named after Ivan Sechenov or formerly known as Moscow Medical Academy (1stMSMU) is a medical university situated in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1785 as the faculty of the Moscow State University. It is a Russian Federal Agency for Health and Social Development. It is one of the largest medical universities in Russia and Europe. More than 9200 students are enrolled in 115 academic departments. It offers courses for post-graduate studies.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University\nThe Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (formerly known as Russian State Medical University) is a medical higher education institution in Moscow, Russia founded in 1906. It is fully accredited and recognized by Russia's Ministry of Education and Science and is currently under the authority of the Ministry of Health and Social Development. Named after Russian surgeon and pedagogue N.I. Pirogov (1810-1888), it is one of the largest medical institutions and the first university in Russia to allow women to acquire degrees.\n\n\nMoscow is one of the financial centers of the Russian Federation and CIS countries and is known for its business schools. Among them are the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; The State University of Management, and the National Research University - Higher School of Economics. They offer undergraduate degrees in management, finance, accounting, marketing, real estate, and economic theory, as well as Masters programs and MBAs. Most of them have branches in other regions of Russia and countries around the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The main building of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University\nBauman Moscow State Technical University, founded in 1830, is located in the center of Moscow and provides 18,000 undergraduate and 1,000 postgraduate students with an education in science and engineering, offering technical degrees.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Moscow Conservatory building\nThe Moscow Conservatory,[183] founded in 1866, is a prominent music school in Russia whose graduates include Sergey Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, Aram Khachaturian, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Alfred Schnittke.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Russian State Institute of Cinematography, the world's oldest  \nfilm school\nThe Gerasimov All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography, abbreviated as VGIK, is the world's oldest educational institution in Cinematography, founded by Vladimir Gardin in 1919.\nSergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Aleksey Batalov were among its most distinguished professors and Mikhail Vartanov, Sergei Parajanov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Nikita Mikhalkov, Eldar Ryazanov, Alexander Sokurov, Yuriy Norshteyn, Aleksandr Petrov, Vasily Shukshin, Konrad Wolf among graduates.\n\n\nMoscow State Institute of International Relations, founded in 1944, remains Russia's best- known school of international relations and diplomacy, with six schools focused on international relations. Approximately 4,500 students make up the university's student body and over 700,000 Russian and foreign-language books—of which 20,000 are considered rare—can be found in the library of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.[184]\n\n\nOther institutions are the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, also known as Phystech, the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, the Moscow Aviation Institute, the Moscow Motorway Institute (State Technical University), and the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has taught numerous Nobel Prize winners, including Pyotr Kapitsa, Nikolay Semyonov, Lev Landau and Alexander Prokhorov, while the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute is known for its research in nuclear physics.[185] The highest Russian military school is the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\n\n\nAlthough Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards engineering or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in business and management. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the Master of Business Administration. Student exchange programs with numerous countries, specially with the rest of Europe, have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.\n\n\n\n![](image)Russian Academy of Sciences\nMoscow is one of the largest science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the Russian Academy of Sciences are located in Moscow as well as research and applied science institutions. The Kurchatov Institute, Russia's leading research and development institution in the fields of nuclear energy, where the first nuclear reactor in Europe was built, the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems and Steklov Institute of Mathematics are all situated in Moscow.\n\n\nThere are 452 libraries in the city, including 168 for children.[114] The Russian State Library,[186] founded in 1862, is the national library of Russia. The library is home to over 275 km (171 mi) of shelves and 42 million items, including over 17 million books and serial volumes, 13 million journals, 350,000 music scores and sound records, and 150,000 maps, making it the largest library in Russia and one of the largest in the world. Items in 247 languages account for 29% of the collection.[187][188]\n\n\nThe State Public Historical Library, founded in 1863, is the largest library specialising in Russian history. Its collection contains four million items in 112 languages (including 47 languages of the former USSR), mostly on Russian and world history, heraldry, numismatics, and the history of science.[189]\n\n\nIn regard to primary and secondary education, in 2011, Clifford J. Levy of *The New York Times* wrote, \"Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades.\"[190]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Moscow\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Metro\n\n![](image)Moscow Metro route map with planned stations\n![](image)Mayakovskaya station, opened in 1938\nThe Moscow Metro system is famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers. It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man).[191]\n\n\nThe metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.[192] Soviet workers did the labour and the artwork, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunneling instead of the \"cut-and-cover\" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.[193] The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.[194]\n\n\nToday, the Moscow Metro comprises twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 203 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance, the Park Pobedy station, completed in 2003, at 84 metres (276 ft) underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is the busiest metro system in Europe, as well as one of the world's busiest metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily (300,000,000 people every month).[195] Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has plans for expanding its Metro. In 2016, the authorities launched a new circle metro railway that contributed to solving transportation issues, namely daily congestion at Koltsevaya Line.[196]\n\n\nDue to the treatment of Metro stations as possible canvas for art, characterized by the fact that workers of Moscow would get to see them every day, many Stalin-era metro stations were built in different \"custom\" designs (where each station's design would be, initially, a massive installation on a certain theme. For example, Elektrozavodskaya station was themed solely after nearby lightbulb factory and ceramic ribbed lightbulb sockets);[197] the tradition of \"Grand Designs\" and, basically, decorating metro stations as single-themed installations, was restored in late 1979.\n\n\nMore recently, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has introduced comforts ranging from WiFi and USB ports and Apple Pay — while opening new stations at a breakneck pace. Moscow's metro is one of the world's busiest, handling 2.6 billion passengers in 2019.[198]\n\n\nIn the Russian capital, there are over 21.5 thousand Wi-Fi access points, in student dormitories, in parks, cultural and sports institutions, and within the Garden Ring and the Third Transport Ring. From September 2020 to August 2021, 1,700 new access points to urban Wi-Fi were launched in Moscow.[199] The structure of the Wi-Fi network allows citizens to use the Internet without re-authorization.[200]\n\n\n\n### Monorail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Monorail\n\n![](image)Two trains of the Moscow Monorail\nThe Moscow Metro operates a short monorail line (line 13). The line connects Timiryazevskaya metro station and Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina, passing close to VDNH (and Line 6 Metro station \"V.D.N.Kh.\"). The line opened in 2004. It accepts overground interchanges, no additional fare is needed if a ride was spent at Moscow Metro within previous 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n### Bus, trolleybus and electric bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electric buses in Moscow\n\n![](image)Moscow has the largest fleet of electric buses in Europe, with 500 operating as of October 2020[update].[201]\nAs Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses (Central Bus Terminal) with a daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.[202]\n\n\nEvery major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a trolleybus route and have trolley wires over them.\n\n\nWith the total line length of almost 600 kilometres (370 miles) of a single wire, 8 depots, 104 routes, and 1740 vehicles, the Moscow trolleybus system was the largest in the world. But municipal authority, headed by Sergey Sobyanin, began to destroy the trolleybus system in Moscow in 2014 due the planned replacement of trolleybuses by electric buses. In 2018 Moscow trolleybus system has only 4 depots and dozens of kilometers of unused wires. Almost all trolleybus wires inside Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso) were cut in 2016–2017 due to the reconstruction of central streets (\"Moya Ulitsa\"). Opened on November 15, 1933, it is also the world's 6th oldest operating trolleybus system.\n\n\nIn 2018 the vehicle companies Kamaz and GAZ have won the Mosgortrans tender for delivering 200 electric buses and 62 ultra-fast charging stations to the city transport system. The manufacturers will be responsible for the quality and reliable operation of the buses and charging stations for the next 15 years. The city will be procuring only electric buses as of 2021, replacing the diesel bus fleet gradually. According to expectations, Moscow will become the leader amongst the European cities in terms of electric and gas fuel share in public transport by 2019.[203]\n\n\nAll bus stations and terminals of Moscow are now connected to free Wi-Fi. One may use it in international bus stations Salaryevo, South Gate and North Gate, and in bus terminals Varshavskaya and Orekhovo. As much as 48 hot spots were installed there.[204]\n\n\n\n### Moscow cable car[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moskva River cable car\n\n![](image)Cable cars passing across the Moskva River and the Luzhniki Stadium\nOn November 26, 2018, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony to open the cable car above the Moskva River. The cable car will connect the Luzhniki sports complex with Sparrow Hills and Kosygin Street.\n\n\nThe journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to Luzhniki Stadium will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car. The cable car will work every day from 11 a.m. till 11 p.m.\n\n\nThe cable car is 720 meters (2,360 ft) long. It was built to transport 1,600 passengers per hour in all weathers. There are 35 closed capsules designed by Porsche Design Studio to transport passengers. The booths are equipped with media screens, LED lights, hooks for bikes, skis, and snowboards. Passengers will also be able to use audio guides in English, German, Chinese and Russian.\n\n\n\n### Tram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Trams in Moscow\n\n![](image)A Vityaz-M tram passing by the Tverskaya Zastava Square\nMoscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899.[205] The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between Universitet station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino. Some routes used to connect downtown with sleep districts, like route 3.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tram map of Moscow\nThere are three tram networks in the city:\n\n\n\n* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about one kilometre (fifty chains) of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now it is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).\n* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane – Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the Universitet station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaya streets. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to a fire at the Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, and remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).\n* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant.\n\n\nIn addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nCommercial taxi services and route taxis are in widespread use. In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as Yandex.Taxi, Uber and Gett displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow.[206][207]\n\n\nRussian tech firm Yandex is testing self-driving taxis in Moscow. Yandex's fleet of around 170 driverless cars has travelled more than 14 million kilometres. Robotaxis will available through the company's Yandex.Go application in Yasenevo district.[208]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Komsomolskaya Square known as \"Three Station Square\" thanks to three ornate rail terminal situated there: Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky. Several train stations serve the city. Moscow's ten rail terminals (or *vokzals*) are:\n\n\n* Belorussky Rail Terminal\n* Kazansky Rail Terminal\n* Kiyevsky Rail Terminal\n* Kursky Rail Terminal\n* Leningradsky Rail Terminal\n* Paveletsky Rail Terminal\n* Rizhsky Rail Terminal\n* Savyolovsky Rail Terminal\n* Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal\n* Vostochny railway Terminal\n\n\n![](image)The high-speed Sapsan train links Moscow with Saint Petersburg.\nThe terminals are located close to the city center, along with the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and connect to a metro line to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.[209] There are many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are cheap, they are the preferred mode of travel for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is the western terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which traverses nearly 9,300 kilometres (5,800 mi) of Russian territory to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast.\n\n\nSuburbs and satellite cities are connected by commuter elektrichka (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to 140 km or 87 mi) large railway stations.\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the Little Ring of the Moscow Railway was converted to be used for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. A connecting railway line on the North side of the town connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Circle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Lastochka\" train on \"Luzhniki\" station (Line 14)\nThe Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as a non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's.\n\n\nThe Moscow Central Circle is a 54-kilometre-long (34 mi) urban-metro railway orbital line that encircles historical Moscow. It was built alongside Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, taking some of its tracks into itself as well. M.C.C. was opened for passenger use on September 10, 2016. MOZD is integrated as \"Line 14 of Moscow Metro\", and, while using railway-sized trains, can be perceived as \"S-train-design circle line\".\n\n\nThe line is operated by the Moscow Government owned company MKZD through the Moscow Metro, with the Federal Government owned Russian Railways selected as the operation subcontractor. The track infrastructure and most platforms are owned by Russian Railways, while MKZD owns most station buildings. However, in *S-bahn* way, Moscow unified tickets \"Ediniiy\" and \"Troika\" are accepted by MCC stations. There is one zero-fee interchange for any ticket used on Moscow Metro station less than 90 minutes before entering an MCC station (and vice versa: a passenger of MCC gets 1 free interchange to Moscow Metro within 90 minutes after entering MCC station)\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Diameters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An EG2Tv train arriving at the Moscow Belorussky railway station\n![](image)Map of the Moscow Central Diameters\nAnother system, which forms \"genuine *S-Bahn*\" as in \"suburbia-city-suburbia\"-designed railway, is the Moscow Central Diameters, a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from \"vokzals\" final stations (e.g. by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before)[210] and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.\n\n\nOut of 5 projected lines, the first 2 lines were completed and launched on 2019-11-21 (e.g. November 21, 2019).\n\n\nWhile using the same rails as \"regular\" suburban trains to vokzals, MCD trains (\"*Ivolga*\" model) got distinguishing features (shape; red cabin, different windows, lesser amount of seats; big red \"MЦΔ\" train logo).\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Intersection at Tverskaya Zastava Square\nThere are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily. Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.\n\n\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD), along with the Third Transport Ring and the canceled Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. Several other roadway systems form concentric circles around the city.\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThere are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO), Zhukovsky (ZIA), Ostafyevo (OSF).\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheremetyevo, the busiest airport in Russia, is ranked as the second-busiest airport in Europe.\nSheremetyevo International Airport is the most globally connected of Moscow's airports, handling 60% of all international flights.[211] It is also a home to all SkyTeam members, and the main hub for Aeroflot (itself a member of SkyTeam). Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo. It is a hub for S7 airlines, and most of OneWorld and Star Alliance members use Domodedovo as their international hub. Vnukovo International Airport handles flights of Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi and others. Ostafyevo International Airport caters primarily to business aviation.\n\n\nMoscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Domodedovo is the farthest at 22 km (14 mi); Vnukovo is 11 km (7 mi); Sheremetyevo is 10 km (6 mi); and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from MKAD.[211]\n\n\nThere are a number of smaller airports close to Moscow (19 in Moscow Oblast) such as Myachkovo Airport, that are intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.[212]\n\n\n\n### Water[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal or Rechnoy vokzal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes. There are three freight ports serving Moscow.\n\n\n\n### Sharing system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carsharing in Moscow\n\n![](image)As of 2020[update], Moscow has the largest fleet of carsharing vehicles in the world, with more than 30,000 cars.[213]\nMoscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government. There are several car sharing companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company. In 2018 the mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet.[214] Every day about 25,000 people use this service. In the end of the same year Moscow carsharing became the second in the world in therms of fleet with 16.5K available vehicles.[215] Another sharing system is bike sharing (*Velobike*) of a fleet formed by 3000 traditional and electrical bicycles.[216] The *Delisamokat* is a new sharing service that provides electrical scooters.[217] There are companies that provide different vehicles to the population in proximity to Moscow's big parks.\n\n\n\n### Future development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2020 development concept of Moscow International Business Center and its adjacent territory implies the construction of even more skyscrapers during the period of 2020–2027.[218][219]\nIn 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the Moscow International Business Center, with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,[220] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. Situated in Presnensky District and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development. The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to one square kilometre (250 acres). The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.\n\n\nThe Federation Tower, completed in 2016, is the second-tallest building in Europe. It is planned to include a water park and other recreational facilities; business, office, entertainment, and residential buildings, a transport network and a new site for the Moscow government. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has been completed, two of which have opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. \n\n\n\n* A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with the Sheremetyevo International Airport is also planned.\n\n\nMajor thoroughfares through MIBC are the Third Ring and Kutuzovsky Prospekt.\n\n\nThree metro stations were initially planned for the Filyovskaya Line. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005 and was later renamed Vystavochnaya in 2009. The branch extended to the Mezhdunarodnaya station in 2006, and all work on the third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between Kiyevskaya and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed.

The city stands on the Moskva River in Central Russia, with a population estimated at 13.0 million residents within the city limits,[6] over 18.8 million residents in the urban area,[7] and over 21.5 million residents in the metropolitan area.[14] The city covers an area of 2,511 square kilometers (970 sq mi), while the urban area covers 5,891 square kilometers (2,275 sq mi),[7] and the metropolitan area covers over 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 sq mi).[14] Moscow is among the world's largest cities, being the most populous city entirely in Europe, the largest urban and metropolitan area in Europe,[7][14] and the largest city by land area on the European continent.[15]\n\n\nFirst documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. When the Tsardom of Russia was proclaimed, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of its history. Under the reign of Peter the Great, the Russian capital was moved to the newly founded city of Saint Petersburg in 1712, diminishing Moscow's influence. Following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Russian SFSR, the capital was moved back to Moscow in 1918, where it later became the political center of the Soviet Union.[16] In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained the capital city of the newly established Russian Federation.\n\n\nThe northernmost and coldest megacity in the world, Moscow is governed as a federal city,[17] where it serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of Russia and Eastern Europe. As an alpha world city,[18] Moscow has one of the world's largest urban economies.[19] The city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world,[20] and is one of Europe's most visited cities. Moscow is home to the sixth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[21] The Moscow International Business Center is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world, and features the majority of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[22]\n\n\nAs the historic core of Russia, Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its various museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is well known for its display of Russian architecture, particularly its historic Red Square, and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin, of which the latter serves as the seat of power of the Government of Russia. Moscow is home to many Russian companies in numerous industries and is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, and most notably the Moscow Metro, the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world. The city has over 40 percent of its territory covered by greenery, making it one of the greenest cities in the world.[15][23]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the city is thought to be derived from the name of the Moskva River.[24][25] Several theories of the origin of the name of the river have been proposed. Finno-Ugric Merya and Muroma people, who were among the several pre-Slavic tribes which originally inhabited the area, called the river supposedly *Mustajoki*, in English: *Black river*. It has been suggested that the name of the city derives from this term.[26][27]\n\n\nThe most linguistically well-grounded and widely accepted is from the Proto-Balto-Slavic root \\**mŭzg*-/*muzg*- from the Proto-Indo-European \\**meu*- \"wet\",[25][28][29] so the name *Moskva* might signify a river at a wetland or a marsh.[24] Its cognates include Russian: музга, *muzga* \"pool, puddle\", Lithuanian: *mazgoti* and Latvian: *mazgāt* \"to wash\", Sanskrit: májjati \"to drown\", Latin: *mergō* \"to dip, immerse\".[24][28] In many Slavic countries Moskov is a surname, most common in Russia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and North Macedonia.[30] Additionally, there are similarly named places in Poland like Mozgawa.[24][25][28]\n\n\nThe original Old Russian form of the name is reconstructed as \\*Москы, \\**Mosky*,[24][25] hence it was one of a few Slavic *ū*-stem nouns. As with other nouns of that declension, it had been undergoing a morphological transformation at the early stage of the development of the language, as a result, the first written mentions in the 12th century were Московь, *Moskovĭ* (accusative case), Москви, *Moskvi* (locative case), Москвe/Москвѣ, *Moskve/Moskvě* (genitive case).[24][25] From the latter forms came to the modern Russian name Москва, *Moskva*, which is a result of morphological generalization with the numerous Slavic *ā*-stem nouns.\n\n\nHowever, the form *Moskovĭ* has left some traces in many other languages, including English: Moscow, German: *Moskau*, French: *Moscou*, Georgian: მოსკოვი, Latvian: *Maskava*, Bashkir: Мәскәү, Tatar: *Mäskäw*, Portuguese: *Moscovo*, Chuvash: Мускав, and Spanish: *Moscú*. \n\n\nIn a similar manner the Latin name *Moscovia* has been formed, later it became a colloquial name for Russia used in Western Europe in the 16th–17th centuries. From it as well came English *Muscovy* and *muscovite*.[31][*failed verification*]\n\n\nVarious other theories (of Celtic, Iranian, Caucasic origins), having little or no scientific ground, are now largely rejected by contemporary linguists.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other names[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has acquired several epithets, most referring to its size and preeminent status within the nation: The *Third Rome* (Третий Рим), the *Whitestone One* (Белокаменная), the *First Throne* (Первопрестольная), the *Forty Soroks* (Сорок Сороков) (\"sorok\" meaning both \"forty, a great many\" and \"a district or parish\" in Old Russian). Moscow is also one of the twelve Hero Cities. The demonym for a Moscow resident is \"москвич\" (*moskvich*) for male or \"москвичка\" (*moskvichka*) for female, rendered in English as *Muscovite*. The name \"Moscow\" is abbreviated \"MSK\" (МСК in Russian).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Moscow\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Moscow.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nArchaeological digs show that the site of today's Moscow and the surrounding area have been inhabited since time immemorial. Among the earliest finds are relics of the Lyalovo culture, which experts assign to the Neolithic period, the last phase of the Stone Age.[32]\n\n\nThey confirm that the first inhabitants of the area were hunters and gatherers. Around 950 AD, two Slavic tribes, Vyatichi and Krivichi, settled here. Possibly the Vyatichi formed the core of Moscow's indigenous population.[33]\n\n\n\n### Early history (1147–1284)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kievan Rus' and Vladimir-Suzdal\n\n![](image)Vladimir-Suzdal, a principality on the northeastern periphery of Kievan Rus', grew into the Grand Duchy of Moscow.\nThe first known reference to Moscow dates from 1147 as a meeting place of Yuri Dolgoruky and Sviatoslav Olgovich. At the time it was a minor town on the western border of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. The chronicle says, \"Come, my brother, to Moskov\" (Приди ко мне, брате, в Москов).[34]\n\n\nIn 1156, Knyaz Yuri Dolgorukiy fortified the town with a timber fence and a moat. In the course of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus', the Mongols under Batu Khan burned the city to the ground and killed its inhabitants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe timber fort *na Moskvě* \"on the Moscow River\" was inherited by Daniel, the youngest son of Alexander Nevsky, in the 1260s, at the time considered the least valuable of his father's possessions.\nDaniel was still a child at the time, and the big fort was governed by *tiuns* (deputies), appointed by Daniel's paternal uncle, Yaroslav of Tver.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDaniel came of age in the 1270s and became involved in the power struggles of the principality with lasting success, siding with his brother Dmitry in his bid for the rule of Novgorod. From 1283 he acted as the ruler of an independent principality alongside Dmitry, who became Grand Duke of Vladimir.\nDaniel has been credited with founding the first Moscow monasteries, dedicated to the Lord's Epiphany and to Saint Daniel.[35]\n\n\n\n### Grand Duchy (1283–1547)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grand Duchy of Moscow\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| The Moscow Kremlin in the late 16th century\n | The 1382 siege of Moscow | Red Square |\n\n\nDaniel ruled Moscow as Grand Duke until 1303 and established it as a prosperous city that would eclipse its parent principality of Vladimir by the 1320s.\n\n\nOn the right bank of the Moskva River, at a distance of eight kilometres (5 mi) from the Kremlin, not later than in 1282, Daniel founded the first monastery with the wooden church of St. Daniel-Stylite, which is now the Danilov Monastery. Daniel died in 1303, at the age of 42. Before his death, he became a monk and, according to his will, was buried in the cemetery of the St. Daniel Monastery.\n\n\nMoscow was quite stable and prosperous for many years and attracted a large number of refugees from across Russia. The Rurikids maintained large landholdings by practicing primogeniture, whereby all land was passed to the eldest sons, rather than dividing it up among all sons. By 1304, Yury of Moscow contested with Mikhail of Tver for the throne of the principality of Vladimir. Ivan I eventually defeated Tver to become the sole collector of taxes for the Mongol rulers, making Moscow the capital of Vladimir-Suzdal. By paying high tribute, Ivan won an important concession from the Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Spassky Cathedral (Moscow's oldest extant building), built c. 1357\nWhile the Khan of the Golden Horde initially attempted to limit Moscow's influence, when the growth of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania began to threaten all of Russia, the Khan strengthened Moscow to counterbalance Lithuania, allowing it to become one of the most powerful cities in Russia. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow led a united Russian army to an important victory over the Mongols in the Battle of Kulikovo. Afterward, Moscow took the leading role in liberating Russia from Mongol domination. In 1480, Ivan III had finally broken the Russians free from Tatar control, and Moscow became the capital of an empire that would eventually encompass all of Russia and Siberia, and parts of many other lands.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spasskaya Tower, built in 1491\nIn 1462 Ivan III, (1440–1505) became Grand Prince of Moscow (then part of the medieval Muscovy state). He began fighting the Tatars, enlarged the territory of Muscovy, and enriched his capital city. By 1500 it had a population of 100,000 and was one of the largest cities in the world. He conquered the far larger principality of Novgorod to the north, which had been allied to the hostile Lithuanians. Thus he enlarged the territory sevenfold, from 430,000 to 2,800,000 square kilometres (170,000 to 1,080,000 square miles). He took control of the ancient \"Novgorod Chronicle\" and made it a propaganda vehicle for his regime.[36][37]\n\n\nThe original Moscow Kremlin was built in the 14th century. It was reconstructed by Ivan, who in the 1480s invited architects from Renaissance Italy, such as Petrus Antonius Solarius, who designed the new Kremlin wall and its towers, and Marco Ruffo who designed the new palace for the prince. The Kremlin walls as they now appear are those designed by Solarius, completed in 1495. The Kremlin's Great Bell Tower was built in 1505–08 and augmented to its present height in 1600.\n\n\nA trading settlement, or *posad*, grew up to the east of the Kremlin, in the area known as *Zaradye* (Зарядье). In the time of Ivan III, the Red Square, originally named the Hollow Field (Полое поле) appeared.\n\n\nIn 1508–1516, the Italian architect Aleviz Fryazin (Novy) arranged for the construction of a moat in front of the eastern wall, which would connect the Moskva and Neglinnaya and be filled in with water from Neglinnaya. This moat, known as the Alevizov moat and having a length of 541 metres (1,775 feet), width of 36 metres (118 feet), and a depth of 9.5 to 13 metres (31–43 feet) was lined with limestone and, in 1533, fenced on both sides with low, four-metre-thick (13-foot) cogged-brick walls.\n\n\n\n### Tsardom (1547–1721)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Tsardom of Russia\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral, built in 1561\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the three circular defenses were built: Kitay-gorod (Китай-город), the White City (Белый город) and the Earthen City (Земляной город). However, in 1547, two fires destroyed much of the town, and in 1571 the Crimean Tatars captured Moscow, burning everything except the Kremlin.[38] The annals record that only 30,000 of 200,000 inhabitants survived.\n\n\n\n![](image)View of 17th-century Moscow (1922 drawing by Apollinary Vasnetsov)\nThe Crimean Tatars attacked again in 1591, but this time were held back by new defense walls, built between 1584 and 1591 by a craftsman named Fyodor Kon. In 1592, an outer earth rampart with 50 towers was erected around the city, including an area on the right bank of the Moscow River. As an outermost line of defense, a chain of strongly fortified monasteries was established beyond the ramparts to the south and east, principally the Novodevichy Convent and Donskoy, Danilov, Simonov, Novospasskiy, and Andronikov monasteries, most of which now house museums. From its ramparts, the city became poetically known as *Bielokamennaya*, the \"White-Walled.\" The city's limits as marked by the ramparts built in 1592 are now marked by the Garden Ring.\n\n\nThree square gates existed on the eastern side of the Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas that hung over them). The last two were directly opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Sigismundian\" Plan of Moscow (1610), named after Sigismund III of Poland, is the last city plan compiled before the destruction of the city in 1612 by retreating Polish troops and subsequent changes to the street network. Orientation: north is at the right, west at the top.\nThe Russian famine of 1601–03 killed perhaps 100,000 in Moscow. From 1610 through 1612, troops of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth occupied Moscow, as its ruler Sigismund III tried to take the Russian throne. In 1612, the people of Nizhny Novgorod and other Russian cities conducted by prince Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin rose against the Polish occupants, besieged the Kremlin, and expelled them. In 1613, the Zemsky sobor elected Michael Romanov tsar, establishing the Romanov dynasty. The 17th century was rich in popular risings, such as the liberation of Moscow from the Polish–Lithuanian invaders (1612), the Salt Riot (1648), the Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.\n\n\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, the population of Moscow doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000. It expanded beyond its ramparts in the later 17th century. It is estimated, that in the middle of the 17th century, 20% of Moscow suburb's inhabitants were from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, practically all of them being driven from their homeland to Moscow by Muscovite invaders.[39] By 1682, there were 692 households established north of the ramparts, by Ukrainians and Belarusians abducted from their hometowns in the course of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). These new outskirts of the city came to be known as the *Meshchanskaya sloboda*, after Ruthenian *meshchane* \"town people\". The term *meshchane* (мещане) acquired pejorative connotations in 18th-century Russia and today means \"petty bourgeois\" or \"narrow-minded philistine\".[40]\n\n\nThe entire city of the late 17th century, including the slobodas that grew up outside the city ramparts, are contained within what is today Moscow's Central Administrative Okrug.\n\n\nNumerous disasters befell the city. The plague epidemics ravaged Moscow in 1570–1571, 1592 and 1654–1656.[41] The plague killed upwards of 80% of the people in 1654–55. Fires burned out much of the wooden city in 1626 and 1648.[42] In 1712 Peter the Great moved his government to the newly built Saint Petersburg on the Baltic coast. Moscow ceased to be Russia's capital, except for a brief period from 1728 to 1732 under the influence of the Supreme Privy Council.\n\n\n\n### Empire (1721–1917)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Governorate\n\nFurther information: Russian Empire\n\n![Panorama of Moscow in 1819-1823](image)\nA panoramic view of Moscow from the Spasskaya Tower in 1819–1823\n\n![](image)Moskva riverfront in the 19th century\nAfter losing the status as the capital of the empire, the population of Moscow at first decreased, from 200,000 in the 17th century to 130,000 in 1750. But after 1750, the population grew more than tenfold over the remaining duration of the Russian Empire, reaching 1.8 million by 1915. The 1770–1772 Russian plague killed up to 100,000 people in Moscow.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bookshops at the Novospassky Bridge in the 17th century, by Apollinary Vasnetsov\nBy 1700, the building of cobbled roads had begun. In November 1730, the permanent street light was introduced, and by 1867 many streets had a gaslight. In 1883, near the Prechistinskiye Gates, arc lamps were installed. In 1741 Moscow was surrounded by a barricade 40 kilometres (25 mi) long, the Kamer-Kollezhskiy barrier, with 16 gates at which customs tolls were collected. Its line is traced today by a number of streets called *val* (\"ramparts\").\nBetween 1781 and 1804 the Mytischinskiy water pipe (the first in Russia) was built. In 1813, following the destruction of much of the city during the French occupation, a Commission for the Construction of the City of Moscow was established. It launched a great program of rebuilding, including a partial replanning of the city-centre. Among many buildings constructed or reconstructed at this time was the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury, the Moscow University, the Moscow Manege (Riding School), and the Bolshoi Theatre. In 1903 the Moskvoretskaya water supply was completed.\n\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Arch of Konstantino-Elenensky gate was paved with bricks, but the Spassky Gate was the main front gate of the Kremlin and used for royal entrances. From this gate, wooden and (following the 17th-century improvements) stone bridges stretched across the moat. Books were sold on this bridge and stone platforms were built nearby for guns – \"raskats\". The Tsar Cannon was located on the platform of the Lobnoye mesto.\n\n\nThe road connecting Moscow with St. Petersburg, now the M10 highway, was completed in 1746, its Moscow end following the old Tver road, which had existed since the 16th century. It became known as *Peterburskoye Schosse* after it was paved in the 1780s. Petrovsky Palace was built in 1776–1780 by Matvey Kazakov.\n\n\n\n![](image)Napoleon retreating from the city during the Fire of Moscow, after the failed French Invasion of Russia\nWhen Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, the Moscovites were evacuated. It is suspected that the Moscow fire was principally the effect of Russian sabotage. Napoleon's *Grande Armée* was forced to retreat and was nearly annihilated by the devastating Russian winter and sporadic attacks by Russian military forces. As many as 400,000 of Napoleon's soldiers died during this time.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral Square during the coronation of Alexander I, 1802, by Fyodor Alekseyev\nMoscow State University was established in 1755. Its main building was reconstructed after the 1812 fire by Domenico Giliardi. The *Moskovskiye Vedomosti* newspaper appeared from 1756, originally in weekly intervals, and from 1859 as a daily newspaper.\n\n\nThe Arbat Street had been in existence since at least the 15th century, but it was developed into a prestigious area during the 18th century. It was destroyed in the fire of 1812 and was rebuilt completely in the early 19th century.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, general Alexander Bashilov planned the first regular grid of city streets north from Petrovsky Palace. Khodynka field south of the highway was used for military training. Smolensky Rail station (forerunner of present-day Belorussky Rail Terminal) was inaugurated in 1870. Sokolniki Park, in the 18th century the home of the tsar's falconers well outside Moscow, became contiguous with the expanding city in the later 19th century and was developed into a public municipal park in 1878. The suburban Savyolovsky Rail Terminal was built in 1902. In January 1905, the institution of the City Governor, or Mayor, was officially introduced in Moscow, and Alexander Adrianov became Moscow's first official mayor.\n\n\nWhen Catherine II came to power in 1762, the city's filth and the smell of sewage were depicted by observers as a symptom of disorderly lifestyles of lower-class Russians recently arrived from the farms. Elites called for improving sanitation, which became part of Catherine's plans for increasing control over social life. National political and military successes from 1812 through 1855 calmed the critics and validated efforts to produce a more enlightened and stable society. There was less talk about the smell and the poor conditions of public health. However, in the wake of Russia's failures in the Crimean War in 1855–56, confidence in the ability of the state to maintain order in the slums eroded, and demands for improved public health put filth back on the agenda.[45]\n\n\n\n### Soviet period (1917–1991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City plan of Moscow, 1917\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Song from the Soviet film |\n\n\nIn November 1917, upon learning of the uprising happening in Petrograd, Moscow's Bolsheviks also began their uprising. On November 2 (15), 1917, after heavy fighting, Soviet power was established in Moscow.[46]\n\n\nThen Vladimir Lenin, fearing possible foreign invasion, moved the capital from Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) back to Moscow on March 12, 1918.[47] The Kremlin once again became the seat of power and the political centre of the new state.\n\n\nWith the change in values imposed by communist ideology, the tradition of preservation of cultural heritage was broken. Independent preservation societies, even those that defended only secular landmarks such as Moscow-based OIRU were disbanded by the end of the 1920s. A new anti-religious campaign, launched in 1929, coincided with the collectivization of peasants; the destruction of churches in the cities peaked around 1932. In 1937 several letters were written to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to rename Moscow to \"Stalindar\" or \"Stalinodar,\" one from an elderly pensioner whose dream was to \"live in Stalinodar\" and had selected the name to represent the \"gift\" (dar) of the genius of Stalin.[48] Stalin rejected this suggestion, and after it was suggested again to him by Nikolai Yezhov, he was outraged, saying \"What do I need this for?\". This was following Stalin banning the renaming of places in his name in 1936.[49]\n\n\nDuring World War II, the Soviet State Committee of Defence and the General Staff of the Red Army were located in Moscow. In 1941, 16 divisions of the national volunteers (more than 160,000 people), 25 battalions (18,000 people), and four engineering regiments were formed among the Muscovites. Between October 1941 and January 1942, the German Army Group Centre was stopped at the outskirts of the city and then driven off in the course of the Battle of Moscow. Many factories were evacuated, together with much of the government, and from October 20 the city was declared to be in a state of siege. Its remaining inhabitants built and manned antitank defenses, while the city was bombarded from the air. On May 1, 1944, a medal \"For the defence of Moscow\" and in 1947 another medal \"In memory of the 800th anniversary of Moscow\" was instituted.\n\n\nBoth German and Soviet casualties during the Battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Total casualties between September 30, 1941, and January 7, 1942, are estimated to be between 248,000 and 400,000 for the Wehrmacht and between 650,000 and 1,280,000 for the Red Army.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Funeral procession at the funeral of Joseph Stalin, 1953\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Stalins USSR in 1953 |\n\n\nDuring the postwar years, there was a serious housing crisis, solved by the invention of high-rise apartments. There are over 11,000 of these standardised and prefabricated apartment blocks, housing the majority of Moscow's population, making it by far the city with the most high-rise buildings.[53] Apartments were built and partly furnished in the factory before being raised and stacked into tall columns. The popular Soviet-era comic film *Irony of Fate* parodies this construction method.\n\n\nThe city of Zelenograd was built in 1958 at 37 kilometres (23 miles) from the city centre to the north-west, along with the Leningradskoye Shosse, and incorporated as one of Moscow's administrative okrugs. Moscow State University moved to its campus on Sparrow Hills in 1953.\n\n\nIn 1959 Nikita Khrushchev launched his anti-religious campaign. By 1964 over 10 thousand churches out of 20 thousand were shut down (mostly in rural areas) and many were demolished. Of 58 monasteries and convents operating in 1959, only sixteen remained by 1964; of Moscow's fifty churches operating in 1959, thirty were closed and six demolished.\n\n\n\n![](image)Soviet parade outside Hotel Moskva on the Manezhnaya Square, 1964\nOn May 8, 1965, due to the actual 20th anniversary of the victory in World War II, Moscow was awarded a title of the Hero City.\n\n\n\n![](image)Victory Day celebration on Red Square, May 9, 1975\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) was opened in 1961. It had four lanes running 109 kilometres (68 miles) along the city borders. The MKAD marked the administrative boundaries of the city of Moscow until the 1980s when outlying suburbs beyond the ring road began to be incorporated. In 1980, Moscow hosted the Summer Olympic Games, which were boycotted by the United States and several other Western countries due to the Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan in late 1979. In 1991 Moscow was the scene of a coup attempt by conservative communists opposed to the liberal reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\n\n\n### Recent history (1991–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Floating bridge in Zaryadye Park, with the Red Square and the Moscow Kremlin in the distance\n![](image)Tverskaya Street, the main radial street in the city\nWhen the USSR was dissolved in the same year, Moscow remained the capital of the Russian SFSR (on December 25, 1991, the Russian SFSR was renamed the Russian Federation). Since then, a market economy has emerged in Moscow, producing an explosion of Western-style retailing, services, architecture, and lifestyles.\n\n\nThe city has continued to grow during the 1990s to 2000s, its population rising from below nine to above ten million. Mason and Nigmatullina argue that Soviet-era urban-growth controls (before 1991) produced controlled and sustainable metropolitan development, typified by the greenbelt built in 1935. Since then, however, there has been a dramatic growth of low-density suburban sprawl, created by heavy demand for single-family dwellings as opposed to crowded apartments. In 1995–1997 the MKAD ring road was widened from the initial four to ten lanes.\n\n\nIn December 2002 Bulvar Dmitriya Donskogo became the first Moscow Metro station that opened beyond the limits of MKAD. The Third Ring Road, intermediate between the early 19th-century Garden Ring and the Soviet-era outer ring road, was completed in 2004. The greenbelt is becoming more and more fragmented, and satellite cities are appearing at the fringe. Summer dachas are being converted into year-round residences, and with the proliferation of automobiles there is heavy traffic congestion.[54] Multiple old churches and other examples of architectural heritage that had been demolished during the Stalin era have been restored, such as the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.\nIn 2010s Moscow's Administration has launched some long duration projects like the *Moja Ulitsa* (in English: *My Street*) urban redevelopment program[55] or the Residency renovation one.[56]\n\n\nBy its territorial expansion on July 1, 2012, southwest into the Moscow Oblast the area of the capital more than doubled, going from 1,091 to 2,511 square kilometers (421 to 970 sq mi), resulting in Moscow becoming the largest city on the European continent by area; it also gained an additional population of 233,000 people.[57][58] The annexed territory was officially named *Новая Москва* (New Moscow).\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Moscow and its nearby suburbs\nMoscow is situated on the banks of the Moskva River, which flows for just over 500 km (311 mi) through the East European Plain in central Russia, not far from the natural border of the forest and forest-steppe zone. 49 bridges span the river and its canals within the city's limits. The elevation of Moscow at the All-Russia Exhibition Center (VVC), where the leading Moscow weather station is situated, is 156 metres (512 feet). Teplostan Upland is the city's highest point at 255 metres (837 feet).[59] The width of Moscow city (not limiting MKAD) from west to east is 39.7 km (24.7 mi), and the length from north to south is 51.8 km (32.2 mi).\n\n\n\n### Time[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Time\n\nMoscow serves as the reference point for the time zone used in most of European Russia, Belarus and the Republic of Crimea. The areas operate in what is referred to in international standards as *Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК)*, which is 3 hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+3. Daylight saving time is no longer observed. According to the geographical longitude the average solar noon in Moscow occurs at 12:30.[60]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Moscow\n\n![](image)VDNKh after rain\nMoscow has a humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dfb*) with long, cold (although average by Russian standards) winters usually lasting from mid-November to the end of March, and warm summers. More extreme continental climates at the same latitude- such as parts of Eastern Canada or Siberia- have much colder winters than Moscow, suggesting that there is still significant moderation from the Atlantic Ocean despite the fact that Moscow is far from the sea. Weather can fluctuate widely, with temperatures ranging from −25 °C (−13 °F) in the city and −30 °C (−22 °F) in the suburbs to above 5 °C (41 °F) in the winter, and from 10 to 35 °C (50 to 95 °F) in the summer.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Petrovsky Palace on Leningradsky Avenue in winter\nTypical high temperatures in the warm months of June, July, and August are around a comfortable 20 to 26 °C (68 to 79 °F), but during heat waves (which can occur between May and September), daytime high temperatures often exceed 30 °C (86 °F), sometimes for a week or two at a time. In the winter, average temperatures normally drop to approximately −10 °C (14 °F), though almost every winter there are periods of warmth with day temperatures rising above 0 °C (32 °F), and periods of cooling with night temperatures falling below −20 °C (−4 °F). These periods usually last about a week or two. The growing season in Moscow normally lasts for 156 days usually around May 1 to October 5.[62]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded was 38.2 °C (100.8 °F)[63] at the VVC weather station and 39.0 °C (102.2 °F) in the center of Moscow and Domodedovo airport on July 29, 2010, during the unusual 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves. Record high and average temperatures were recorded for January, March, April, May, June, July, August, November, and December in 2007–2022.[64] The average July temperature from 1991 to 2020 is 19.7 °C (67.5 °F). The lowest ever recorded temperature was −42.1 °C (−43.8 °F) in January 1940. Snow, which is present for about five months a year, often begins to fall mid-October, while snow cover lies in November and melts at the beginning of April.\n\n\nOn average, Moscow has 1731 hours of sunshine per year, varying from a low of 8% in December to 52% from May to August.[65] This large annual variation is due to convective cloud formation. In the winter, moist air from the Atlantic condenses in the cold continental interior, resulting in very overcast conditions. However, this same continental influence results in considerably sunnier summers than oceanic cities of similar latitude such as Edinburgh. Between 2004 and 2010, the average was between 1800 and 2000 hours with a tendency to more sunshine in summer months, up to a record 411 hours in July 2014, 79% of possible sunshine. December 2017 was the darkest month in Moscow since records began, with only six minutes of sunlight.[66][67]\n\n\nTemperatures in the centre of Moscow are often significantly higher than in the outskirts and nearby suburbs, especially in winter. For example, if the average February temperature in the north-east of Moscow is −6.7 °C (19.9 °F), in the suburbs it is about −9 °C (16 °F).[68] The temperature difference between the centre of Moscow and nearby areas of Moscow Oblast can sometimes be more than 10 °C (18 °F) on frosty winter nights.\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1991–2020, records 1879–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 28.9(84.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 37.3(99.1)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −3.9(25.0)\n | −3(27)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −6.2(20.8)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −8.7(16.3)\n | −8.8(16.2)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | 2.6(36.7)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n | −38.2(−36.8)\n | −32.4(−26.3)\n | −21(−6)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −20.3(−4.5)\n | −32.8(−27.0)\n | −38.8(−37.8)\n | −42.1(−43.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 44(1.7)\n | 39(1.5)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 61(2.4)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 84(3.3)\n | 78(3.1)\n | 66(2.6)\n | 70(2.8)\n | 52(2.0)\n | 51(2.0)\n | 713(28.1)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth cm (inches)\n | 24(9.4)\n | 35(14)\n | 29(11)\n | 2(0.8)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 12(4.7)\n | 35(14)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 8\n | 6\n | 9\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 15\n | 16\n | 16\n | 17\n | 13\n | 8\n | 155\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 25\n | 23\n | 15\n | 6\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.3\n | 5\n | 17\n | 24\n | 116\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 85\n | 81\n | 74\n | 68\n | 67\n | 72\n | 74\n | 78\n | 82\n | 83\n | 86\n | 86\n | 78\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 33\n | 72\n | 128\n | 170\n | 265\n | 279\n | 271\n | 238\n | 147\n | 78\n | 32\n | 18\n | 1,731\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 14\n | 27\n | 35\n | 40\n | 53\n | 53\n | 52\n | 51\n | 38\n | 24\n | 13\n | 8\n | 34\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Pogoda.ru.net,[69][70] Thermograph.ru,[71] Meteoweb.ru (sunshine hours)[72] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[73] |\n\n| Climate data for Moscow (VVC) normals 1961–1990\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −6.3(20.7)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.5(34.7)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 1.1(34.0)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | 8.9(48.0)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 13.1(55.6)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.1(41.2)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −11.1(12.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 7.1(44.8)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n |\n| Source: [74][75][76][77] |\n\nRecent changes in Moscow's regional climate, since it is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, are often cited by climate scientists as evidence of global warming[*citation needed*], though by definition, climate change is global, not regional. During the summer, extreme heat is often observed in the city (2001, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2021). Along with a southern part of Central Russia,[78][79] after recent years of hot summer seasons, the climate of the city gets hot-summer classification trends. Winter also became significantly milder: for example, the average January temperature in the early 1900s was −12.0 °C (10.4 °F), while now it is about −7.0 °C (19.4 °F).[80] At the end of January–February it is often colder, with frosts reaching −30.0 °C (−22.0 °F) a few nights per year (2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013).\n\n\nThe last decade was the warmest in the history of meteorological observations of Moscow.

According to Russia's Federal Migration Service, Moscow holds 1.8 million official \"guests\" who have temporary residency on the basis of visas or other documentation, giving a legal population of 14.8 million. The number of Illegal immigrants, the vast majority originating from Central Asia, is estimated to be an additional 1 million people,[92] giving a total population of about 15.8 million.\n\n\n**Vital statistics for 2022:**[93][94]\n\n\n\n* Births: 123,654 (9.8 per 1,000)\n* Deaths: 126,988 (10.1 per 1,000)\n\n\n**Total fertility rate (2022):**[95]   \n\n1.42 children per woman\n\n\n**Life expectancy (2021):**[96]   \n\nTotal — 74.55 years (male — 71.00, female — 77.94)\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in Moscow (2020)[97][98] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Russian Orthodoxy |  | 55% |\n| Atheism and irreligion |  | 28% |\n| Islam |  | 8% |\n| Other religions |  | 3% |\n| Other Christians |  | 2% |\n| Undeclared |  | 4% |\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise from left**: the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, demolished during the Soviet period and reconstructed from 1990–2000; Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception; Moscow Cathedral Mosque; and Moscow Choral Synagogue\n\nChristians form the majority of the city's population; most of whom adhere Russian Orthodox Church. The Patriarch of Moscow serves as the head of the church and resides in the Danilov Monastery. Moscow was called the \"city of 40 times 40 churches\"—prior to 1917. Moscow is Russia's capital of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has been the country's traditional religion.\n\n\nOther religions practiced in Moscow include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Yazidism, and Rodnovery. The Moscow Mufti Council claimed that Muslims numbered around 1.5 million of 10.5 million of the city's population in 2010;[99] There are four mosques in the city.[100]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Moscow\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, a masterpiece of Russian architecture\n![](image)The State Historical Museum, an example of the Neo-Russian style\n![](image)The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, an example of Neo-Byzantine architecture\nMoscow's architecture is world-renowned. Moscow is the site of Saint Basil's Cathedral, with its elegant onion domes, as well as the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and the Seven Sisters. The first Kremlin was built in the middle of the 12th century.\n\n\nMedieval Moscow's design was of concentric walls and intersecting radial thoroughfares. This layout, as well as Moscow's rivers, helped shape Moscow's design in subsequent centuries.\n\n\nThe Kremlin was rebuilt in the 15th century. Its towers and some of its churches were built by Italian architects, lending the city some of the aurae of the renaissance. From the end of the 15th century, the city was embellished by masonry structures such as monasteries, palaces, walls, towers, and churches.\n\n\nThe city's appearance had not changed much by the 18th century. Houses were made of pine and spruce logs, with shingled roofs plastered with sod or covered by birch bark. The rebuilding of Moscow in the second half of the 18th century was necessitated by constant fires and the needs of the nobility. Much of the wooden city was replaced by buildings in the classical style.[101]\n\n\nFor much of its architectural history, Moscow was dominated by Orthodox churches. However, the overall appearance of the city changed drastically during Soviet times, especially as a result of Joseph Stalin's large-scale effort to \"modernize\" Moscow. Stalin's plans for the city included a network of broad avenues and roadways, some of them over ten lanes wide, which, while greatly simplifying movement through the city, were constructed at the expense of a great number of historical buildings and districts. Among the many casualties of Stalin's demolitions was the Sukharev Tower, a longtime city landmark, as well as mansions and commercial buildings. The city's newfound status as the capital of a deeply secular nation, made religiously significant buildings especially vulnerable to demolition. Many of the city's churches, which in most cases were some of Moscow's oldest and most prominent buildings, were destroyed; some notable examples include the Kazan Cathedral and the Cathedral of Christ the Savior. During the 1990s, both were rebuilt. Many smaller churches, however, were lost.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)GUM department store, facing the Red Square\n![](image)Ostankino Tower, the tallest freestanding structure in Europe, and the eighth-tallest in the world\nWhile the later Stalinist period was characterized by the curtailing of creativity and architectural innovation, the earlier post-revolutionary years saw a plethora of radical new buildings created in the city. Especially notable were the constructivist architects associated with VKHUTEMAS, responsible for such landmarks as Lenin's Mausoleum. Another prominent architect was Vladimir Shukhov, famous for Shukhov Tower, just one of many hyperboloid towers designed by Shukhov. It was built between 1919 and 1922 as a transmission tower for a Russian broadcasting company.[103] Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia. He designed spacious elongated shop galleries, most notably the GUM department store on Red Square,[103] bridged with innovative metal-and-glass vaults.\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the Seven Sisters, Hotel Ukraina, is the tallest hotel in Europe, and one of the tallest hotels in the world.\n![](image)Zhivopisny Bridge, the highest cable-stayed bridge in Europe\nPerhaps the most recognizable contributions of the Stalinist period are the so-called Seven Sisters, seven massive skyscrapers scattered throughout the city at about an equal distance from the Kremlin. A defining feature of Moscow's skyline, their imposing form was allegedly inspired by the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York City, and their style—with intricate exteriors and a large central spire—has been described as Stalinist Gothic architecture. All seven towers can be seen from most high points in the city; they are among the tallest constructions in central Moscow apart from the Ostankino Tower, which, when it was completed in 1967, was the highest free-standing land structure in the world and today remains the world's seventy-second tallest, ranking among buildings such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the CN Tower in Toronto.[104]\n\n\nThe Soviet goal of providing housing for every family, and the rapid growth of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks. Most of these date from the post-Stalin era and the styles are often named after the leader then in power (Brezhnev, Khrushchev, etc.). They are usually badly maintained.\n\n\nAlthough the city still has some five-story apartment buildings constructed before the mid-1960s, more recent apartment buildings are usually at least nine floors tall, and have elevators. It is estimated that Moscow has over twice as many elevators as New York City and four times as many as Chicago. Moslift, one of the city's major elevator operating companies, has about 1500 elevator mechanics on call, to release residents trapped in elevators.[105]\n\n\nStalinist-era buildings, mostly found in the central part of the city, are massive and usually ornamented with Socialist realism motifs that imitate classical themes. However, small churches—almost always Eastern Orthodox– found across the city provide glimpses of its past. The Old Arbat Street, a tourist street that was once the heart of a bohemian area, preserves most of its buildings from prior to the 20th century. Many buildings found off the main streets of the inner city (behind the Stalinist façades of Tverskaya Street, for example) are also examples of bourgeois architecture typical of Tsarist times. Ostankino Palace, Kuskovo, Uzkoye and other large estates just outside Moscow originally belong to nobles from the Tsarist era, and some convents, and monasteries, both inside and outside the city, are open to Muscovites and tourists.\n\n\n\n![](image)Modern methods of skyscraper construction were implemented in the city for the first time with the ambitious MIBC.\nAttempts are being made to restore many of the city's best-kept examples of pre-Soviet architecture. These restored structures are easily spotted by their bright new colors and spotless façades. There are a few examples of notable, early Soviet avant-garde work too, such as the house of the architect Konstantin Melnikov in the Arbat area. Many of these restorations were criticized for alleged disrespect of historical authenticity. Facadism is also widely practiced.[106] Later examples of interesting Soviet architecture are usually marked by their impressive size and the semi-Modernist styles employed, such as with the Novy Arbat project, familiarly known as \"false teeth of Moscow\" and notorious for the wide-scale disruption of a historic area in central Moscow involved in the project.\n\n\n\n![](image)Borovitskaya square, Monument to Vladimir the Great and Pashkov House\nPlaques on house exteriors will inform passers-by that a well-known personality once lived there. Frequently, the plaques are dedicated to Soviet celebrities not well known outside (or often, like with decorated generals and revolutionaries, now both inside) of Russia. There are also many \"museum houses\" of famous Russian writers, composers, and artists in the city.\n\n\nMoscow's skyline is quickly modernizing, with several new towers under construction.\nIn recent years, the city administration has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed in the past few years[107] to make space for luxury apartments and hotels.[108] Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years, more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century.[109] Some critics also wonder if the money used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov[110] and Mayakovskaya metro station.\n\n\nSome organizations, such as Moscow Architecture Preservation Society[111] and Save Europe's Heritage,[112] are trying to draw the international public attention to these problems.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Panoramic view of Moscow\n | Panoramic view of Moscow\n |\n\n\n### Parks and landmarks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Moscow tourist attractions\n\n![](image)\nRed Square is a World Heritage Site.\n\nThere are 96 parks and 18 gardens in Moscow, including four botanical gardens. There are 450 square kilometres (170 sq mi) of green zones besides 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi) of forests.[114] Moscow is a very green city, if compared to other cities of comparable size in Western Europe and North America; this is partly due to a history of having green \"yards\" with trees and grass, between residential buildings. There are on average 27 square meters (290 sq ft) of parks per person in Moscow compared with 6 for Paris, 7.5 in London and 8.6 in New York.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gorky Park\nGorky Park (officially the Central Park of Culture and Rest named after Maxim Gorky), was founded in 1928. The main part (689,000 square metres or 170 acres)[115] along the Moskva river contains estrades, children's attractions (including the *Observation Wheel* water ponds with boats and water bicycles), dancing, tennis courts and other sports facilities. It borders the Neskuchny Garden (408,000 square metres or 101 acres), the oldest park in Moscow and a former imperial residence, created as a result of the integration of three estates in the 18th century. The Garden features the Green Theater, one of the largest open amphitheaters in Europe, able to hold up to 15 thousand people.[116] Several parks include a section known as a \"Park of Culture and Rest\", sometimes alongside a much wilder area (this includes parks such as Izmaylovsky, Fili and Sokolniki). Some parks are designated as Forest Parks (lesopark).\n\n\n\n![](image)Dream Island, the largest indoor theme park in Europe\nIzmaylovsky Park, created in 1931, is one of the largest urban parks in the world along with Richmond Park in London. Its area of 15.34 square kilometres (5.92 sq mi) is six times greater than that of Central Park in New York.[115]\n\n\nBauman Garden, officially founded in 1920 and renamed in 1922 after the bolshevik Nikolay Bauman, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow. It is standing on the site of the former Golitsyn estate and eighteenth-century public garden.[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Novodevichy Convent is a World Heritage Site. Sokolniki Park, named after the falcon hunting that occurred there in the past, is one of the oldest parks in Moscow and has an area of 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi). A central circle with a large fountain is surrounded by birch, maple, and elm tree alleys. A labyrinth composed of green paths lies beyond the park's ponds.\n\n\nLosiny Ostrov National Park (\"Elk Island\" National Park), with a total area of more than 116 square kilometres (45 sq mi), borders Sokolniki Park and was Russia's first national park. It is quite wild, and is also known as the \"city taiga\" – elk can be seen there.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye is a World Heritage Site.\nTsytsin Main Botanical Garden of Academy of Sciences, founded in 1945 is the largest in Europe.[118] It covers the territory of 3.61 square kilometres (1.39 sq mi) bordering the All-Russia Exhibition Center and contains a live exhibition of more than 20 thousand species of plants from around the world, as well as a lab for scientific research. It contains a rosarium with 20 thousand rose bushes, a dendrarium, and an oak forest, with the average age of trees exceeding 100 years. There is a greenhouse taking up more than 5,000 square metres (53,820 square feet) of land.[115]\n\n\nThe All-Russian Exhibition Center (Всероссийский выставочный центр), formerly known as the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) and later Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy (VDNKh), though officially named a \"permanent trade show\", is one of the most prominent examples of Stalinist-era monumental architecture. Among the large spans of a recreational park, areas are scores of elaborate pavilions, each representing either a branch of Soviet industry and science or a USSR republic. Even though during the 1990s it was, and for some part still is, misused as a gigantic shopping center (most of the pavilions are rented out for small businesses), it still retains the bulk of its architectural landmarks, including two monumental fountains (*Stone Flower* and *Friendship of Nations*) and a 360 degrees panoramic cinema. In 2014 the park returned to the name Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, and in the same year, huge renovation works had been started.[119]\n\n\n*Lilac Park*, founded in 1958, has a permanent sculpture display and a large rosarium. Moscow has always been a popular destination for tourists. Some of the more famous attractions include the city's UNESCO World Heritage Site, Moscow Kremlin and Red Square,[120] which was built between the 14th and 17th centuries.[121] The Church of the Ascension at Kolomenskoye, which dates from 1532, is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and another popular attraction.[122]\n\n\nNear the new Tretyakov Gallery there is a sculpture garden, Museon, often called \"the graveyard of fallen monuments\" that displays statues of the former Soviet Union that were removed from their place after its dissolution.\n\n\nOther attractions include the Moscow Zoo, a zoological garden in two sections (the valleys of two streams) linked by a bridge, with nearly a thousand species and more than 6,500 specimens.[123] Each year, the zoo attracts more than 1.2 million visitors.[123] Many of Moscow's parks and landscaped gardens are protected natural environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Zaryadye Park | VDNKh | Victory park on Poklonnaya Hill |\n\n\n## Moscow rings[edit]\n\n\nMoscow's road system is centered roughly on the Kremlin at the heart of the city. From there, roads generally span outwards to intersect with a sequence of circular roads (\"rings\").\n\n\n\n1. The first and innermost major ring, Bulvarnoye Koltso (Boulevard Ring), was built at the former location of the 16th-century city wall around what used to be called Bely Gorod (White Town).[124] The Bulvarnoye Koltso is technically not a ring; it does not form a complete circle, but instead a horseshoe-shaped arc that begins at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior and ends at the Yauza River.\n2. The second primary ring, located outside the Boulevard Ring, is the Sadovoye Koltso (Garden Ring). Like the Boulevard Ring, the Garden Ring follows the path of a 16th-century wall that used to encompass part of Moscow.[124] ![](image)Moscow as viewed from the International Space Station, January 29, 2014\n3. The Third Ring Road, was completed in 2003 as a high-speed freeway.\n4. The Fourth Transport Ring, another freeway, was planned, but cancelled in 2011. A system of chordal highways will replace it.\n\n\nAside from the aforementioned hierarchy, line 5 of Moscow Metro is a circle-shaped looped subway line (hence the name *Koltsevaya Liniya*, literally \"ring line\"), which is located between the *Sadovoye Koltso* and Third Transport Ring.\n\n\nTwo modern overlapping lines of Moscow Metro form \"two hearts\":\n\n\n\n* Line 14. Since September 10, 2016, *Moscow Central Circle* renovated railroad (former *Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga*) was introduced as Line 14 of Moscow Metro. The cone-shaped railroad initially opened in 1908 (freight-only railway from 1934 until the 2016 reopening).\n* Line 11. Another circle metro line - *Big Circle Line* (*Bolshaya Koltsevaya Liniya*) is under construction and will be finished in 2023. Kakhovskaya-Savyolovskaya western half of the line was launched in late 2021.\n\n\nThe outermost ring within Moscow is the Moscow Ring Road (often called *MKAD*, acronym word for Russian *Московская Кольцевая Автомобильная Дорога*), which forms the cultural boundary of the city, and was established in the 1950s. It is to note the method of building the road (usage of ground elevation instead of concrete columns throughout the whole way) formed a wall-like barrier that obstacles building roads under the MKAD highway itself).\n\n\n\n* Before 2012 expansion of Moscow, MKAD was considered an approximate border for Moscow boundaries.\n\n\nOutside Moscow, some of the roads encompassing the city continue to follow this circular pattern seen inside city limits, with the notable examples of *Betonka* roads (highways A107 and A108), originally made of concrete pads.\n\n\nIn order to reduce transit traffic on MKAD, the new ring road (called *CKAD* - *Centralnaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga*, *Central Ring Road*) is now under construction beyond the MKAD.\n\n\n\n### Transport rings in Moscow[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Length\n | Name\n | Type\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9 km | Boulevard Ring – Bulvarnoye Koltso (not a full ring) | Road\n |\n| 16 km | Garden Ring – Sadovoye Koltso (\"B\") | Road\n |\n| 19 km | Koltsevaya line (Line 5) | Metro\n |\n| 35 km | Third Ring Road – Third Transport Ring – Tretye Transportnoye Koltso (TTK) | Road\n |\n| 54 km | Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, re-opened as Moscow Central Ring (MCC) – Line 14 | Railway\n |\n| 20.2 km | Bolshaya Koltsevaya line – Line 11 | Metro\n |\n| 109 km | Moscow Automobile Ring Road – Moskovskaya Koltsevaya Avtomobilnaya Doroga (MKAD) | Road\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums and galleries[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most notable art museums in Moscow is the Tretyakov Gallery, which was founded by Pavel Tretyakov, a wealthy patron of the arts who donated a large private collection to the city.[125] The Tretyakov Gallery is split into two buildings. The Old Tretyakov gallery, the original gallery in the Tretyakovskaya area on the south bank of the Moskva River, houses works in the classic Russian tradition.[126] The works of famous pre-Revolutionary painters, such as Ilya Repin, as well as the works of early Russian icon painters can be found here. Visitors can even see rare originals by early 15th-century iconographer Andrei Rublev.[126]\nThe New Tretyakov gallery, created in Soviet times, mainly contains the works of Soviet artists, as well as of a few contemporary paintings, but there is some overlap with the Old Tretyakov Gallery for early 20th-century art. The new gallery includes a small reconstruction of Vladimir Tatlin's famous *Monument to the Third International* and a mixture of other avant-garde works by artists like Kazimir Malevich and Wassily Kandinsky. Socialist realism features can also be found within the halls of the New Tretyakov Gallery.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts\nAnother art museum in the city of Moscow is the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which was founded by, among others, the father of Marina Tsvetaeva. The Pushkin Museum is similar to the British Museum in London in that its halls are a cross-section of exhibits on world civilisations, with many copies of ancient sculptures. However, it also hosts paintings from every major Western era; works by Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne, and Pablo Picasso are present in the museum's collection.\n\n\nThe State Historical Museum of Russia (Государственный Исторический музей) is a museum of Russian history located between Red Square and Manege Square in Moscow. Its exhibitions range from relics of the prehistoric tribes inhabiting present-day Russia, through priceless artworks acquired by members of the Romanov dynasty. The total number of objects in the museum's collection numbers is several million. The Polytechnical Museum,[127] founded in 1872 is the largest technical museum in Russia, offering a wide array of historical inventions and technological achievements, including humanoid automata from the 18th century and the first Soviet computers. Its collection contains more than 160,000 items.[128] The Borodino Panorama[129] museum located on Kutuzov Avenue provides an opportunity for visitors to experience being on a battlefield with a 360° diorama. It is a part of the large historical memorial commemorating the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812 over Napoleon's army, that includes also the triumphal arch, erected in 1827. There is also a military history museum that includes statues, and military hardware.\nMemorial Museum of Cosmonautics under the Monument to the Conquerors of Space at the end of Cosmonauts Alley is the central memorial place for the Russian space officials.\n\n\nThe Shchusev State Museum of Architecture is the national museum of Russian architecture by the name of the architect Alexey Shchusev near the Kremlin area.\n\n\nMoscow will get its own branch of the Hermitage Museum in 2024, with authorities having agreed upon the final project, to be executed by Hani Rashid, co-founder of New York-based 'Asymptote Architecture' - the same bureau that's behind the city's stock market building, the Busan-based World Business Center Solomon Tower and the Strata Tower in Abu-Dhabi.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Bolshoi Theatre\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMoscow is the heart of the Russian performing arts, including ballet and film, with 68 museums[131] 103[132] theaters, 132 cinemas and 24 concert halls. Among Moscow's theaters and ballet studios is the Bolshoi Theatre and the Malyi Theatre[133] as well as Vakhtangov Theatre and Moscow Art Theatre.\n\n\nThe Moscow International Performance Arts Center,[134] opened in 2003, also known as Moscow International House of Music, is known for its performances in classical music. It has the largest organ in Russia installed in Svetlanov Hall.\n\n\nThere are also two large circuses in Moscow: Moscow State Circus and Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard[135] named after Yuri Nikulin.\n\n\nThe Mosfilm studio was at the heart of many classic films, as it is responsible for both artistic and mainstream productions.[136] However, despite the continued presence and reputation of internationally renowned Russian filmmakers, the once prolific native studios are much quieter. Rare and historical films may be seen in the Salut cinema, where films from the Museum of Cinema[137] collection are shown regularly. International film festivals such as the Moscow International Film Festival, Stalker, Artdocfest, and Moscow Jewish Film Festival are staged in Moscow.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Moscow\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium hosted the 1980 Summer Olympics and the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.\n![](image)Sparrow Hills fanzone during 2018 FIFA World Cup\n![](image)SC Olimpiyskiy was built for the 1980 Summer Olympics.\nOver 500 Olympic sports champions lived in the city by 2005.[138] Moscow is home to 63 stadiums (besides eight football and eleven light athletics maneges), of which Luzhniki Stadium is the largest and the 4th biggest in Europe (it hosted the 1998–99 UEFA Cup, 2007–08 UEFA Champions League finals, the 1980 Summer Olympics, and the 2018 FIFA World Cup with 7 games total, including the final). Forty other sports complexes are located within the city, including 24 with artificial ice. The Olympic Stadium was the world's first indoor arena for bandy and hosted the Bandy World Championship twice.[139] Moscow was again the host of the competition in 2010, this time in Krylatskoye.[140] That arena has also hosted the World Speed Skating Championships. There are also seven horse racing tracks in Moscow,[114] of which Central Moscow Hippodrome,[141] founded in 1834, is the largest.\n\n\n\n![](image)CSKA Arena during a game of KHL, considered to be the second-best ice hockey league in the world\nMoscow was the host city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, with the yachting events being held at Tallinn, in present-day Estonia. Large sports facilities and the main international airport, Sheremetyevo Terminal 2, were built in preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Moscow had made a bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. However, when final voting commenced on July 6, 2005, Moscow was the first city to be eliminated from further rounds. The Games were awarded to London.\n\n\nThe most titled ice hockey team in the Soviet Union and in the world, HC CSKA Moscow comes from Moscow. Other big ice hockey clubs from Moscow are HC Dynamo Moscow, which was the second most titled team in the Soviet Union, and HC Spartak Moscow.\n\n\nThe most titled Soviet, Russian, and one of the most titled Euroleague clubs, is the basketball club from Moscow PBC CSKA Moscow. Moscow hosted the EuroBasket in 1953 and 1965.\n\n\nMoscow had more winners at the USSR and Russian Chess Championship than any other city.\n\n\nThe most titled volleyball team in the Soviet Union and in Europe (CEV Champions League) is VC CSKA Moscow.\n\n\nIn football, FC Spartak Moscow has won more championship titles in the Russian Premier League than any other team. They were second only to FC Dynamo Kyiv in Soviet times. PFC CSKA Moscow became the first Russian football team to win a UEFA title, the UEFA Cup (present-day UEFA Europa League). FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Dynamo Moscow and FC Torpedo Moscow are other professional football teams also based in Moscow.\n\n\n\n* ![Otkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow](image)\n\nOtkrytiye Arena, home of FC Spartak Moscow\n* ![VEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow](image)\n\nVEB Arena, home of PFC CSKA Moscow\n* ![VTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow](image)\n\nVTB Arena, home of FC Dynamo Moscow and HC Dynamo Moscow\n* ![RZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow](image)\n\nRZD Arena, home of FC Lokomotiv Moscow\n\n\nMoscow houses other prominent football, ice hockey, and basketball teams. Because sports organisations in the Soviet Union were once highly centralized, two of the best Union-level teams represented defence and law-enforcing agencies: the Armed Forces (CSKA) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs (Dinamo). There were army and police teams in most major cities. As a result, Spartak, CSKA, and Dinamo were among the best-funded teams in the USSR.\n\n\nThe Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace is located in the Luzniki Olympic Complex. The building works started in 2017 and the opening ceremony took place on June 18, 2019. The investor of the Palace is the billionaire Alisher Usmanov, husband of the former gymnast and gymnastics coach Irina Viner-Usmanova. The total surface of the building is 23,500 m2, which include 3 fitness rooms, locker rooms, rooms reserved for referees and coaches, saunas, a canteen, a cafeteria, 2 ball halls, a Medical center, a hall reserved for journalists, and a hotel for athletes.[142]\n\n\nBecause of Moscow's cold local climate, winter sports have a following. Many of Moscow's large parks offer marked trails for skiing and frozen ponds for skating.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, which hosted games of the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nMoscow hosts the annual Kremlin Cup, a popular tennis tournament on both the WTA and ATP tours. It is one of the ten Tier-I events on the women's tour and a host of Russian players feature every year.\n\n\nSC Olimpiyskiy hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, the first and so far the only Eurovision Song Contest arranged in Russia.\n\n\nSlava Moscow is a professional rugby club, competing in the national Professional Rugby League. Former rugby league heavyweights RC Lokomotiv have entered the same league as of 2011[update]. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens.\n\n\nIn bandy, one of the most successful clubs in the world is 20 times Russian League champions Dynamo Moscow. They have also won the World Cup thrice and European Cup six times.\n\n\nMFK Dinamo Moskva is one of the major futsal clubs in Europe, having won the Futsal Champions League title once.\n\n\nWhen Russia was selected to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the Luzhniki Stadium got an increased capacity, by almost 10,000 new seats, in addition to a further two stadiums that have been built: the Dynamo Stadium, and the Spartak Stadium, although the first one later was dismissed from having World Cup matches.\n\n\n\n### Football clubs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Club | Founded | League | League Rank | Stadium\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spartak Moscow | 1922 | Premier League | 1st | Otkrytiye Arena |\n| CSKA Moscow | 1911 | Premier League | 1st | VEB Arena |\n| Lokomotiv Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | RZD Arena |\n| Dynamo Moscow | 1923 | Premier League | 1st | VTB Arena |\n| Torpedo Moscow | 1924 | First League | 2nd | Eduard Streltsov Stadium |\n| Rodina Moscow | 2015 | First League | 2nd | Spartakovets Stadium\n |\n| Veles Moscow | 2016 | Second League | 3rd | Avangard Stadium\n |\n\n\n## Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of shopping malls in Moscow\n\n![](image)Arbat Street, in the historical centre of Moscow\nThe city is full of clubs, restaurants, and bars. Tverskaya Street is also one of the busiest shopping streets in Moscow.\n\n\nThe adjoining Tretyakovsky Proyezd, also south of Tverskaya Street, in Kitai-gorod, is host to upmarket boutique stores such as Bulgari, Tiffany & Co., Armani, Prada and Bentley.[143] Nightlife in Moscow has moved on since Soviet times and today the city has many of the world's largest nightclubs.[144] Clubs, bars, creative spaces and restaurants-turned-into-dancefloors are flooding Moscow streets with new openings every year. The hottest area is located around the old chocolate factory, where bars, nightclubs, galleries, cafés and restaurants are placed.[145]\n\n\nDream Island is an amusement park in Moscow that opened on February 29, 2020.[146][147] It is the largest indoor theme park in Europe.\nThe park covers 300,000 square meters. During the park's construction, 150 acres of nature trees unique and rare animals and birds and plants on the peninsula were destroyed. The appearance is in the style of a fairytale castle similar to Disneyland. The park has 29 unique attractions with many rides, as well as pedestrian malls with fountains and cycle paths. The complex includes a landscaped park along with a concert hall, a cinema, a hotel, a children's sailing school, restaurants, and shops.\n\n\n\n## Authorities[edit]\n\n\n### Moscow authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Government of Moscow, Mayor of Moscow, Moscow City Duma, and Charter of the city of Moscow\n\n![](image)Government of Moscow\nAccording to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Moscow is an independent federal subject of the Russian Federation, the so-called city of federal importance.\n\n\nThe Mayor of Moscow is the leading official in the executive, leading the Government of Moscow, which is the highest organ of executive power.\nThe Moscow City Duma is the City Duma (city council or local parliament) and local laws must be approved by it. It includes 45 members who are elected for a five-year term on Single-mandate constituency basis.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2012, direct elections of the mayor were not held due to changes in the Charter of the city of Moscow, the mayor was appointed by presidential decree. The first direct elections from the time of the 2003 vote were to be held after the expiration of the current mayor in 2015, however, in connection with his resignation of his own free will, they took place in September 2013.\n\n\nLocal administration is carried out through eleven prefectures, uniting the districts of Moscow into administrative districts on a territorial basis, and 125 regional administrations. According to the law \"On the organization of local self-government in the city of Moscow\", since the beginning of 2003, the executive bodies of local self-government are municipalities, representative bodies are municipal assemblies, whose members are elected in accordance with the Charter of the intracity municipality.\n\n\n\n### Federal authorities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: White House (Moscow) and State Duma\n\n![](image)The House of the Government of the Russian Federation\nIn Moscow, as in a city endowed with the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the legislative, executive, and judicial federal authorities of the country are located, with the exception of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, which has been located in Saint Petersburg since 2008.\n\n\nThe supreme executive authority - the Government of the Russian Federation - is located in the House of the Government of the Russian Federation on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment in the center of Moscow. The State Duma sits on Okhotny Ryad. The Federation Council is located in a building on Bolshaya Dmitrovka. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation and the Supreme Court of Arbitration of the Russian Federation are also located in Moscow.\n\n\nIn addition, the Moscow Kremlin is the official residence of the President of the Russian Federation. The president's working residence in the Kremlin is located in the Senate Palace.\n\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A BMW 5 Series of the Moscow Police on patrol\nAccording to the ranking of the safest cities made by The Economist Moscow occupies the 37th position with a score of 68,5 points percent.[148] The general level of crime is quite low.[149] More than 170,000 surveillance cameras in Moscow are connected to the facial recognition system. The authorities recognized the successful two-month experiment with automatic recognition of faces, gender, and age of people in real-time - and then they deployed the system to the whole city. The network of video surveillance unites access video cameras (95% of residential apartment buildings in the capital), cameras in the territory and in buildings of schools and kindergartens, at the MCC stations, stadiums, public transport stops, and bus stations, in parks, underground passages.[150]\n\n\nThe emergency numbers are the same as in all the other regions of Russia: 112 is the Single Emergency Number, 101 is the number of the Fire Service and Ministry of Emergency Situations, 102 is the Police one, 103 is the ambulance one, 104 is the Emergency Gas number.[151] Moscow's EMS is the second most efficient one among the world's megacities, as reported by PwC during the presentation of the international study Analysis of EMS Efficiency in Megacities of the World.[152]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Moscow\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Federal city of Moscow\n | ![Coat of arms of Moscow](image) |\n| **City administrative divisions** | 12\n |\n| **City districts** | 125\n |\n| **City settlements** | 21\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Moscow is divided into **12 administrative districts**:\n | ![](image) |\n| 1.

Troitsky Administrative Okrug\n |\n\n\n![](image)Territorial change of Moscow from 1922 to 1995\nThe entire city of Moscow is headed by one mayor (Sergey Sobyanin). The city of Moscow is divided into twelve administrative okrugs and 125 districts.\n\n\nThe Russian capital's town-planning development began to show as early as the 12th century when the city was founded. The central part of Moscow grew by consolidating with suburbs in line with medieval principles of urban development when strong fortress walls would gradually spread along the circle streets of adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence walls set the trajectory of Moscow's rings, laying the groundwork for the future planning of the Russian capital.\n\n\nThe following fortifications served as the city's circular defense boundaries at some point in history: the Kremlin walls, Zemlyanoy Gorod (Earthwork Town), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, and the small railway ring. The Moscow Ring Road (MKAD) has been Moscow's boundary since 1960. Also in the form of a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, and the so-called Third Automobile Ring, which was completed in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle planning continues to define Moscow's further development. However, contemporary Moscow has also engulfed a number of territories outside the MKAD, such as Solntsevo, Butovo, and the town of Zelenograd. A part of Moscow Oblast's territory was merged into Moscow on July 1, 2012; as a result, Moscow is no longer fully surrounded by Moscow Oblast and now also has a border with Kaluga Oblast.[153] In all, Moscow gained about 1,500 square kilometers (580 sq mi) and 230,000 inhabitants. Moscow's Mayor Sergey Sobyanin lauded the expansion that will help Moscow and the neighboring region, a \"mega-city\" of twenty million people, to develop \"harmonically\".[57]\n\n\nAll administrative okrugs and districts have their own coats of arms and flags as well as individual heads of the area.\n\n\nIn addition to the districts, there are Territorial Units with Special Status. These usually include areas with small or no permanent populations. Such is the case with the All-Russia Exhibition Centre, the Botanical Garden, large parks, and industrial zones. In recent years, some territories have been merged with different districts. There are no ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Chinatowns that exist in some North American and East Asian cities. And although districts are not designated by income, as with most cities, those areas that are closer to the city center, metro stations or green zones are considered more prestigious.[154]\n\n\nMoscow also hosts some of the government bodies of Moscow Oblast, although the city itself is not a part of the oblast.[155]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Russia\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Largest private companies basedin Moscow** (ranked by 2019 revenues) |\n| **Moscow** |  | **corporation** |  | **Russia** |\n| 1 |  | Lukoil |  | 1\n |\n| 2 |  | X5 Retail Group |  | 3\n |\n| 3 |  | Novatek |  | 6\n |\n| 4 |  | Nornickel |  | 9\n |\n| 5 |  | UC Rusal |  | 11\n |\n| 6 |  | Sibur |  | 13\n |\n| 7 |  | SUEK |  | 15\n |\n| 8 |  | MTS |  | 17\n |\n| 9 |  | Metalloinvest |  | 18\n |\n| 10 |  | EuroChem |  | 21\n |\n| 11 |  | MegaFon |  | 22\n |\n| 12 |  | M.video |  | 24\n |\n| 13 |  | TMK |  | 25\n |\n| 14 |  | Mechel |  | 26\n |\n| **Source:** *Forbes*[156] |\n\n\n![](image)Moscow International Business Center, one of the largest financial centres of Europe and the world\nMoscow has one of the largest municipal economies in Europe and it accounts more than one-fifth of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP).[157] As of 2021[update], the GRP of Moscow reached almost ₽24.5 trillion(US$332 billion).[158] GMP of Moscow Region was ₽31.3 trillion or around US$425 billion.\n\n\n\n![](image)Moscow Exchange\nThe average gross monthly wage in the city is ₽123,688[159] (US$2,000), which is around twice the national average of ₽66,572 (US$1,000), and one of the highest among the federal subjects of Russia.\n\n\nMoscow is home to the third-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,[160] and has the highest number of billionaires of any city in Europe. It is the financial center of Russia and home to the country's largest banks and many of its largest companies, such as oil giant Rosneft. Moscow accounts for 17% of retail sales in Russia and for 13% of all construction activity in the country.[161][162] Since the 1998 Russian financial crisis, business sectors in Moscow have shown exponential rates of growth. Many new business centers and office buildings have been built in recent years, but Moscow still experiences shortages in office space. As a result, many former industrial and research facilities are being reconstructed to become suitable for office use. Overall, economic stability has improved in recent years; nonetheless, crime and corruption still hinder business development.\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nPrimary industries in Moscow include the chemical, metallurgy, food, textile, furniture, energy production, software development and machinery industries.\n\n\nThe Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant is one of the world's leading producers of military and civil helicopters. Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center produces various space equipment, including modules for space stations Mir, Salyut and the ISS as well as Proton launch vehicles and military ICBMs. Sukhoi, Ilyushin, Mikoyan, Tupolev and Yakovlev aircraft design bureaus also situated in Moscow. NPO Energomash, producing the rocket engines for Russian and American space programs, as well as Lavochkin design bureau, which built fighter planes during WWII, but switched to space probes since the Space Race, are in nearby Khimki, an independent city in Moscow Oblast that have largely been enclosed by Moscow from its sides. Automobile plants ZiL and AZLK, as well as the Voitovich Rail Vehicle plant, are situated in Moscow and Metrovagonmash metro wagon plant is located just outside the city limits. The Poljot Moscow watch factory produces military, professional and sport watches well known in Russia and abroad. Yuri Gagarin in his trip into space used \"Shturmanskie\" produced by this factory.\n\n\nThe Electrozavod factory was the first transformer factory in Russia. The Kristall distillery[163] is the oldest distillery in Russia producing vodka types, including \"Stolichnaya\" while wines are produced at Moscow wine plants, including the Moscow Interrepublican Vinery.[164] The Moscow Jewelry Factory[165] and the Jewellerprom[166] are producers of jewelry in Russia; Jewellerprom used to produce the exclusive Order of Victory, awarded to those aiding the Soviet Union's Red Army during World War II.\n\n\nThere are other industries located just outside the city of Moscow, as well as microelectronic industries in Zelenograd, including Ruselectronics companies.\n\n\nGazprom, the largest extractor of natural gas in the world and the largest Russian company, has head offices also in Moscow, as well as other oil, gas, and electricity companies.\n\n\nMoscow hosts headquarters of the many of telecommunication and technology companies, including 1C, ABBYY, Beeline, Kaspersky Lab, Mail.Ru Group, MegaFon, MTS, Rambler&Co, Rostelecom, Yandex, and Yota.\n\n\nSome industry is being transferred out of the city to improve the ecological state of the city.\n\n\n\n### Cost of living[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hotels in Moscow\n\n![](image)Tretyakovsky Proyezd\n![](image)Nikolskaya Street\n![](image)A microdistrict in Mitino built in the 1990s\nDuring Soviet times, apartments were lent to people by the government according to the square meters-per-person norm (some groups, including people's artists, heroes, and prominent scientists had bonuses according to their honors). Private ownership of apartments was limited until the 1990s when people were permitted to secure property rights to their inhabited places. Since the Soviet era, estate owners have had to pay the service charge for their residences, a fixed amount based on persons per living area.\n\n\nThe price of real estate in Moscow continues to rise. Today, one could expect to pay $4,000 on average per square meter (11 sq ft) on the outskirts of the city[167] or US$6,500–$8,000 per square meter in a prestigious district. The price sometimes may exceed US$40,000 per square meter in a flat.[168][169][170] It costs about US$1,200 per month to rent a one-bedroom apartment and about US$1,000 per month for a studio in the center of Moscow.\n\n\nA typical one-bedroom apartment is about thirty square metres (320 square feet), a typical two-bedroom apartment is forty-five square metres (480 square feet), and a typical three-bedroom apartment is seventy square metres (750 square feet). Many cannot move out of their apartments, especially if a family lives in a two-room apartment originally granted by the state during the Soviet era. Some city residents have attempted to cope with the cost of living by renting their apartments while staying in dachas (country houses) outside the city.\n\n\nIn 2006, Mercer Human Resources Consulting named Moscow the world's most expensive city for expatriate employees, ahead of perennial winner Tokyo, due to the stable Russian ruble as well as increasing housing prices within the city.[171] Moscow also ranked first in the 2007 edition and 2008 edition of the survey. However, Tokyo has overtaken Moscow as the most expensive city in the world, placing Moscow at third behind Osaka in second place.[172]\n\n\nIn 2008, Moscow ranked top on the list of most expensive cities for the third year in a row.[173]\n\n\nIn 2014, according to *Forbes*, Moscow was ranked the 9th most expensive city in the world. *Forbes* ranked Moscow the 2nd most expensive city the year prior.[174]\n\n\nIn 2019 the Economist Intelligence Unit's Worldwide Cost of Living survey put Moscow to 102nd place in the biannual ranking of 133 most expensive cities.[175] ECA International's Cost of Living 2019 Survey ranked Moscow at number 120 among 482 locations worldwide.[176]\n\n\n\n### Public utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Heating[edit]\n\n\nThe heating of buildings in Moscow, like in other cities in Russia is done using central heating system. Before 2004, state unitary enterprises were responsible to produce and supply heat to the clients by the operation of heating stations and heating distribution system of Mosgorteplo, Mosteploenergo, and Teploremontnaladka which gave service to the heating substations in the north-eastern part of the city. Clients were divided between the various enterprises based on their geographical location. A major reform launched in 2004 consolidated the various companies under the umbrella of MIPC which became the municipal heat supplier. Its subsidiaries were the newly transformed Joint-stock companies. The city's main source of heating is the power station of Mosenergo which was reformed in 2005, when around ten subsidiaries were separated from it. One of the newly independent companies was the District Heating Network Company (MTK) (Russian: Московская теплосетевая компания). In 2007 the Government of Moscow bought controlling stakes in the company.[177]\n\n\n\n#### City services[edit]\n\n\n\"Our city\" is a geo-information portal created in 2011 under the mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin with the aim of building a constructive dialogue between Moscow residents and the city's executive authorities. The portal is being developed by the State Public Institution \"New Management Technologies\" together with the Moscow Department of Information Technologies. In its 10 years of operation, more than 1.7 million users have joined the portal, and during this time it has become an effective tool for monitoring the state of urban infrastructure.[178]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Russia\n\n![](image)Moscow State University\nThere are 1,696 high schools in Moscow, as well as 91 colleges.[114] Besides these, there are 222 institutions of higher education, including 60 state universities[114] and the Lomonosov Moscow State University, which was founded in 1755.[179] The main university building located in Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills) is 240 metres (790 ft) tall and when completed, was the tallest building on the continent.[180] The university has over 30,000 undergraduate and 7,000 postgraduate students, who have a choice of twenty-nine faculties and 450 departments for study. Additionally, approximately 10,000 high school students take courses at the university, while over two thousand researchers work. The Moscow State University library contains over nine million books, making it one of the largest libraries in all of Russia. Its acclaim throughout the international academic community has meant that over 11,000 international students have graduated from the university, with many coming to Moscow to become fluent in the Russian language.[181]\n\n\nThe I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University named after Ivan Sechenov or formerly known as Moscow Medical Academy (1stMSMU) is a medical university situated in Moscow, Russia. It was founded in 1785 as the faculty of the Moscow State University. It is a Russian Federal Agency for Health and Social Development. It is one of the largest medical universities in Russia and Europe. More than 9200 students are enrolled in 115 academic departments. It offers courses for post-graduate studies.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University\nThe Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University (formerly known as Russian State Medical University) is a medical higher education institution in Moscow, Russia founded in 1906. It is fully accredited and recognized by Russia's Ministry of Education and Science and is currently under the authority of the Ministry of Health and Social Development. Named after Russian surgeon and pedagogue N.I. Pirogov (1810-1888), it is one of the largest medical institutions and the first university in Russia to allow women to acquire degrees.\n\n\nMoscow is one of the financial centers of the Russian Federation and CIS countries and is known for its business schools. Among them are the Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; The State University of Management, and the National Research University - Higher School of Economics. They offer undergraduate degrees in management, finance, accounting, marketing, real estate, and economic theory, as well as Masters programs and MBAs. Most of them have branches in other regions of Russia and countries around the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The main building of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University\nBauman Moscow State Technical University, founded in 1830, is located in the center of Moscow and provides 18,000 undergraduate and 1,000 postgraduate students with an education in science and engineering, offering technical degrees.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Moscow Conservatory building\nThe Moscow Conservatory,[183] founded in 1866, is a prominent music school in Russia whose graduates include Sergey Rachmaninoff, Alexander Scriabin, Aram Khachaturian, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Alfred Schnittke.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Russian State Institute of Cinematography, the world's oldest  \nfilm school\nThe Gerasimov All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography, abbreviated as VGIK, is the world's oldest educational institution in Cinematography, founded by Vladimir Gardin in 1919.\nSergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Aleksey Batalov were among its most distinguished professors and Mikhail Vartanov, Sergei Parajanov, Andrei Tarkovsky, Nikita Mikhalkov, Eldar Ryazanov, Alexander Sokurov, Yuriy Norshteyn, Aleksandr Petrov, Vasily Shukshin, Konrad Wolf among graduates.\n\n\nMoscow State Institute of International Relations, founded in 1944, remains Russia's best- known school of international relations and diplomacy, with six schools focused on international relations. Approximately 4,500 students make up the university's student body and over 700,000 Russian and foreign-language books—of which 20,000 are considered rare—can be found in the library of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.[184]\n\n\nOther institutions are the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, also known as Phystech, the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex, founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov, the Moscow Aviation Institute, the Moscow Motorway Institute (State Technical University), and the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology has taught numerous Nobel Prize winners, including Pyotr Kapitsa, Nikolay Semyonov, Lev Landau and Alexander Prokhorov, while the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute is known for its research in nuclear physics.[185] The highest Russian military school is the Combined Arms Academy of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.\n\n\nAlthough Moscow has a number of famous Soviet-era higher educational institutions, most of which are more oriented towards engineering or the fundamental sciences, in recent years Moscow has seen a growth in the number of commercial and private institutions that offer classes in business and management. Many state institutions have expanded their education scope and introduced new courses or departments. Institutions in Moscow, as well as the rest of post-Soviet Russia, have begun to offer new international certificates and postgraduate degrees, including the Master of Business Administration. Student exchange programs with numerous countries, specially with the rest of Europe, have also become widespread in Moscow's universities, while schools within the Russian capital also offer seminars, lectures, and courses for corporate employees and businessmen.\n\n\n\n![](image)Russian Academy of Sciences\nMoscow is one of the largest science centers in Russia. The headquarters of the Russian Academy of Sciences are located in Moscow as well as research and applied science institutions. The Kurchatov Institute, Russia's leading research and development institution in the fields of nuclear energy, where the first nuclear reactor in Europe was built, the Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics, Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics, Kapitza Institute for Physical Problems and Steklov Institute of Mathematics are all situated in Moscow.\n\n\nThere are 452 libraries in the city, including 168 for children.[114] The Russian State Library,[186] founded in 1862, is the national library of Russia. The library is home to over 275 km (171 mi) of shelves and 42 million items, including over 17 million books and serial volumes, 13 million journals, 350,000 music scores and sound records, and 150,000 maps, making it the largest library in Russia and one of the largest in the world. Items in 247 languages account for 29% of the collection.[187][188]\n\n\nThe State Public Historical Library, founded in 1863, is the largest library specialising in Russian history. Its collection contains four million items in 112 languages (including 47 languages of the former USSR), mostly on Russian and world history, heraldry, numismatics, and the history of science.[189]\n\n\nIn regard to primary and secondary education, in 2011, Clifford J. Levy of *The New York Times* wrote, \"Moscow has some strong public schools, but the system as a whole is dispiriting, in part because it is being corroded by the corruption that is a post-Soviet scourge. Parents often pay bribes to get their children admitted to better public schools. There are additional payoffs for good grades.\"[190]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Moscow\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Metro\n\n![](image)Moscow Metro route map with planned stations\n![](image)Mayakovskaya station, opened in 1938\nThe Moscow Metro system is famous for its art, murals, mosaics, and ornate chandeliers. It started operation in 1935 and immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that it was a Stalinist device to awe and reward the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Lazar Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilisation as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and the physical prowess of the powerful new \"Homo Sovieticus\" (Soviet man).[191]\n\n\nThe metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order—a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.[192] Soviet workers did the labour and the artwork, but the main engineering designs, routes, and construction plans were handled by specialists recruited from the London Underground. The Britons called for tunneling instead of the \"cut-and-cover\" technique, the use of escalators instead of lifts, and designed the routes and the rolling stock.[193] The paranoia of Stalin and the NKVD was evident when the secret police arrested numerous British engineers for espionage—that is for gaining an in-depth knowledge of the city's physical layout. Engineers for the Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company were given a show trial and deported in 1933, ending the role of British business in the USSR.[194]\n\n\nToday, the Moscow Metro comprises twelve lines, mostly underground with a total of 203 stations. The Metro is one of the deepest subway systems in the world; for instance, the Park Pobedy station, completed in 2003, at 84 metres (276 ft) underground, has the longest escalators in Europe. The Moscow Metro is the busiest metro system in Europe, as well as one of the world's busiest metro systems, serving about ten million passengers daily (300,000,000 people every month).[195] Facing serious transportation problems, Moscow has plans for expanding its Metro. In 2016, the authorities launched a new circle metro railway that contributed to solving transportation issues, namely daily congestion at Koltsevaya Line.[196]\n\n\nDue to the treatment of Metro stations as possible canvas for art, characterized by the fact that workers of Moscow would get to see them every day, many Stalin-era metro stations were built in different \"custom\" designs (where each station's design would be, initially, a massive installation on a certain theme. For example, Elektrozavodskaya station was themed solely after nearby lightbulb factory and ceramic ribbed lightbulb sockets);[197] the tradition of \"Grand Designs\" and, basically, decorating metro stations as single-themed installations, was restored in late 1979.\n\n\nMore recently, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin has introduced comforts ranging from WiFi and USB ports and Apple Pay — while opening new stations at a breakneck pace. Moscow's metro is one of the world's busiest, handling 2.6 billion passengers in 2019.[198]\n\n\nIn the Russian capital, there are over 21.5 thousand Wi-Fi access points, in student dormitories, in parks, cultural and sports institutions, and within the Garden Ring and the Third Transport Ring. From September 2020 to August 2021, 1,700 new access points to urban Wi-Fi were launched in Moscow.[199] The structure of the Wi-Fi network allows citizens to use the Internet without re-authorization.[200]\n\n\n\n### Monorail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moscow Monorail\n\n![](image)Two trains of the Moscow Monorail\nThe Moscow Metro operates a short monorail line (line 13). The line connects Timiryazevskaya metro station and Ulitsa Sergeya Eisensteina, passing close to VDNH (and Line 6 Metro station \"V.D.N.Kh.\"). The line opened in 2004. It accepts overground interchanges, no additional fare is needed if a ride was spent at Moscow Metro within previous 90 minutes.\n\n\n\n### Bus, trolleybus and electric bus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electric buses in Moscow\n\n![](image)Moscow has the largest fleet of electric buses in Europe, with 500 operating as of October 2020[update].[201]\nAs Metro stations outside the city center are far apart in comparison to other cities, up to 4 kilometres (2.5 mi), a bus network radiates from each station to the surrounding residential zones. Moscow has a bus terminal for long-range and intercity passenger buses (Central Bus Terminal) with a daily turnover of about 25 thousand passengers serving about 40% of long-range bus routes in Moscow.[202]\n\n\nEvery major street in the city is served by at least one bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a trolleybus route and have trolley wires over them.\n\n\nWith the total line length of almost 600 kilometres (370 miles) of a single wire, 8 depots, 104 routes, and 1740 vehicles, the Moscow trolleybus system was the largest in the world. But municipal authority, headed by Sergey Sobyanin, began to destroy the trolleybus system in Moscow in 2014 due the planned replacement of trolleybuses by electric buses. In 2018 Moscow trolleybus system has only 4 depots and dozens of kilometers of unused wires. Almost all trolleybus wires inside Garden Ring (Sadovoe Koltso) were cut in 2016–2017 due to the reconstruction of central streets (\"Moya Ulitsa\"). Opened on November 15, 1933, it is also the world's 6th oldest operating trolleybus system.\n\n\nIn 2018 the vehicle companies Kamaz and GAZ have won the Mosgortrans tender for delivering 200 electric buses and 62 ultra-fast charging stations to the city transport system. The manufacturers will be responsible for the quality and reliable operation of the buses and charging stations for the next 15 years. The city will be procuring only electric buses as of 2021, replacing the diesel bus fleet gradually. According to expectations, Moscow will become the leader amongst the European cities in terms of electric and gas fuel share in public transport by 2019.[203]\n\n\nAll bus stations and terminals of Moscow are now connected to free Wi-Fi. One may use it in international bus stations Salaryevo, South Gate and North Gate, and in bus terminals Varshavskaya and Orekhovo. As much as 48 hot spots were installed there.[204]\n\n\n\n### Moscow cable car[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moskva River cable car\n\n![](image)Cable cars passing across the Moskva River and the Luzhniki Stadium\nOn November 26, 2018, the mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony to open the cable car above the Moskva River. The cable car will connect the Luzhniki sports complex with Sparrow Hills and Kosygin Street.\n\n\nThe journey from the well-known viewpoint on Vorobyovy Gory to Luzhniki Stadium will last for five minutes instead of 20 minutes that one would have to spend on the same journey by car. The cable car will work every day from 11 a.m. till 11 p.m.\n\n\nThe cable car is 720 meters (2,360 ft) long. It was built to transport 1,600 passengers per hour in all weathers. There are 35 closed capsules designed by Porsche Design Studio to transport passengers. The booths are equipped with media screens, LED lights, hooks for bikes, skis, and snowboards. Passengers will also be able to use audio guides in English, German, Chinese and Russian.\n\n\n\n### Tram[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Trams in Moscow\n\n![](image)A Vityaz-M tram passing by the Tverskaya Zastava Square\nMoscow has an extensive tram system, which first opened in 1899.[205] The newest line was built in 1984. Its daily usage by Muscovites is low, making up for approximately 5% of trips because many vital connections in the network have been withdrawn. Trams still remain important in some districts as feeders to Metro stations. The trams also provide important cross-links between metro lines, for example between Universitet station of Sokolnicheskaya Line (#1 red line) and Profsoyuznaya station of Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line (#6 orange line) or between Voykovskaya and Strogino. Some routes used to connect downtown with sleep districts, like route 3.\n\n\n\n![](image)Tram map of Moscow\nThere are three tram networks in the city:\n\n\n\n* Krasnopresnenskoye depot network with the westernmost point at Strogino (depot location) and the easternmost point near platform Dmitrovskaya. This network became separated in 1973, but until 1997 it could easily have been reconnected by about one kilometre (fifty chains) of track and three switches. The network has the highest usage in Moscow and no weak points based on turnover except to-depot lane (passengers serviced by bus) and tram ring at Dmitrovskaya (because now it is neither a normal transfer point nor a repair terminal).\n* The Apakov depot services the south-western part from the Varshavsky lane – Simferopolsky boulevard in the east to the Universitet station in the west and Boulevard lane at the center. This network is connected only by the four-way Dubininskaya and Kozhevnicheskaya streets. A second connection by Vostochnaya (Eastern) street was withdrawn in 1987 due to a fire at the Dinamo plant and has not been recovered, and remains lost (Avtozavodsky bridge) at 1992. The network may be serviced anyway by another depot (now route 35, 38).\n* Main three depot networks with railway gate and tram-repair plant.\n\n\nIn addition, tram advocates have suggested that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) would be more effective as at-grade tram lines and that the problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nCommercial taxi services and route taxis are in widespread use. In the mid-2010s, service platforms such as Yandex.Taxi, Uber and Gett displaced many private drivers and small service providers and were in 2015 servicing more than 50% of all taxi orders in Moscow.[206][207]\n\n\nRussian tech firm Yandex is testing self-driving taxis in Moscow. Yandex's fleet of around 170 driverless cars has travelled more than 14 million kilometres. Robotaxis will available through the company's Yandex.Go application in Yasenevo district.[208]\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Komsomolskaya Square known as \"Three Station Square\" thanks to three ornate rail terminal situated there: Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky. Several train stations serve the city. Moscow's ten rail terminals (or *vokzals*) are:\n\n\n* Belorussky Rail Terminal\n* Kazansky Rail Terminal\n* Kiyevsky Rail Terminal\n* Kursky Rail Terminal\n* Leningradsky Rail Terminal\n* Paveletsky Rail Terminal\n* Rizhsky Rail Terminal\n* Savyolovsky Rail Terminal\n* Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal\n* Vostochny railway Terminal\n\n\n![](image)The high-speed Sapsan train links Moscow with Saint Petersburg.\nThe terminals are located close to the city center, along with the metro ringline 5 or close to it, and connect to a metro line to the centre of town. Each station handles trains from different parts of Europe and Asia.[209] There are many smaller railway stations in Moscow. As train tickets are cheap, they are the preferred mode of travel for Russians, especially when departing to Saint Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city. Moscow is the western terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, which traverses nearly 9,300 kilometres (5,800 mi) of Russian territory to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast.\n\n\nSuburbs and satellite cities are connected by commuter elektrichka (electric rail) network. Elektrichkas depart from each of these terminals to the nearby (up to 140 km or 87 mi) large railway stations.\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the Little Ring of the Moscow Railway was converted to be used for frequent passenger service; it is fully integrated with Moscow Metro; the passenger service started on September 10, 2016. A connecting railway line on the North side of the town connects Belorussky terminal with other railway lines. This is used by some suburban trains.\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Circle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\"Lastochka\" train on \"Luzhniki\" station (Line 14)\nThe Moskovskaya Okruzhnaya Zheleznaya Doroga formed a ring around the now-downtown Moscow since 1903, but only served as a non-electrified, fueled locomotive-only railway prior to reconstruction into MCC in 2010's.\n\n\nThe Moscow Central Circle is a 54-kilometre-long (34 mi) urban-metro railway orbital line that encircles historical Moscow. It was built alongside Little Ring of the Moscow Railway, taking some of its tracks into itself as well. M.C.C. was opened for passenger use on September 10, 2016. MOZD is integrated as \"Line 14 of Moscow Metro\", and, while using railway-sized trains, can be perceived as \"S-train-design circle line\".\n\n\nThe line is operated by the Moscow Government owned company MKZD through the Moscow Metro, with the Federal Government owned Russian Railways selected as the operation subcontractor. The track infrastructure and most platforms are owned by Russian Railways, while MKZD owns most station buildings. However, in *S-bahn* way, Moscow unified tickets \"Ediniiy\" and \"Troika\" are accepted by MCC stations. There is one zero-fee interchange for any ticket used on Moscow Metro station less than 90 minutes before entering an MCC station (and vice versa: a passenger of MCC gets 1 free interchange to Moscow Metro within 90 minutes after entering MCC station)\n\n\n\n#### Moscow Central Diameters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An EG2Tv train arriving at the Moscow Belorussky railway station\n![](image)Map of the Moscow Central Diameters\nAnother system, which forms \"genuine *S-Bahn*\" as in \"suburbia-city-suburbia\"-designed railway, is the Moscow Central Diameters, a pass-through railways system, created by constructing bypasses from \"vokzals\" final stations (e.g. by avoiding the central stations of already existing Moscow Railway, used for both intercity and urban-suburban travel before)[210] and forming a train line across Moscow's centre.\n\n\nOut of 5 projected lines, the first 2 lines were completed and launched on 2019-11-21 (e.g. November 21, 2019).\n\n\nWhile using the same rails as \"regular\" suburban trains to vokzals, MCD trains (\"*Ivolga*\" model) got distinguishing features (shape; red cabin, different windows, lesser amount of seats; big red \"MЦΔ\" train logo).\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Intersection at Tverskaya Zastava Square\nThere are over 2.6 million cars in the city daily. Recent years have seen growth in the number of cars, which have caused traffic jams and lack of parking space to become major problems.\n\n\nThe Moscow Ring Road (MKAD), along with the Third Transport Ring and the canceled Fourth Transport Ring, is one of only three freeways that run within Moscow city limits. Several other roadway systems form concentric circles around the city.\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThere are five primary commercial airports serving Moscow: Sheremetyevo (SVO), Domodedovo (DME), Vnukovo (VKO), Zhukovsky (ZIA), Ostafyevo (OSF).\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheremetyevo, the busiest airport in Russia, is ranked as the second-busiest airport in Europe.\nSheremetyevo International Airport is the most globally connected of Moscow's airports, handling 60% of all international flights.[211] It is also a home to all SkyTeam members, and the main hub for Aeroflot (itself a member of SkyTeam). Domodedovo International Airport is the leading airport in Russia in terms of passenger throughput and is the primary gateway to long-haul domestic and CIS destinations and its international traffic rivals Sheremetyevo. It is a hub for S7 airlines, and most of OneWorld and Star Alliance members use Domodedovo as their international hub. Vnukovo International Airport handles flights of Turkish Airlines, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi and others. Ostafyevo International Airport caters primarily to business aviation.\n\n\nMoscow's airports vary in distances from the MKAD beltway: Domodedovo is the farthest at 22 km (14 mi); Vnukovo is 11 km (7 mi); Sheremetyevo is 10 km (6 mi); and Ostafievo, the nearest, is about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from MKAD.[211]\n\n\nThere are a number of smaller airports close to Moscow (19 in Moscow Oblast) such as Myachkovo Airport, that are intended for private aircraft, helicopters and charters.[212]\n\n\n\n### Water[edit]\n\n\nMoscow has two passenger terminals, (South River Terminal and North River Terminal or Rechnoy vokzal), on the river and regular ship routes and cruises along the Moskva and Oka rivers, which are used mostly for entertainment. The North River Terminal, built in 1937, is the main hub for long-range river routes. There are three freight ports serving Moscow.\n\n\n\n### Sharing system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carsharing in Moscow\n\n![](image)As of 2020[update], Moscow has the largest fleet of carsharing vehicles in the world, with more than 30,000 cars.[213]\nMoscow has different vehicle sharing options that are sponsored by the local government. There are several car sharing companies which are in charge of providing cars to the population. To drive the automobiles, the user has to book them through the app of the owning company. In 2018 the mayor Sergey Sobyanin said Moscow's car sharing system has become the biggest in Europe in terms of vehicle fleet.[214] Every day about 25,000 people use this service. In the end of the same year Moscow carsharing became the second in the world in therms of fleet with 16.5K available vehicles.[215] Another sharing system is bike sharing (*Velobike*) of a fleet formed by 3000 traditional and electrical bicycles.[216] The *Delisamokat* is a new sharing service that provides electrical scooters.[217] There are companies that provide different vehicles to the population in proximity to Moscow's big parks.\n\n\n\n### Future development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2020 development concept of Moscow International Business Center and its adjacent territory implies the construction of even more skyscrapers during the period of 2020–2027.[218][219]\nIn 1992, the Moscow government began planning a projected new part of central Moscow, the Moscow International Business Center, with the goal of creating a zone, the first in Russia, and in all of Eastern Europe,[220] that will combine business activity, living space and entertainment. Situated in Presnensky District and located at the Third Ring, the Moscow City area is under intense development. The construction of the MIBC takes place on the Krasnopresnenskaya embankment. The whole project takes up to one square kilometre (250 acres). The area is the only spot in downtown Moscow that can accommodate a project of this magnitude. Today, most of the buildings there are old factories and industrial complexes.\n\n\nThe Federation Tower, completed in 2016, is the second-tallest building in Europe. It is planned to include a water park and other recreational facilities; business, office, entertainment, and residential buildings, a transport network and a new site for the Moscow government. The construction of four new metro stations in the territory has been completed, two of which have opened and two others are reserved for future metro lines crossing MIBC, some additional stations were planned. \n\n\n\n* A rail shuttle service, directly connecting MIBC with the Sheremetyevo International Airport is also planned.\n\n\nMajor thoroughfares through MIBC are the Third Ring and Kutuzovsky Prospekt.\n\n\nThree metro stations were initially planned for the Filyovskaya Line. The station Delovoi Tsentr opened in 2005 and was later renamed Vystavochnaya in 2009. The branch extended to the Mezhdunarodnaya station in 2006, and all work on the third station, Dorogomilovskaya (between Kiyevskaya and Delovoi Tsentr), has been postponed.

Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the most populous urban area in Germany.[3][11] The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region.[12]\n\n\nBerlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes.[13] The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being spoken.\n\n\nFirst documented in the 13th century[7] and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes,[14] Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and liberal revolution. The *Gründerzeit* era's \nindustrialization-induced economic boom multiplied Berlin's population rapidly. Berlin in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the world by population.[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the devastated city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto exclave of West Germany, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (from August 1961 to November 1989) and East German territory.[16] East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\n\n\nBerlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.[17][18][19][20] Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention venues.[21][22] Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination.[23] Significant industries also include information technology, healthcare, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction, electronics, social economy and clean tech.\n\n\nBerlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, Technical University, Free University, University of the Arts, ESMT Berlin, Hertie School, and Bard College Berlin. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With Babelsberg being the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions.[24] The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, and high quality of life.[25]\n\n\nBerlin is also home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Modernism Housing Estates.[26] Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Berlin Wall Memorial, East Side Gallery, Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral, and Berlin Television Tower, the tallest structure in Germany. Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras, and sporting events including Museum Island, the German Historical Museum, Jewish Museum, Natural History Museum, State Library, State Opera, Philharmonic, and the Berlin Marathon.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Berlin\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Berlin.\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![](image) Margraviate of Brandenburg 1237–1618  \n> \n> ![](image) Brandenburg-Prussia 1618–1701  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Prussia 1701–1867  \n> \n> ![Germany](image) North German Confederation 1867–1871  \n> \n> ![](image) German Empire 1871–1918  \n> \n> ![](image) Weimar Republic 1918–1933  \n> \n> ![](image) Nazi Germany 1933–1945  \n> \n> ![](image) Allied-occupied Germany 1945–1949  \n> \n> ![](image) West Germany 1949–1990  \n> \n> ![](image) East Germany 1949–1990  \n> \n> ![](image) Germany 1990–present  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nBerlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River Elbe, that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) Saale (from their confluence at Barby onwards), the eastern border of the Frankish Realm. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons, the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear Slavic-derived names (Germania Slavica). Typical Germanized place name suffixes of Slavic origin are *-ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch* and *-in*, prefixes are **Windisch** and **Wendisch**. The name *Berlin* has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem *berl-/birl-* (\"swamp\").[27] or Proto-Slavic *bьrlogъ*, (lair, den). Since the *Ber-* at the beginning sounds like the German word **Bär** (\"bear\"), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore an example of canting arms.\n\n\nOf Berlin's twelve boroughs, five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Pankow (the most populous), Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Köpenick and Spandau (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, Köpenick, Lankwitz, Lübars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schmöckwitz, Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf. The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French-derived name, and Französisch Buchholz is named after the Huguenots.\n\n\n\n### Prehistory of Berlin[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest human traces in the area of modern Berlin are dated around 60,000 BC.[28] A Mesolithic deer antler mask found in Biesdorf (Berlin) was dated around 9000 BC.[29] During Neolithic times a large number of communities existed in the area and in the Bronze Age up to 1000 people lived in 50 villages. Early Germanic tribes took settlement from 500 BC. Slavic settlements and castles began around 750 AD.[30]\n\n\n\n### 12th to 16th centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Berlin in 1688\n![](image)Berlin Cathedral (left) and Berlin Palace (right), 1900\nThe earliest evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte,[31] and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.[32] The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.[33] The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244.[32] 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.[34] The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes *Via Imperii* and from Bruges to Novgorod.[14] In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.[35][36]\n\n\nIn 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440.[37] During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the \"Berlin Indignation\" (\"Berliner Unwille\").[38][39] This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles, Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.[36] Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power.[40] Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran.[41]\n\n\n\n### 17th to 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nThe Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.[42] Frederick William, known as the \"Great Elector\", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.[43] With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.[44]\n\n\nBy 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.[45] Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.\nSince 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,[47] replacing Königsberg. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, \"Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin\".[35]\n\n\nIn 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740–1786), came to power.[48] Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army.[49] Following France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city.[50] In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg.[51]\n\n\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several others were incorporated into Berlin.[52] In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire.[53] In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.[54]\n\n\n\n### 20th to 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1920s Berlin, West Berlin, and East Berlin\n\nIn the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement.[55] In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin,[56] being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.[57]\n\n\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in Vienna, and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through architecture. Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into World Capital Germania; these were never implemented.[58]\n\n\nNSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were deported to ghettos like Łódź, and to concentration and extermination camps such as Auschwitz.[59]\n\n\nBerlin hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics for which the Olympic stadium was built.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Berlin in ruins after World War II (Potsdamer Platz, 1945)\nDuring World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.[61] After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to Allied-occupied Germany the sectors of the Allies of World War II (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet Union formed East Berlin.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)US and Soviet tanks face each other. Taken in 1961 at Checkpoint Charlie.\n![](image)The Berlin Wall (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.\nAll four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed the Berlin Blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.[63] In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist–Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.\n\n\n\n![](image)The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. On 3 October 1990, the German reunification process was formally finished.\nThe founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn.[64] In 1961, East Germany began to build the Berlin Wall around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. John F. Kennedy gave his \"*Ich bin ein Berliner*\" speech on 26 June 1963, in front of the Schöneberg city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West Berlin.[65] Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.[66]\n\n\nIn 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city.[67] Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim.[68] City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first \"all Berlin\" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.[69] On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified Berlin[70] (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of Gerhard Schröder.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe rebuilt Berlin Palace in 2022\n\nBerlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.[72]\n\n\nIn 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin.[73]\n\n\nIn a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.[74][75]\n\n\nIn 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in Berlin with demonstrations of solidarity against racism, in response to the emergence of far-right politics in Germany.[76]\n\n\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November.[77] Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER's Terminal 5, the former Schönefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year.[78] The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, with the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station expected to open around March 2021, which would complete all new works on the U5.[79]\n\n\nA partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed Berlin Palace, which had been announced in June, was postponed until March 2021.[80] On 16 September 2022, the opening of the eastern wing, the last section of the Humboldt Forum museum, meant the Humboldt Forum museum was finally completed. It became Germany's currently most expensive cultural project.[81]\n\n\n\n### Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fusion of Berlin and Brandenburg\n\n![](image)The coat of arms proposed in the state contract\nThe legal basis for a combined state of Berlin and Brandenburg is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the Basic Law stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law.[82] However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.[83]\n\n\nIn 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg.[84] Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there are over 225.000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to Berlin. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches.[85] Though Berlin voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former West Berlin, Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on Berlin's large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.[84]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Berlin\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Berlin\n![](image)The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.\nBerlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The *Berliner Urstromtal* (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.[86]\n\n\nSubstantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Schöneberg, and Neukölln lie on the Teltow Plateau.\n\n\nThe borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.[87] The Müggelberge at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.[88]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBerlin has an oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*)[89] bordering on a humid continental climate (*Dfb*); one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year.[90][91] This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures but sometimes hot (for being semicontinental) and cold winters but not rigorous most of the time.[92][91]\n\n\n\nDue to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22–25 °C (72–77 °F) and lows of 12–14 °C (54–57 °F). Winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3 °C (37 °F) and lows of −2 to 0 °C (28 to 32 °F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement. Temperatures can be 4 °C (7 °F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.[93] Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.[94] The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0 °C (73.4 °F) and the coldest was January 1709, with a mean temperature of −13.2 °C (8.2 °F).[95] The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1 in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039 in) of rainfall.[96]\n\n| Climate data for Berlin Brandenburg 1991–2020, extremes 1957–2021\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n

history has left the city with a polycentric organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin – the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany – initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\n\nBerlin was devastated by air raids, fires, and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much ornamentation on prewar buildings was destroyed following modernist dogmas, and in both postwar systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed, including the *Forum Fridericianum* along with, the State Opera (1955), Charlottenburg Palace (1957), the monumental buildings on Gendarmenmarkt (1980s), Kommandantur (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the City Palace. Many new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as Hotel Adlon.\n\n\nClusters of towers rise at various locations: Potsdamer Platz, the City West, and Alexanderplatz, the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has five of the top 50 tallest buildings in Germany.\n\n\nOver one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands, and water.[13] Berlin's second-largest and most popular park, the Großer Tiergarten, is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from Bahnhof Zoo in the City West to the Brandenburg Gate in the east.\n\n\nAmong famous streets, Unter den Linden and Friedrichstraße are found in the city's historic heart (and were included in the former East Berlin). Some major streets in City West are Kurfürstendamm (or just Ku´damm) and Kantstraße.\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Berlin\n\nFurther information: List of sights in Berlin and List of tallest buildings in Berlin\n\n![](image)Panorama of the Gendarmenmarkt, showing the Konzerthaus Berlin, flanked by the German Church (left) and French Church (right)\n![](image)The Berlin Cathedral at Museum Island\n![](image)The TV Tower (Berliner Fernsehturm)\nThe Fernsehturm (TV tower) at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368 m (1,207 ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons, personifications of the four main Prussian rivers, and Neptune on top of it.\n\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\n\nThe East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\n\nThe Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the Französischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\n\n\n![](image)Charlottenburg Palace\n![](image)Hackesche Höfe\nThe Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the Stadtschloss continues.[104][105] Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is Berlin Cathedral, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. St. Hedwig's Cathedral is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.\n\n\n\n![](image)Breitscheidplatz with Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is the center of City West.\nUnter den Linden is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of Humboldt University is there. Friedrichstraße was Berlin's legendary street during the Golden Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.\n\n\nPotsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down.[106] To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gemäldegalerie, and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berliner Philharmonie. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.[107]\n\n\nThe area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture.\n\n\nThe Straße des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegessäule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\n\nThe Kurfürstendamm is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The Rathaus Schöneberg, where John F. Kennedy made his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\" speech, is in Tempelhof-Schöneberg.\n\n\nWest of the center, Bellevue Palace is the residence of the German President. Charlottenburg Palace, which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\n\nThe Funkturm Berlin is a 150-meter-tall (490 ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\n\nThe Oberbaumbrücke over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 Berlin U-Bahn line. The bridge was completed in a brick gothic style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the Red Army from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a checkpoint and border crossing between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Berlin\n\n![](image)Berlin population pyramid in 2022\n![](image)Berlin's population, 1880–2012\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75 million registered inhabitants[108] in an area of 891.1 km2 (344.1 sq mi).[1] The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km2. Berlin is the most populous city proper in the European Union. In 2019, the urban area of Berlin had about 4.5 million inhabitants.[3] As of 2019[update], the functional urban area was home to about 5.2 million people.[109] The entire Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has a population of more than 6 million in an area of 30,546 km2 (11,794 sq mi).[110][1]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1721 | 65,300 | —     |\n| 1750 | 113,289 | +73.5% |\n| 1800 | 172,132 | +51.9% |\n| 1815 | 197,717 | +14.9% |\n| 1825 | 220,277 | +11.4% |\n| 1840 | 330,230 | +49.9% |\n| 1852 | 438,958 | +32.9% |\n| 1861 | 547,571 | +24.7% |\n| 1871 | 826,341 | +50.9% |\n| 1880 | 1,122,330 | +35.8% |\n| 1890 | 1,578,794 | +40.7% |\n| 1900 | 1,888,848 | +19.6% |\n| 1910 | 2,071,257 | +9.7% |\n| 1920 | 3,879,409 | +87.3% |\n| 1925 | 4,082,778 | +5.2% |\n| 1933 | 4,221,024 | +3.4% |\n| 1939 | 4,330,640 | +2.6% |\n| 1945 | 3,064,629 | −29.2% |\n| 1950 | 3,336,026 | +8.9% |\n| 1960 | 3,274,016 | −1.9% |\n| 1970 | 3,208,719 | −2.0% |\n| 1980 | 3,048,759 | −5.0% |\n| 1990 | 3,433,695 | +12.6% |\n| 2000 | 3,382,169 | −1.5% |\n| 2010 | 3,460,725 | +2.3% |\n| 2020 | 3,664,088 | +5.9% |\n| 2022 | 3,755,251 | +2.5% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2014, the city-state Berlin had 37,368 live births (+6.6%), a record number since 1991. The number of deaths was 32,314. Almost 2.0 million households were counted in the city. 54 percent of them were single-person households. More than 337,000 families with children under the age of 18 lived in Berlin. In 2014, the German capital registered a migration surplus of approximately 40,000 people.[111]\n\n\n\n### Nationalities[edit]\n\n\n\n\nResidents by Citizenship (31 June 2022)[108]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2,958,786\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 99,421\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 53,664\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 49,280\n |\n| ![](image) Syria | 44,324\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 32,362\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | 32,170\n |\n| ![](image) Russian Federation | 30,590\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 27,128\n |\n| ![](image) India | 23,771\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 22,858\n |\n| ![](image) USA | 20,990\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia | 20,567\n |\n| ![](image) France | 19,241\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 17,481\n |\n\n\nNational and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.\n\n\nActive immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents,[108] making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.[112] In the 1990s the *Aussiedlergesetze* enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.[113] The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.[114] A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel.[115] Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.[116]\n\n\nIn December 2019 there were 777,345 registered residents of foreign nationality and another 542,975 German citizens with a \"migration background\" *(Migrationshintergrund, MH)*,[108] meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955. Foreign residents of Berlin originate from about 190 countries.[117] 48 percent of the residents under the age of 15 have a migration background in 2017.[118] Berlin in 2009 was estimated to have 100,000 to 250,000 unregistered inhabitants.[119] Boroughs of Berlin with a significant number of migrants or foreign born population are Mitte, Neukölln and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.[120] The number of Arabic speakers in Berlin could be higher than 150,000. There are at least 40,000 Berliners with Syrian citizenship, third only behind Turkish and Polish citizens. The 2015 refugee crisis made Berlin Europe's capital of Arab culture.[121] Berlin is among the cities in Germany that have received the biggest amount of refugees after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of November 2022, an estimated 85,000 Ukrainian refugees were registered in Berlin,[122] making Berlin the most popular destination of Ukrainian refugees in Germany.[123]\n\n\nBerlin has a vibrant expatriate community involving precarious immigrants, illegal immigrants, seasonal workers, and refugees. Therefore Berlin sustains a broad variety of English-based speakers. Speaking a particular type of English does attract prestige and cultural capital in Berlin.[124]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German language and Berlinerisch dialect\n\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,[125] and one of the three working languages of the European Commission.\n\n\nBerlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Brandenburgish variant. The dialect is now seen more like a sociolect, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak standard German in everyday life.\n\n\nThe most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.[126]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Berlin\n\nReligion in Berlin (2018)[127]\n\n\n\nNot religious/other (67.4%)\nEKD Protestants (13.4%)\nCatholics (7.8%)\nIslam (8.5%)\nJewish (1%)\nOther (1%)\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nClockwise from top left: Berlin Cathedral, New Synagogue, Şehitlik Mosque, and St. Hedwig's Cathedral\n\nOn the report of the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.[128]\n\n\nThe largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the Protestant regional church body—the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)—a united church. EKBO is a member of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) and of the Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD (UEK). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the Roman Catholic Church had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members.[129] About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly Eastern Orthodox, but also various Protestants).[130] According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church.[108] The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects church tax on behalf of the churches. It does not keep records of members of other religious organizations which may collect their own church tax, in this way.\n\n\nIn 2009, approximately 249,000 Muslims were reported by the Office of Statistics to be members of mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin,[131] while in 2016, the newspaper *Der Tagesspiegel* estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed Ramadan in Berlin.[132] In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.[108][133] Between 1992 and 2011 the Muslim population almost doubled.[134]\n\n\nAbout 0.9% of Berliners belong to other religions. Of the estimated population of 30,000–45,000 Jewish residents,[135] approximately 12,000 are registered members of religious organizations.[130]\n\n\nBerlin is the seat of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Berlin and EKBO's elected chairperson is titled the bishop of EKBO. Furthermore, Berlin is the seat of many Orthodox cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptist, one of the two seats of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Western and Central Europe, and the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral of the Diocese of Berlin (Patriarchate of Moscow).\n\n\nThe faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many places of worship in Berlin. The Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church has eight parishes of different sizes in Berlin.[136] There are 36 Baptist congregations (within Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany), 29 New Apostolic Churches, 15 United Methodist churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four Churches of Christ, Scientist (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Old Catholic church, and an Anglican church in Berlin. Berlin has more than 80 mosques,[137] ten synagogues,[138] and two Buddhist temples.\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Berlin and Berlin Police\n\n### German Federal city state[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rotes Rathaus (*Red City Hall*), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin\nSince the German reunification on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three city-states of Germany among the present 16 federal states of Germany. The Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin (*House of Representatives*) functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the Senate of Berlin (*Senat von Berlin*). The Senate consists of the Governing Mayor of Berlin (*Regierender Bürgermeister*), and up to ten senators holding ministerial positions, two of them holding the title of \"Mayor\" (*Bürgermeister*) as deputy to the Governing Mayor.[139]\n\n\nThe total annual budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.[140] The German Federal city state of Berlin owns extensive assets, including administrative and government buildings, real estate companies, as well as stakes in the Olympic Stadium, swimming pools, housing companies, and numerous public enterprises and subsidiary companies.[141][142]\n\n\nThe Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the 2001 state election and won another term in the 2006 state election.[143] From the 2016 state election until the 2023 state election, there was a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party. Since April 2023, the government has been formed by a coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.[144]\n\n\nThe Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (*Oberbürgermeister der Stadt*) and Minister President of the State of Berlin (*Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes*). The office of the Governing Mayor is in the Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Since 2023, this office has been held by Kai Wegner of the Christian Democrats.[145] He is the first conservative mayor in Berlin in more than two decades.[146]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin\n\n![](image)Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods\nBerlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (*Bezirke*). Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (*Ortsteile*), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called *Kiez*. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (*Bezirksamt*) consisting of five councilors (*Bezirksstadträte*) including the borough's mayor (*Bezirksbürgermeister*). The council is elected by the borough assembly (*Bezirksverordnetenversammlung*). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (*Rat der Bürgermeister*), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.\n\n\n\n### City partnerships[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany\n\nBerlin to this day maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.[147] Town twinning between West Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles, California in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification.\n\n\n\n### Capital city[edit]\n\n\nBerlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The President of Germany, whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the German constitution, has their official residence in Bellevue Palace.[148] Berlin is the seat of the German Chancellor (Prime Minister), housed in the Chancellery building, the *Bundeskanzleramt*. Facing the Chancellery is the Bundestag, the German Parliament, housed in the renovated Reichstag building since the government's relocation to Berlin in 1998. The Bundesrat (\"federal council\", performing the function of an upper house) is the representation of the 16 constituent states (*Länder*) of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian House of Lords. The total annual federal budget managed by the German government exceeded €310 ($375) billion in 2013.[149]\n\n\n\n* ![The Federal Chancellery building, seat of the Chancellor of Germany](image)\n\nThe Federal Chancellery building, seat of the Chancellor of Germany\n* ![The Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag](image)\n\nThe Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag\n* ![Schloss Bellevue, seat of the President of Germany](image)\n\nSchloss Bellevue, seat of the President of Germany\n* ![Prussian House of Lords, seat of the Bundesrat of Germany](image)\n\nPrussian House of Lords, seat of the Bundesrat of Germany\n* ![Headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service](image)\n\nHeadquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service\n\n\nThe relocation of the federal government and Bundestag to Berlin was mostly completed in 1999. However, some ministries, as well as some minor departments, stayed in the federal city Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. Discussions about moving the remaining ministries and departments to Berlin continue.[150] The Federal Foreign Office and the ministries and departments of Defense, Justice and Consumer Protection, Finance, Interior, Economic Affairs and Energy, Labor and Social Affairs, Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Food and Agriculture, Economic Cooperation and Development, Health, Transport and Digital Infrastructure and Education and Research are based in the capital.\n\n\nBerlin hosts in total 158 foreign embassies[151] as well as the headquarters of many think tanks, trade unions, nonprofit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations. Due to the influence and international partnerships of the Federal Republic of Germany, the capital city has become a significant center of German and European affairs. Frequent official visits and diplomatic consultations among governmental representatives and national leaders are common in contemporary Berlin.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Berlin\n\n![](image)Berlin is a UNESCO \"City of Design\" and recognized for its creative industries and startup ecosystem.[152]\nIn 2018, the GDP of Berlin totaled €147 billion, an increase of 3.1% over the previous year.[1] Berlin's economy is dominated by the service sector, with around 84% of all companies doing business in services.

Destinations in Germany and Europe are connected via the intercity bus exchange *Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof Berlin*.\n\n\n\n### Urban public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Berlin U-Bahn (Metro) at Heidelberger Platz station\n![](image)Alexanderplatz U-bahn Station\nThe *Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe* (BVG) and the German State-owned Deutsche Bahn (DB) manage several extensive urban public transport systems.[189]\n\n\n\n\n\n| System\n | Stations / Lines / Net length\n | Annual ridership\n | Operator / Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| S-Bahn | 166 / 16 / 331 km (206 mi)\n | 431,000,000 (2016) | DB / Mainly overground rapid transit rail system with suburban stops\n |\n| U-Bahn | 173 / 9 / 146 km (91 mi)\n | 563,000,000 (2017) | BVG / Mainly underground rail system / 24h-service on weekends\n |\n| Tram | 404 / 22 / 194 km (121 mi)\n | 197,000,000 (2017) | BVG / Operates predominantly in eastern boroughs\n |\n| Bus | 3227 / 198 / 1,675 km (1,041 mi)\n | 440,000,000 (2017) | BVG / Extensive services in all boroughs / 62 Night Lines\n |\n| Ferry | 6 lines\n |  | BVG / Transportation as well as recreational ferries\n |\n\n\nPublic transport in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20th-century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since 1989, the transport network has been developed extensively. However, it still contains early 20th century traits, such as the U1.[190]\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berlin Brandenburg Airport\n![](image)Airports in Berlin, including those that are no longer used (as of November 2020)\n![](image)Typical cycle street in Prenzlauer Berg\nBerlin is served by one commercial international airport: Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing Tegel Airport (TXL) and Schönefeld Airport (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.[191] Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.[192] The planned initial capacity of around 27 million passengers per year[193] is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.[194]\n\n\nBefore the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as the BER. Both airports together handled 29.5 million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.[195] Tegel Airport was a focus city for Lufthansa and Eurowings while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like Germania, easyJet and Ryanair. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller Tempelhof Airport, which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park.\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cycling in Berlin\n\nBerlin is well known for its highly developed bicycle lane system.[196] It is estimated Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Around 500,000 daily bike riders accounted for 13 percent of total traffic in 2010.[197] Cyclists have access to 620 km (385 mi) of bicycle paths including approximately 150 km (93 mi) of mandatory bicycle paths, 190 km (118 mi) of off-road bicycle routes, 60 km (37 mi) of bicycle lanes on roads, 70 km (43 mi) of shared bus lanes which are also open to cyclists, 100 km (62 mi) of combined pedestrian/bike paths and 50 km (31 mi) of marked bicycle lanes on roadside pavements (or sidewalks).[198] Riders are allowed to carry their bicycles on Regionalbahn, S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains, on trams, and on night buses if a bike ticket is purchased.[199]\n\n\n\n## Rohrpost[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rohrpost in Berlin\n\nFrom 1865 to 1976, Berlin operated an expansive pneumatic postal network, reaching a maximum length of 400 kilometers (roughly 250 miles) by 1940. The system was divided into two distinct networks after 1949. The West Berlin system remained in public use until 1963, and continued to be utilized for government correspondence until 1972. Conversely, the East Berlin system, which incorporated the *Hauptelegraphenamt*—the central hub of the operation—remained functional until 1976.\n\n\n\n## Energy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant\nBerlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm Vattenfall and the Berlin-based company GASAG. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern Brandenburg.[200]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update] the five largest power plants measured by capacity are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these power stations generate electricity and useful heat at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.\n\n\nIn 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban Autobahn, use overhead lines. The Berlin 380-kV electric line is the backbone of the city's energy grid.\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Charité university hospital\nBerlin has a long history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.[201] The modern history of medicine has been significantly influenced by scientists from Berlin. Rudolf Virchow was the founder of cellular pathology, while Robert Koch developed vaccines for anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis.[202]\n\n\nThe Charité complex (Universitätsklinik Charité) is the largest university hospital in Europe, tracing back its origins to the year 1710. More than half of all German Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, including Emil von Behring, Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich, have worked at the Charité. The Charité is spread over four campuses and comprises around 3,000 beds, 15,500 staff, 8,000 students, and more than 60 operating theaters, and it has a turnover of two billion euros annually.[203] The Charité is a joint institution of the Freie Universität Berlin and the Humboldt University of Berlin, including a wide range of institutes and specialized medical centers.\n\n\n\n## Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radio and telecommunication in Berlin\n\n![](image)Café customers in Berlin Mitte using Wi-Fi devices\nSince 2017, the digital television standard in Berlin and Germany is DVB-T2. This system transmits compressed digital audio, digital video and other data in an MPEG transport stream.\n\n\nBerlin has installed several hundred free public Wireless LAN sites across the capital since 2016. The wireless networks are concentrated mostly in central districts; 650 hotspots (325 indoor and 325 outdoor access points) are installed.[204]\n\n\nThe UMTS (3G) and LTE (4G) networks of the three major cellular operators Vodafone, T-Mobile and O2 enable the use of mobile broadband applications citywide.\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Berlin\n\n![](image)The Humboldt University of Berlin is affiliated with 57 Nobel Prize winners.\nAs of 2014[update], Berlin had 878 schools, teaching 340,658 students in 13,727 classes and 56,787 trainees in businesses and elsewhere.[156] The city has a 6-year primary education program. After completing primary school, students continue to the *Sekundarschule* (a comprehensive school) or *Gymnasium* (college preparatory school). Berlin has a special bilingual school program in the *Europaschule*, in which children are taught the curriculum in German and a foreign language, starting in primary school and continuing in high school.[205]\n\n\nThe Französisches Gymnasium Berlin, which was founded in 1689 to teach the children of Huguenot refugees, offers (German/French) instruction.[206] The John F. Kennedy School, a bilingual German–American public school in Zehlendorf, is particularly popular with children of diplomats and the English-speaking expatriate community. 82 *Gymnasien* teach Latin[207] and 8 teach Classical Greek.[208]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Universities and research institutions in Berlin\n\n![](image)The Free University of Berlin\nThe Berlin-Brandenburg capital region is one of the most prolific centers of higher education and research in Germany and Europe. Historically, 67 Nobel Prize winners are affiliated with the Berlin-based universities.\n\n\nThe city has four public research universities and more than 30 private, professional, and technical colleges *(Hochschulen)*, offering a wide range of disciplines.[209] A record number of 175,651 students were enrolled in the winter term of 2015/16.[210] Among them around 18% have an international background.\n\n\nThe three largest universities combined have approximately 103,000 enrolled students. There are the Freie Universität Berlin *(Free University of Berlin, FU Berlin)* with about 33,000[211] students, the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin *(HU Berlin)* with 35,000[212] students, and the Technische Universität Berlin *(TU Berlin)* with 35,000[213] students. The Charité Medical School has around 8,000 students.[203] The FU, the HU, the TU, and the Charité make up the Berlin University Alliance, which has received funding from the Excellence Strategy program of the German government.[214][215] The Universität der Künste *(UdK)* has about 4,000 students and ESMT Berlin is only one of four business schools in Germany with triple accreditation.[216] The Hertie School, a private public policy school located in Mitte, has more than 900 students and doctoral students.

It partners with major multinational companies such as Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, and SAP.[219]\n\n\nOne of Europe's successful research, business and technology clusters is based at WISTA in Berlin-Adlershof, with more than 1,000 affiliated firms, university departments and scientific institutions.[220]\n\n\nIn addition to the university-affiliated libraries, the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin is a major research library. Its two main locations are on Potsdamer Straße and on Unter den Linden. There are also 86 public libraries in the city.[156] ResearchGate, a global social networking site for scientists, is based in Berlin.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture in Berlin\n\n![](image)The Alte Nationalgalerie is part of the Museum Island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n![](image)The alternative culture Holzmarkt\nBerlin is known for its numerous cultural institutions, many of which enjoy international reputation.[26][221] The diversity and vivacity of the metropolis led to a trendsetting atmosphere.[222] An innovative music, dance and art scene has developed in the 21st century.\n\n\nYoung people, international artists and entrepreneurs continued to settle in the city and made Berlin a popular entertainment center in the world.[223]\n\n\nThe expanding cultural performance of the city was underscored by the relocation of the Universal Music Group who decided to move their headquarters to the banks of the River Spree.[224] In 2005, Berlin was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO and has been part of the Creative Cities Network ever since.[225][22]\n\n\nMany German and International films were shot in Berlin, including M, One, Two, Three, Cabaret, Christiane F., Possession, Octopussy, Wings of Desire, Run Lola Run, The Bourne Trilogy, Good Bye, Lenin!, The Lives of Others, Inglourious Basterds, Hanna, Unknown and Bridge of Spies.\n\n\n\n### Galleries and museums[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of museums and galleries in Berlin.\n\n![](image)The Jewish Museum presents two millennia of German–Jewish history.\nAs of 2011[update] Berlin is home to 138 museums and more than 400 art galleries.[156]\n[226] The ensemble on the Museum Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is in the northern part of the Spree Island between the Spree and the Kupfergraben.[26] As early as 1841 it was designated a \"district dedicated to art and antiquities\" by a royal decree. Subsequently, the Altes Museum was built in the Lustgarten. The Neues Museum, which displays the bust of Queen Nefertiti,[227] Alte Nationalgalerie, Pergamon Museum, and Bode Museum were built there.\n\n\nApart from the Museum Island, there are many additional museums in the city. The Gemäldegalerie (Painting Gallery) focuses on the paintings of the \"old masters\" from the 13th to the 18th centuries, while the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery, built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe) specializes in 20th-century European painting. The Hamburger Bahnhof, in Moabit, exhibits a major collection of modern and contemporary art. The expanded Deutsches Historisches Museum reopened in the Zeughaus with an overview of German history spanning more than a millennium. The Bauhaus Archive is a museum of 20th-century design from the famous Bauhaus school.

A private museum venture exhibits a comprehensive documentation of detailed plans and strategies devised by people who tried to flee from the East.\n\n\nThe Beate Uhse Erotic Museum claimed to be the largest erotic museum in the world until it closed in 2014.[233][234]\n\n\nThe cityscape of Berlin displays large quantities of urban street art.[235] It has become a significant part of the city's cultural heritage and has its roots in the graffiti scene of Kreuzberg of the 1980s.[236] The Berlin Wall itself has become one of the largest open-air canvasses in the world.[237] The leftover stretch along the Spree river in Friedrichshain remains as the East Side Gallery. Berlin today is consistently rated as an important world city for street art culture.[238]\nBerlin has galleries which are quite rich in contemporary art. Located in Mitte, KW Institute for Contemporary Art, KOW, Sprüth Magers; Kreuzberg there are a few galleries as well such as Blain Southern, Esther Schipper, Future Gallery, König Gallerie.\n\n\n\n### Nightlife and festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Berlinale is the largest international spectator film festival.\nBerlin's nightlife has been celebrated as one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind.[239][240] In the 1970s and 80s, the SO36 in Kreuzberg was a center for punk music and culture. The *SOUND* and the *Dschungel* gained notoriety. Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in Western and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and counterculture gatherings.[241] The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, Tresor and Berghain. The KitKatClub and several other locations are known for their sexually uninhibited parties.\n\n\nClubs are not required to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning or even all weekend. The *Weekend Club* near Alexanderplatz features a roof terrace that allows partying at night. Several venues have become a popular stage for the Neo-Burlesque scene.\n\n\n\n![](image)The French Cathedral during the annual Festival of Lights\n![](image)Hanukkah festival at the Brandenburg Gate\nBerlin has a long history of gay culture, and is an important birthplace of the LGBT rights movement. Same-sex bars and dance halls operated freely as early as the 1880s, and the first gay magazine, *Der Eigene*, started in 1896. By the 1920s, gays and lesbians had an unprecedented visibility.[242][243] Today, in addition to a positive atmosphere in the wider club scene, the city again has a huge number of queer clubs and festivals. The most famous and largest are Berlin Pride, the Christopher Street Day,[244] the Lesbian and Gay City Festival in Berlin-Schöneberg, the Kreuzberg Pride and Hustlaball.\n\n\nThe annual Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) with around 500,000 admissions is considered to be the largest publicly attended film festival in the world.[245][246] The Karneval der Kulturen (*Carnival of Cultures*), a multi-ethnic street parade, is celebrated every Pentecost weekend.[247] Berlin is also well known for the cultural festival Berliner Festspiele, which includes the jazz festival JazzFest Berlin, and Young Euro Classic, the largest international festival of youth orchestras in the world.

For Berlin's independent dance and theatre scene, venues such as the Sophiensäle in Mitte and the three houses of the Hebbel am Ufer (HAU) in Kreuzberg are important. Most productions there are also accessible to an English-speaking audience. Some of the dance and theatre groups that also work internationally (Gob Squad, Rimini Protokoll) are based there, as well as festivals such as the international festival Dance in August.\n\n\nBerlin has three major opera houses: the Deutsche Oper, the Berlin State Opera, and the Komische Oper. The Berlin State Opera on Unter den Linden opened in 1742 and is the oldest of the three. Its musical director is Daniel Barenboim.

Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the most populous urban area in Germany.[3][11] The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has around 6.2 million inhabitants and is Germany's second-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr region.[12]\n\n\nBerlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals, and lakes.[13] The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being spoken.\n\n\nFirst documented in the 13th century[7] and at the crossing of two important historic trade routes,[14] Berlin became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1417–1701), Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1918), German Empire (1871–1918), Weimar Republic (1919–1933), and Nazi Germany (1933–1945). Berlin has served as a scientific, artistic and philosophical hub of the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, and liberal revolution. The *Gründerzeit* era's \nindustrialization-induced economic boom multiplied Berlin's population rapidly. Berlin in the roaring 1920s was the third-largest city in the world by population.[15]\n\n\nAfter World War II and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the devastated city was divided; West Berlin became a de facto exclave of West Germany, surrounded by the Berlin Wall (from August 1961 to November 1989) and East German territory.[16] East Berlin was declared capital of East Germany, while Bonn became the West German capital. Following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.\n\n\nBerlin is a world city of culture, politics, media and science.[17][18][19][20] Its economy is based on high-tech firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of creative industries, startup companies, research facilities, media corporations, and convention venues.[21][22] Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular tourist destination.[23] Significant industries also include information technology, healthcare, biomedical engineering, biotechnology, automotive, construction, electronics, social economy and clean tech.\n\n\nBerlin is home to world-renowned universities such as the Humboldt University, Technical University, Free University, University of the Arts, ESMT Berlin, Hertie School, and Bard College Berlin. Its Zoological Garden is the most visited zoo in Europe and one of the most popular worldwide. With Babelsberg being the world's first large-scale movie studio complex, Berlin is an increasingly popular location for international film productions.[24] The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts, and high quality of life.[25]\n\n\nBerlin is also home to three World Heritage Sites: Museum Island; the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin; and the Modernism Housing Estates.[26] Other landmarks include the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag building, Potsdamer Platz, Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, Berlin Wall Memorial, East Side Gallery, Berlin Victory Column, Berlin Cathedral, and Berlin Television Tower, the tallest structure in Germany. Berlin has numerous museums, galleries, libraries, orchestras, and sporting events including Museum Island, the German Historical Museum, Jewish Museum, Natural History Museum, State Library, State Opera, Philharmonic, and the Berlin Marathon.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Berlin\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Berlin.\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![](image) Margraviate of Brandenburg 1237–1618  \n> \n> ![](image) Brandenburg-Prussia 1618–1701  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Prussia 1701–1867  \n> \n> ![Germany](image) North German Confederation 1867–1871  \n> \n> ![](image) German Empire 1871–1918  \n> \n> ![](image) Weimar Republic 1918–1933  \n> \n> ![](image) Nazi Germany 1933–1945  \n> \n> ![](image) Allied-occupied Germany 1945–1949  \n> \n> ![](image) West Germany 1949–1990  \n> \n> ![](image) East Germany 1949–1990  \n> \n> ![](image) Germany 1990–present  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nBerlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River Elbe, that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) Saale (from their confluence at Barby onwards), the eastern border of the Frankish Realm. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by Germanic tribes like the Franks and the Saxons, the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by Slavic tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear Slavic-derived names (Germania Slavica). Typical Germanized place name suffixes of Slavic origin are *-ow, -itz, -vitz, -witz, -itzsch* and *-in*, prefixes are **Windisch** and **Wendisch**. The name *Berlin* has its roots in the language of West Slavic inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old Polabian stem *berl-/birl-* (\"swamp\").[27] or Proto-Slavic *bьrlogъ*, (lair, den). Since the *Ber-* at the beginning sounds like the German word **Bär** (\"bear\"), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore an example of canting arms.\n\n\nOf Berlin's twelve boroughs, five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Pankow (the most populous), Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Treptow-Köpenick and Spandau (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: Altglienicke, Alt-Treptow, Britz, Buch, Buckow, Gatow, Karow, Kladow, Köpenick, Lankwitz, Lübars, Malchow, Marzahn, Pankow, Prenzlauer Berg, Rudow, Schmöckwitz, Spandau, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, Steglitz, Tegel and Zehlendorf. The neighborhood of Moabit bears a French-derived name, and Französisch Buchholz is named after the Huguenots.\n\n\n\n### Prehistory of Berlin[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest human traces in the area of modern Berlin are dated around 60,000 BC.[28] A Mesolithic deer antler mask found in Biesdorf (Berlin) was dated around 9000 BC.[29] During Neolithic times a large number of communities existed in the area and in the Bronze Age up to 1000 people lived in 50 villages. Early Germanic tribes took settlement from 500 BC. Slavic settlements and castles began around 750 AD.[30]\n\n\n\n### 12th to 16th centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Berlin in 1688\n![](image)Berlin Cathedral (left) and Berlin Palace (right), 1900\nThe earliest evidence of middle age settlements in the area of today's Berlin are remnants of a house foundation dated to 1174, found in excavations in Berlin Mitte,[31] and a wooden beam dated from approximately 1192.[32] The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920.[33] The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Cölln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244.[32] 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.[34] The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the staple right on the two important trade routes *Via Imperii* and from Bruges to Novgorod.[14] In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.[35][36]\n\n\nIn 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440.[37] During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as German emperors. In 1443, Frederick II Irontooth started the construction of a new royal palace in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the \"Berlin Indignation\" (\"Berliner Unwille\").[38][39] This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector Albrecht III Achilles, Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.[36] Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when John Cicero came to power.[40] Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became Lutheran.[41]\n\n\n\n### 17th to 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nThe Thirty Years' War between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population.[42] Frederick William, known as the \"Great Elector\", who had succeeded his father George William as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance.[43] With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French Huguenots.[44]\n\n\nBy 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration.[45] Many other immigrants came from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Berlin became the capital of the German Empire in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.\nSince 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in personal union with the Duchy of Prussia. In 1701, the dual state formed the Kingdom of Prussia, as Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg, crowned himself as king Frederick I in Prussia. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,[47] replacing Königsberg. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, \"Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin\".[35]\n\n\nIn 1740, Frederick II, known as Frederick the Great (1740–1786), came to power.[48] Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of the Enlightenment, but also, was briefly occupied during the Seven Years' War by the Russian army.[49] Following France's victory in the War of the Fourth Coalition, Napoleon Bonaparte marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city.[50] In 1815, the city became part of the new Province of Brandenburg.[51]\n\n\nThe Industrial Revolution transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic center of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861, neighboring suburbs including Wedding, Moabit and several others were incorporated into Berlin.[52] In 1871, Berlin became capital of the newly founded German Empire.[53] In 1881, it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.[54]\n\n\n\n### 20th to 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1920s Berlin, West Berlin, and East Berlin\n\nIn the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the German Expressionist movement.[55] In fields such as architecture, painting and cinema new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the First World War in 1918, a republic was proclaimed by Philipp Scheidemann at the Reichstag building. In 1920, the Greater Berlin Act incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages, and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from 66 to 883 km2 (25 to 341 sq mi). The population almost doubled, and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the Weimar era, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties but also became a renowned center of the Roaring Twenties. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government, and industries. Albert Einstein rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin,[56] being awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921.[57]\n\n\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. Hitler was inspired by the architecture he had experienced in Vienna, and he wished for a German Empire with a capital city that had a monumental ensemble. The National Socialist regime embarked on monumental construction projects in Berlin as a way to express their power and authority through architecture. Adolf Hitler and Albert Speer developed architectural concepts for the conversion of the city into World Capital Germania; these were never implemented.[58]\n\n\nNSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 due to emigration between 1933 and 1939. After Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Starting in early 1943, many were deported to ghettos like Łódź, and to concentration and extermination camps such as Auschwitz.[59]\n\n\nBerlin hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics for which the Olympic stadium was built.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Berlin in ruins after World War II (Potsdamer Platz, 1945)\nDuring World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during 1943–45 Allied air raids and the 1945 Battle of Berlin. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built-up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.[61] After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to Allied-occupied Germany the sectors of the Allies of World War II (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France) formed West Berlin, while the Soviet Union formed East Berlin.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)US and Soviet tanks face each other. Taken in 1961 at Checkpoint Charlie.\n![](image)The Berlin Wall (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.\nAll four Allies of World War II shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the Soviet Union imposed the Berlin Blockade on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The Berlin airlift, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.[63] In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in West Germany and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the Marxist–Leninist German Democratic Republic was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.\n\n\n\n![](image)The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. On 3 October 1990, the German reunification process was formally finished.\nThe founding of the two German states increased Cold War tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic center. The West German government established itself in Bonn.[64] In 1961, East Germany began to build the Berlin Wall around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. John F. Kennedy gave his \"*Ich bin ein Berliner*\" speech on 26 June 1963, in front of the Schöneberg city hall, located in the city's western part, underlining the US support for West Berlin.[65] Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a Four-Power agreement guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.[66]\n\n\nIn 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the East Side Gallery preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were reunified as the Federal Republic of Germany, and Berlin again became a reunified city.[67] Walter Momper, the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim.[68] City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first \"all Berlin\" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and Eberhard Diepgen (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.[69] On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a reunified Berlin[70] (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the Bundestag (German Parliament) voted to move the seat of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999, during the chancellorship of Gerhard Schröder.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe rebuilt Berlin Palace in 2022\n\nBerlin's 2001 administrative reform merged several boroughs, reducing their number from 23 to 12.[72]\n\n\nIn 2006, the FIFA World Cup Final was held in Berlin.[73]\n\n\nIn a 2016 terrorist attack linked to ISIL, a truck was deliberately driven into a Christmas market next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, leaving 13 people dead and 55 others injured.[74][75]\n\n\nIn 2018, more than 200,000 protestors took to the streets in Berlin with demonstrations of solidarity against racism, in response to the emergence of far-right politics in Germany.[76]\n\n\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) opened in 2020, nine years later than planned, with Terminal 1 coming into service at the end of October, and flights to and from Tegel Airport ending in November.[77] Due to the fall in passenger numbers resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, plans were announced to temporarily close BER's Terminal 5, the former Schönefeld Airport, beginning in March 2021 for up to one year.[78] The connecting link of U-Bahn line U5 from Alexanderplatz to Hauptbahnhof, along with the new stations Rotes Rathaus and Unter den Linden, opened on 4 December 2020, with the Museumsinsel U-Bahn station expected to open around March 2021, which would complete all new works on the U5.[79]\n\n\nA partial opening by the end of 2020 of the Humboldt Forum museum, housed in the reconstructed Berlin Palace, which had been announced in June, was postponed until March 2021.[80] On 16 September 2022, the opening of the eastern wing, the last section of the Humboldt Forum museum, meant the Humboldt Forum museum was finally completed. It became Germany's currently most expensive cultural project.[81]\n\n\n\n### Berlin-Brandenburg fusion attempt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fusion of Berlin and Brandenburg\n\n![](image)The coat of arms proposed in the state contract\nThe legal basis for a combined state of Berlin and Brandenburg is different from other state fusion proposals. Normally, Article 29 of the Basic Law stipulates that a state fusion requires a federal law.[82] However, a clause added to the Basic Law in 1994, Article 118a, allows Berlin and Brandenburg to unify without federal approval, requiring a referendum and a ratification by both state parliaments.[83]\n\n\nIn 1996, there was an unsuccessful attempt of unifying the states of Berlin and Brandenburg.[84] Both share a common history, dialect and culture and in 2020, there are over 225.000 residents of Brandenburg that commute to Berlin. The fusion had the near-unanimous support by a broad coalition of both state governments, political parties, media, business associations, trade unions and churches.[85] Though Berlin voted in favor by a small margin, largely based on support in former West Berlin, Brandenburg voters disapproved of the fusion by a large margin. It failed largely due to Brandenburg voters not wanting to take on Berlin's large and growing public debt and fearing losing identity and influence to the capital.[84]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Berlin\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Berlin\n![](image)The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.\nBerlin is in northeastern Germany, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat topography, part of the vast Northern European Plain which stretches all the way from northern France to western Russia. The *Berliner Urstromtal* (an ice age glacial valley), between the low Barnim Plateau to the north and the Teltow plateau to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last Weichselian glaciation. The Spree follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river Havel, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the Großer Wannsee. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the Großer Müggelsee in eastern Berlin.[86]\n\n\nSubstantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs Reinickendorf and Pankow lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, Steglitz-Zehlendorf, Tempelhof-Schöneberg, and Neukölln lie on the Teltow Plateau.\n\n\nThe borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at 122 meters (400 ft) elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed Teufelsberg (120.1 m or 394 ft), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.[87] The Müggelberge at 114.7 meters (376 ft) elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at 28.1 meters (92 ft) elevation.[88]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBerlin has an oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*)[89] bordering on a humid continental climate (*Dfb*); one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the air masses and the greater abundance during a period of the year.[90][91] This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures but sometimes hot (for being semicontinental) and cold winters but not rigorous most of the time.[92][91]\n\n\n\nDue to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter, and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of 22–25 °C (72–77 °F) and lows of 12–14 °C (54–57 °F). Winters are cool with average high temperatures of 3 °C (37 °F) and lows of −2 to 0 °C (28 to 32 °F). Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement. Temperatures can be 4 °C (7 °F) higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.[93] Annual precipitation is 570 millimeters (22 in) with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.[94] The hottest month in Berlin was July 1834, with a mean temperature of 23.0 °C (73.4 °F) and the coldest was January 1709, with a mean temperature of −13.2 °C (8.2 °F).[95] The wettest month on record was July 1907, with 230 millimeters (9.1 in) of rainfall, whereas the driest were October 1866, November 1902, October 1908 and September 1928, all with 1 millimeter (0.039 in) of rainfall.[96]\n\n| Climate data for Berlin Brandenburg 1991–2020, extremes 1957–2021\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n

history has left the city with a polycentric organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin – the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany – initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.\n\n\nBerlin was devastated by air raids, fires, and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West were demolished during the postwar period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much ornamentation on prewar buildings was destroyed following modernist dogmas, and in both postwar systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been reconstructed, including the *Forum Fridericianum* along with, the State Opera (1955), Charlottenburg Palace (1957), the monumental buildings on Gendarmenmarkt (1980s), Kommandantur (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the City Palace. Many new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as Hotel Adlon.\n\n\nClusters of towers rise at various locations: Potsdamer Platz, the City West, and Alexanderplatz, the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has five of the top 50 tallest buildings in Germany.\n\n\nOver one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands, and water.[13] Berlin's second-largest and most popular park, the Großer Tiergarten, is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from Bahnhof Zoo in the City West to the Brandenburg Gate in the east.\n\n\nAmong famous streets, Unter den Linden and Friedrichstraße are found in the city's historic heart (and were included in the former East Berlin). Some major streets in City West are Kurfürstendamm (or just Ku´damm) and Kantstraße.\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Berlin\n\nFurther information: List of sights in Berlin and List of tallest buildings in Berlin\n\n![](image)Panorama of the Gendarmenmarkt, showing the Konzerthaus Berlin, flanked by the German Church (left) and French Church (right)\n![](image)The Berlin Cathedral at Museum Island\n![](image)The TV Tower (Berliner Fernsehturm)\nThe Fernsehturm (TV tower) at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is among the tallest structures in the European Union at 368 m (1,207 ft). Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its 204-meter-high (669 ft) observation floor. Starting here, the Karl-Marx-Allee heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the Socialist Classicism style. Adjacent to this area is the Rotes Rathaus (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the Neptunbrunnen, a fountain featuring a mythological group of Tritons, personifications of the four main Prussian rivers, and Neptune on top of it.\n\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The Reichstag building is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodeled by British architect Norman Foster in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.\n\n\nThe East Side Gallery is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.\n\n\nThe Gendarmenmarkt is a neoclassical square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. Two similarly designed cathedrals border it, the Französischer Dom with its observation platform and the Deutscher Dom. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.\n\n\n\n![](image)Charlottenburg Palace\n![](image)Hackesche Höfe\nThe Museum Island in the River Spree houses five museums built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the Stadtschloss continues.[104][105] Also on the island and next to the Lustgarten and palace is Berlin Cathedral, emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. St. Hedwig's Cathedral is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.\n\n\n\n![](image)Breitscheidplatz with Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is the center of City West.\nUnter den Linden is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street, and part of Humboldt University is there. Friedrichstraße was Berlin's legendary street during the Golden Twenties. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.\n\n\nPotsdamer Platz is an entire quarter built from scratch after the Wall came down.[106] To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the Gemäldegalerie, and is flanked by the Neue Nationalgalerie and the Berliner Philharmonie. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, a Holocaust memorial, is to the north.[107]\n\n\nThe area around Hackescher Markt is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the Hackesche Höfe, a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby New Synagogue is the center of Jewish culture.\n\n\nThe Straße des 17. Juni, connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the Siegessäule (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.\n\n\nThe Kurfürstendamm is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at its eastern end on Breitscheidplatz. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is KaDeWe, claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The Rathaus Schöneberg, where John F. Kennedy made his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner!\" speech, is in Tempelhof-Schöneberg.\n\n\nWest of the center, Bellevue Palace is the residence of the German President. Charlottenburg Palace, which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.\n\n\nThe Funkturm Berlin is a 150-meter-tall (490 ft) lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant 55 m (180 ft) and an observation deck 126 m (413 ft) above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.\n\n\nThe Oberbaumbrücke over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 Berlin U-Bahn line. The bridge was completed in a brick gothic style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the Red Army from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a checkpoint and border crossing between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s, it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Berlin\n\n![](image)Berlin population pyramid in 2022\n![](image)Berlin's population, 1880–2012\nAt the end of 2018, the city-state of Berlin had 3.75 million registered inhabitants[108] in an area of 891.1 km2 (344.1 sq mi).[1] The city's population density was 4,206 inhabitants per km2. Berlin is the most populous city proper in the European Union. In 2019, the urban area of Berlin had about 4.5 million inhabitants.[3] As of 2019[update], the functional urban area was home to about 5.2 million people.[109] The entire Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has a population of more than 6 million in an area of 30,546 km2 (11,794 sq mi).[110][1]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1721 | 65,300 | —     |\n| 1750 | 113,289 | +73.5% |\n| 1800 | 172,132 | +51.9% |\n| 1815 | 197,717 | +14.9% |\n| 1825 | 220,277 | +11.4% |\n| 1840 | 330,230 | +49.9% |\n| 1852 | 438,958 | +32.9% |\n| 1861 | 547,571 | +24.7% |\n| 1871 | 826,341 | +50.9% |\n| 1880 | 1,122,330 | +35.8% |\n| 1890 | 1,578,794 | +40.7% |\n| 1900 | 1,888,848 | +19.6% |\n| 1910 | 2,071,257 | +9.7% |\n| 1920 | 3,879,409 | +87.3% |\n| 1925 | 4,082,778 | +5.2% |\n| 1933 | 4,221,024 | +3.4% |\n| 1939 | 4,330,640 | +2.6% |\n| 1945 | 3,064,629 | −29.2% |\n| 1950 | 3,336,026 | +8.9% |\n| 1960 | 3,274,016 | −1.9% |\n| 1970 | 3,208,719 | −2.0% |\n| 1980 | 3,048,759 | −5.0% |\n| 1990 | 3,433,695 | +12.6% |\n| 2000 | 3,382,169 | −1.5% |\n| 2010 | 3,460,725 | +2.3% |\n| 2020 | 3,664,088 | +5.9% |\n| 2022 | 3,755,251 | +2.5% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2014, the city-state Berlin had 37,368 live births (+6.6%), a record number since 1991. The number of deaths was 32,314. Almost 2.0 million households were counted in the city. 54 percent of them were single-person households. More than 337,000 families with children under the age of 18 lived in Berlin. In 2014, the German capital registered a migration surplus of approximately 40,000 people.[111]\n\n\n\n### Nationalities[edit]\n\n\n\n\nResidents by Citizenship (31 June 2022)[108]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany | 2,958,786\n |\n| ![](image) Turkey | 99,421\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 53,664\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 49,280\n |\n| ![](image) Syria | 44,324\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 32,362\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | 32,170\n |\n| ![](image) Russian Federation | 30,590\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 27,128\n |\n| ![](image) India | 23,771\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 22,858\n |\n| ![](image) USA | 20,990\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia | 20,567\n |\n| ![](image) France | 19,241\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 17,481\n |\n\n\nNational and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France, the city responded with the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The Greater Berlin Act in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.\n\n\nActive immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 Turkish and Turkish German residents,[108] making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey.[112] In the 1990s the *Aussiedlergesetze* enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former Soviet Union. Today ethnic Germans from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.[113] The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.[114] A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel.[115] Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.[116]\n\n\nIn December 2019 there were 777,345 registered residents of foreign nationality and another 542,975 German citizens with a \"migration background\" *(Migrationshintergrund, MH)*,[108] meaning they or one of their parents immigrated to Germany after 1955. Foreign residents of Berlin originate from about 190 countries.[117] 48 percent of the residents under the age of 15 have a migration background in 2017.[118] Berlin in 2009 was estimated to have 100,000 to 250,000 unregistered inhabitants.[119] Boroughs of Berlin with a significant number of migrants or foreign born population are Mitte, Neukölln and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.[120] The number of Arabic speakers in Berlin could be higher than 150,000. There are at least 40,000 Berliners with Syrian citizenship, third only behind Turkish and Polish citizens. The 2015 refugee crisis made Berlin Europe's capital of Arab culture.[121] Berlin is among the cities in Germany that have received the biggest amount of refugees after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of November 2022, an estimated 85,000 Ukrainian refugees were registered in Berlin,[122] making Berlin the most popular destination of Ukrainian refugees in Germany.[123]\n\n\nBerlin has a vibrant expatriate community involving precarious immigrants, illegal immigrants, seasonal workers, and refugees. Therefore Berlin sustains a broad variety of English-based speakers. Speaking a particular type of English does attract prestige and cultural capital in Berlin.[124]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German language and Berlinerisch dialect\n\nGerman is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a West Germanic language that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,[125] and one of the three working languages of the European Commission.\n\n\nBerlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically. It is spoken in Berlin and the surrounding metropolitan area. It originates from a Brandenburgish variant. The dialect is now seen more like a sociolect, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak standard German in everyday life.\n\n\nThe most commonly spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Persian, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.[126]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Berlin\n\nReligion in Berlin (2018)[127]\n\n\n\nNot religious/other (67.4%)\nEKD Protestants (13.4%)\nCatholics (7.8%)\nIslam (8.5%)\nJewish (1%)\nOther (1%)\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nClockwise from top left: Berlin Cathedral, New Synagogue, Şehitlik Mosque, and St. Hedwig's Cathedral\n\nOn the report of the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.[128]\n\n\nThe largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the Protestant regional church body—the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)—a united church. EKBO is a member of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD) and of the Union of Protestant Churches in the EKD (UEK). According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the Roman Catholic Church had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members.[129] About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly Eastern Orthodox, but also various Protestants).[130] According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church.[108] The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects church tax on behalf of the churches. It does not keep records of members of other religious organizations which may collect their own church tax, in this way.\n\n\nIn 2009, approximately 249,000 Muslims were reported by the Office of Statistics to be members of mosques and Islamic religious organizations in Berlin,[131] while in 2016, the newspaper *Der Tagesspiegel* estimated that about 350,000 Muslims observed Ramadan in Berlin.[132] In 2019, about 437,000 registered residents, 11.6% of the total, reported having a migration background from one of the Member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.[108][133] Between 1992 and 2011 the Muslim population almost doubled.[134]\n\n\nAbout 0.9% of Berliners belong to other religions. Of the estimated population of 30,000–45,000 Jewish residents,[135] approximately 12,000 are registered members of religious organizations.[130]\n\n\nBerlin is the seat of the Roman Catholic archbishop of Berlin and EKBO's elected chairperson is titled the bishop of EKBO. Furthermore, Berlin is the seat of many Orthodox cathedrals, such as the Cathedral of St. Boris the Baptist, one of the two seats of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Western and Central Europe, and the Resurrection of Christ Cathedral of the Diocese of Berlin (Patriarchate of Moscow).\n\n\nThe faithful of the different religions and denominations maintain many places of worship in Berlin. The Independent Evangelical Lutheran Church has eight parishes of different sizes in Berlin.[136] There are 36 Baptist congregations (within Union of Evangelical Free Church Congregations in Germany), 29 New Apostolic Churches, 15 United Methodist churches, eight Free Evangelical Congregations, four Churches of Christ, Scientist (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 11th), six congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an Old Catholic church, and an Anglican church in Berlin. Berlin has more than 80 mosques,[137] ten synagogues,[138] and two Buddhist temples.\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Berlin and Berlin Police\n\n### German Federal city state[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rotes Rathaus (*Red City Hall*), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin\nSince the German reunification on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three city-states of Germany among the present 16 federal states of Germany. The Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin (*House of Representatives*) functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the Senate of Berlin (*Senat von Berlin*). The Senate consists of the Governing Mayor of Berlin (*Regierender Bürgermeister*), and up to ten senators holding ministerial positions, two of them holding the title of \"Mayor\" (*Bürgermeister*) as deputy to the Governing Mayor.[139]\n\n\nThe total annual budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.[140] The German Federal city state of Berlin owns extensive assets, including administrative and government buildings, real estate companies, as well as stakes in the Olympic Stadium, swimming pools, housing companies, and numerous public enterprises and subsidiary companies.[141][142]\n\n\nThe Social Democratic Party (SPD) and The Left (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the 2001 state election and won another term in the 2006 state election.[143] From the 2016 state election until the 2023 state election, there was a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party. Since April 2023, the government has been formed by a coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats.[144]\n\n\nThe Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (*Oberbürgermeister der Stadt*) and Minister President of the State of Berlin (*Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes*). The office of the Governing Mayor is in the Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall). Since 2023, this office has been held by Kai Wegner of the Christian Democrats.[145] He is the first conservative mayor in Berlin in more than two decades.[146]\n\n\n\n### Boroughs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin\n\n![](image)Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods\nBerlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (*Bezirke*). Each borough has several subdistricts or neighborhoods (*Ortsteile*), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighborhoods, colloquially called *Kiez*. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.\n\n\nEach borough is governed by a borough council (*Bezirksamt*) consisting of five councilors (*Bezirksstadträte*) including the borough's mayor (*Bezirksbürgermeister*). The council is elected by the borough assembly (*Bezirksverordnetenversammlung*). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (*Rat der Bürgermeister*), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.\n\n\n\n### City partnerships[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany\n\nBerlin to this day maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.[147] Town twinning between West Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles, California in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification.\n\n\n\n### Capital city[edit]\n\n\nBerlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany. The President of Germany, whose functions are mainly ceremonial under the German constitution, has their official residence in Bellevue Palace.[148] Berlin is the seat of the German Chancellor (Prime Minister), housed in the Chancellery building, the *Bundeskanzleramt*. Facing the Chancellery is the Bundestag, the German Parliament, housed in the renovated Reichstag building since the government's relocation to Berlin in 1998. The Bundesrat (\"federal council\", performing the function of an upper house) is the representation of the 16 constituent states (*Länder*) of Germany and has its seat at the former Prussian House of Lords. The total annual federal budget managed by the German government exceeded €310 ($375) billion in 2013.[149]\n\n\n\n* ![The Federal Chancellery building, seat of the Chancellor of Germany](image)\n\nThe Federal Chancellery building, seat of the Chancellor of Germany\n* ![The Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag](image)\n\nThe Reichstag, seat of the Bundestag\n* ![Schloss Bellevue, seat of the President of Germany](image)\n\nSchloss Bellevue, seat of the President of Germany\n* ![Prussian House of Lords, seat of the Bundesrat of Germany](image)\n\nPrussian House of Lords, seat of the Bundesrat of Germany\n* ![Headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service](image)\n\nHeadquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service\n\n\nThe relocation of the federal government and Bundestag to Berlin was mostly completed in 1999. However, some ministries, as well as some minor departments, stayed in the federal city Bonn, the former capital of West Germany. Discussions about moving the remaining ministries and departments to Berlin continue.[150] The Federal Foreign Office and the ministries and departments of Defense, Justice and Consumer Protection, Finance, Interior, Economic Affairs and Energy, Labor and Social Affairs, Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Food and Agriculture, Economic Cooperation and Development, Health, Transport and Digital Infrastructure and Education and Research are based in the capital.\n\n\nBerlin hosts in total 158 foreign embassies[151] as well as the headquarters of many think tanks, trade unions, nonprofit organizations, lobbying groups, and professional associations. Due to the influence and international partnerships of the Federal Republic of Germany, the capital city has become a significant center of German and European affairs. Frequent official visits and diplomatic consultations among governmental representatives and national leaders are common in contemporary Berlin.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Berlin\n\n![](image)Berlin is a UNESCO \"City of Design\" and recognized for its creative industries and startup ecosystem.[152]\nIn 2018, the GDP of Berlin totaled €147 billion, an increase of 3.1% over the previous year.[1] Berlin's economy is dominated by the service sector, with around 84% of all companies doing business in services.

It is also the 4th ranked region in former East Germany after Jena, Dresden and Potsdam.[181][182]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Transport in Berlin[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Berlin\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nBerlin's transport infrastructure is highly complex, providing a diverse range of urban mobility.[183]\n\n\nA total of 979 bridges cross 197 km (122 miles) the inner-city waterways. Berlin roads total 5,422 km (3,369 miles) of which 77 km (48 miles) are motorways (known as Autobahn).[184] In 2013 only 1.344 million motor vehicles were registered in the city.[184] With 377 cars per 1000 residents in 2013 (570/1000 in Germany), Berlin as a Western global city has one of the lowest numbers of cars per capita.[185]\n\n\n\n### Taxicabs[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, around 7,600 mostly beige colored taxicabs were in service. Since 2011 a number of app based e-car and e-scooter sharing services have evolved.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)DB Station Potsdamer Platz\n![](image)Berlin Hauptbahnhof has railway tracks on two levels\nLong-distance rail lines directly connect Berlin with all of the major cities of Germany. the regional rail lines of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg provide access to Brandenburg and to the Baltic Sea. The Berlin Hauptbahnhof is the largest grade-separated railway station in Europe.[186] The Deutsche Bahn runs the high speed Intercity-Express (ICE) to domestic destinations, including Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt am Main.\n\n\n\n### Water transport[edit]\n\n\nThe Spree and the Havel rivers cross Berlin. There are no frequent passenger connections to and from Berlin by water. Berlin's largest harbour, the Westhafen, is located in the district of Moabit. It is a transhipment and storage site for inland shipping with a growing importance.[187]\n\n\n\n### Intercity buses[edit]\n\n\nThere is an increasing quantity of intercity bus services. Berlin city has more than 10 stations[188] that run buses to destinations throughout Berlin. Destinations in Germany and Europe are connected via the intercity bus exchange *Zentraler Omnibusbahnhof Berlin*.\n\n\n\n### Urban public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Berlin U-Bahn (Metro) at Heidelberger Platz station\n![](image)Alexanderplatz U-bahn Station\nThe *Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe* (BVG) and the German State-owned Deutsche Bahn (DB) manage several extensive urban public transport systems.[189]\n\n\n\n\n\n| System\n | Stations / Lines / Net length\n | Annual ridership\n | Operator / Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| S-Bahn | 166 / 16 / 331 km (206 mi)\n | 431,000,000 (2016) | DB / Mainly overground rapid transit rail system with suburban stops\n |\n| U-Bahn | 173 / 9 / 146 km (91 mi)\n | 563,000,000 (2017) | BVG / Mainly underground rail system / 24h-service on weekends\n |\n| Tram | 404 / 22 / 194 km (121 mi)\n | 197,000,000 (2017) | BVG / Operates predominantly in eastern boroughs\n |\n| Bus | 3227 / 198 / 1,675 km (1,041 mi)\n | 440,000,000 (2017) | BVG / Extensive services in all boroughs / 62 Night Lines\n |\n| Ferry | 6 lines\n |  | BVG / Transportation as well as recreational ferries\n |\n\n\nPublic transport in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20th-century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since 1989, the transport network has been developed extensively. However, it still contains early 20th century traits, such as the U1.[190]\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Berlin Brandenburg Airport\n![](image)Airports in Berlin, including those that are no longer used (as of November 2020)\n![](image)Typical cycle street in Prenzlauer Berg\nBerlin is served by one commercial international airport: Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing Tegel Airport (TXL) and Schönefeld Airport (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.[191] Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.[192] The planned initial capacity of around 27 million passengers per year[193] is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55 million per year by 2040.[194]\n\n\nBefore the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as the BER. Both airports together handled 29.5 million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.[195] Tegel Airport was a focus city for Lufthansa and Eurowings while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like Germania, easyJet and Ryanair. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller Tempelhof Airport, which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city center, allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport. The airport grounds have since been turned into a city park.\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cycling in Berlin\n\nBerlin is well known for its highly developed bicycle lane system.[196] It is estimated Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Around 500,000 daily bike riders accounted for 13 percent of total traffic in 2010.[197] Cyclists have access to 620 km (385 mi) of bicycle paths including approximately 150 km (93 mi) of mandatory bicycle paths, 190 km (118 mi) of off-road bicycle routes, 60 km (37 mi) of bicycle lanes on roads, 70 km (43 mi) of shared bus lanes which are also open to cyclists, 100 km (62 mi) of combined pedestrian/bike paths and 50 km (31 mi) of marked bicycle lanes on roadside pavements (or sidewalks).[198] Riders are allowed to carry their bicycles on Regionalbahn, S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains, on trams, and on night buses if a bike ticket is purchased.[199]\n\n\n\n## Rohrpost[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rohrpost in Berlin\n\nFrom 1865 to 1976, Berlin operated an expansive pneumatic postal network, reaching a maximum length of 400 kilometers (roughly 250 miles) by 1940. The system was divided into two distinct networks after 1949. The West Berlin system remained in public use until 1963, and continued to be utilized for government correspondence until 1972. Conversely, the East Berlin system, which incorporated the *Hauptelegraphenamt*—the central hub of the operation—remained functional until 1976.\n\n\n\n## Energy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant\nBerlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm Vattenfall and the Berlin-based company GASAG. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern Brandenburg.[200]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update] the five largest power plants measured by capacity are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these power stations generate electricity and useful heat at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.\n\n\nIn 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380 kV and a 110 kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban Autobahn, use overhead lines. The Berlin 380-kV electric line is the backbone of the city's energy grid.\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Charité university hospital\nBerlin has a long history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.[201] The modern history of medicine has been significantly influenced by scientists from Berlin. Rudolf Virchow was the founder of cellular pathology, while Robert Koch developed vaccines for anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis.[202]\n\n\nThe Charité complex (Universitätsklinik Charité) is the largest university hospital in Europe, tracing back its origins to the year 1710. More than half of all German Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, including Emil von Behring, Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich, have worked at the Charité. The Charité is spread over four campuses and comprises around 3,000 beds, 15,500 staff, 8,000 students, and more than 60 operating theaters, and it has a turnover of two billion euros annually.[203] The Charité is a joint institution of the Freie Universität Berlin and the Humboldt University of Berlin, including a wide range of institutes and specialized medical centers.\n\n\n\n## Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Radio and telecommunication in Berlin\n\n![](image)Café customers in Berlin Mitte using Wi-Fi devices\nSince 2017, the digital television standard in Berlin and Germany is DVB-T2. This system transmits compressed digital audio, digital video and other data in an MPEG transport stream.\n\n\nBerlin has installed several hundred free public Wireless LAN sites across the capital since 2016. The wireless networks are concentrated mostly in central districts; 650 hotspots (325 indoor and 325 outdoor access points) are installed.[204]\n\n\nThe UMTS (3G) and LTE (4G) networks of the three major cellular operators Vodafone, T-Mobile and O2 enable the use of mobile broadband applications citywide.\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Berlin\n\n![](image)The Humboldt University of Berlin is affiliated with 57 Nobel Prize winners.\nAs of 2014[update], Berlin had 878 schools, teaching 340,658 students in 13,727 classes and 56,787 trainees in businesses and elsewhere.[156] The city has a 6-year primary education program.

The Brücke Museum features one of the largest collection of works by artist of the early 20th-century expressionist movement. In Lichtenberg, on the grounds of the former East German Ministry for State Security, is the Stasi Museum. The site of Checkpoint Charlie, one of the most renowned crossing points of the Berlin Wall, is still preserved. A private museum venture exhibits a comprehensive documentation of detailed plans and strategies devised by people who tried to flee from the East.\n\n\nThe Beate Uhse Erotic Museum claimed to be the largest erotic museum in the world until it closed in 2014.[233][234]\n\n\nThe cityscape of Berlin displays large quantities of urban street art.[235] It has become a significant part of the city's cultural heritage and has its roots in the graffiti scene of Kreuzberg of the 1980s.[236] The Berlin Wall itself has become one of the largest open-air canvasses in the world.[237] The leftover stretch along the Spree river in Friedrichshain remains as the East Side Gallery. Berlin today is consistently rated as an important world city for street art culture.[238]\nBerlin has galleries which are quite rich in contemporary art. Located in Mitte, KW Institute for Contemporary Art, KOW, Sprüth Magers; Kreuzberg there are a few galleries as well such as Blain Southern, Esther Schipper, Future Gallery, König Gallerie.\n\n\n\n### Nightlife and festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Berlinale is the largest international spectator film festival.\nBerlin's nightlife has been celebrated as one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind.[239][240] In the 1970s and 80s, the SO36 in Kreuzberg was a center for punk music and culture. The *SOUND* and the *Dschungel* gained notoriety. Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in Western and Central Europe, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city center of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and counterculture gatherings.[241] The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, Tresor and Berghain. The KitKatClub and several other locations are known for their sexually uninhibited parties.\n\n\nClubs are not required to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning or even all weekend. The *Weekend Club* near Alexanderplatz features a roof terrace that allows partying at night. Several venues have become a popular stage for the Neo-Burlesque scene.\n\n\n\n![](image)The French Cathedral during the annual Festival of Lights\n![](image)Hanukkah festival at the Brandenburg Gate\nBerlin has a long history of gay culture, and is an important birthplace of the LGBT rights movement. Same-sex bars and dance halls operated freely as early as the 1880s, and the first gay magazine, *Der Eigene*, started in 1896. By the 1920s, gays and lesbians had an unprecedented visibility.[242][243] Today, in addition to a positive atmosphere in the wider club scene, the city again has a huge number of queer clubs and festivals. The most famous and largest are Berlin Pride, the Christopher Street Day,[244] the Lesbian and Gay City Festival in Berlin-Schöneberg, the Kreuzberg Pride and Hustlaball.\n\n\nThe annual Berlin International Film Festival (Berlinale) with around 500,000 admissions is considered to be the largest publicly attended film festival in the world.[245][246] The Karneval der Kulturen (*Carnival of Cultures*), a multi-ethnic street parade, is celebrated every Pentecost weekend.[247] Berlin is also well known for the cultural festival Berliner Festspiele, which includes the jazz festival JazzFest Berlin, and Young Euro Classic, the largest international festival of youth orchestras in the world. Several technology and media art festivals and conferences are held in the city, including Transmediale and Chaos Communication Congress. The annual Berlin Festival focuses on indie rock, electronic music and synthpop and is part of the International Berlin Music Week.[248][249] Every year Berlin hosts one of the largest New Year's Eve celebrations in the world, attended by well over a million people. The focal point is the Brandenburg Gate, where midnight fireworks are centered, but various private fireworks displays take place throughout the entire city. Partygoers in Germany often toast the New Year with a glass of sparkling wine.\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music in Berlin\n\n![](image)Sir Simon Rattle conducting the renowned Berlin Philharmonic\nBerlin is home to 44 theaters and stages.[156] The Deutsches Theater in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has operated almost continuously since then. The Volksbühne at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded in 1890. The Berliner Ensemble, famous for performing the works of Bertolt Brecht, was established in 1949. The Schaubühne was founded in 1962 and moved to the building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm in 1981. With a seating capacity of 1,895 and a stage floor of 2,854 square meters (30,720 sq ft), the Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin Mitte is the largest show palace in Europe. For Berlin's independent dance and theatre scene, venues such as the Sophiensäle in Mitte and the three houses of the Hebbel am Ufer (HAU) in Kreuzberg are important. Most productions there are also accessible to an English-speaking audience. Some of the dance and theatre groups that also work internationally (Gob Squad, Rimini Protokoll) are based there, as well as festivals such as the international festival Dance in August.\n\n\nBerlin has three major opera houses: the Deutsche Oper, the Berlin State Opera, and the Komische Oper. The Berlin State Opera on Unter den Linden opened in 1742 and is the oldest of the three. Its musical director is Daniel Barenboim. The Komische Oper has traditionally specialized in operettas and is also at Unter den Linden. The Deutsche Oper opened in 1912 in Charlottenburg.\n\n\nThe city's main venue for musical theater performances are the Theater am Potsdamer Platz and Theater des Westens (built in 1895). Contemporary dance can be seen at the *Radialsystem V*. The Tempodrom is host to concerts and circus-inspired entertainment. It also houses a multi-sensory spa experience. The Admiralspalast in Mitte has a vibrant program of variety and music events.\n\n\nThere are seven symphony orchestras in Berlin. The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra is one of the preeminent orchestras in the world;[250] it is housed in the Berliner Philharmonie near Potsdamer Platz on a street named for the orchestra's longest-serving conductor, Herbert von Karajan.[251] Simon Rattle was its principal conductor from 1999 to 2018, a position now held by Kirill Petrenko. The Konzerthausorchester Berlin was founded in 1952 as the orchestra for East Berlin. Christoph Eschenbach is its principal conductor. The Haus der Kulturen der Welt presents exhibitions dealing with intercultural issues and stages world music and conferences.[252] The *Kookaburra* and the *Quatsch Comedy Club* are known for satire and comedy shows. In 2018, the *New York Times* described Berlin as \"arguably the world capital of underground electronic music\".[253]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Berlin\n\n![](image)\nThe Currywurst Museum\n![](image)\nA plate of Currywurst\nInvented in Berlin, currywurst is an icon of German popular culture and cuisine.\n\nThe cuisine and culinary offerings of Berlin vary greatly. 23 restaurants in Berlin have been awarded one or more Michelin stars in the Michelin Guide of 2021, which ranks the city at the top for the number of restaurants having this distinction in Germany.[254] Berlin is well known for its offerings of vegetarian[255] and vegan[256] cuisine and is home to an innovative entrepreneurial food scene promoting cosmopolitan flavors, local and sustainable ingredients, pop-up street food markets, supper clubs, as well as food festivals, such as Berlin Food Week.[257][258]\n\n\nMany local foods originated from north German culinary traditions and include rustic and hearty dishes with pork, goose, fish, peas, beans, cucumbers, or potatoes. Typical Berliner fare include popular street food like the *Currywurst* (which gained popularity with postwar construction workers rebuilding the city), *Buletten* and the *Berliner* donut, known in Berlin as *Pfannkuchen*.[259][260] German bakeries offering a variety of breads and pastries are widespread. One of Europe's largest delicatessen markets is found at the KaDeWe, and among the world's largest chocolate stores is *Rausch*.[261][262]\n\n\nBerlin is also home to a diverse gastronomy scene reflecting the immigrant history of the city. Turkish and Arab immigrants brought their culinary traditions to the city, such as the lahmajoun and falafel, which have become common fast food staples. The modern fast-food version of the doner kebab sandwich which evolved in Berlin in the 1970s, has since become a favorite dish in Germany and elsewhere in the world.[263] Asian cuisine like Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Korean, and Japanese restaurants, as well as Spanish tapas bars, Italian, and Greek cuisine, can be found in many parts of the city.\n\n\n\n### Recreation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Elephant Gate at the Berlin Zoo\nZoologischer Garten Berlin, the older of two zoos in the city, was founded in 1844. It is the most visited zoo in Europe and presents the most diverse range of species in the world.[264] It was the home of the captive-born celebrity polar bear Knut.[265] The city's other zoo, Tierpark Friedrichsfelde, was founded in 1955.\n\n\nBerlin's Botanischer Garten includes the Botanic Museum Berlin. With an area of 43 hectares (110 acres) and around 22,000 different plant species, it is one of the largest and most diverse collections of botanical life in the world. Other gardens in the city include the Britzer Garten, and the Gärten der Welt (Gardens of the World) in Marzahn.[266]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Victory Column in Tiergarten\nThe Tiergarten park in Mitte, with landscape design by Peter Joseph Lenné, is one of Berlin's largest and most popular parks.[267] In Kreuzberg, the Viktoriapark provides a viewing point over the southern part of inner-city Berlin. Treptower Park, beside the Spree in Treptow, features a large Soviet War Memorial. The Volkspark in Friedrichshain, which opened in 1848, is the oldest park in the city, with monuments, a summer outdoor cinema and several sports areas.[268] Tempelhofer Feld, the site of the former city airport, is the world's largest inner-city open space.[269]\n\n\nPotsdam is on the southwestern periphery of Berlin. The city was a residence of the Prussian kings and the German Kaiser, until 1918. The area around Potsdam in particular Sanssouci is known for a series of interconnected lakes and cultural landmarks. The Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin are the largest World Heritage Site in Germany.[270]\n\n\nBerlin is also well known for its numerous cafés, street musicians, beach bars along the Spree River, flea markets, boutique shops and pop-up stores, which are a source for recreation and leisure.[271]\n\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Berlin\n\n![](image)The Olympiastadion hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics and the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final.\n![](image)The Berlin Marathon is the world record course.\nBerlin has established a high-profile as a host city of major international sporting events.[272] The city hosted the 1936 Summer Olympics and was the host city for the 2006 FIFA World Cup final.[273] The World Athletics Championships was held in the Olympiastadion in 2009 and 2025.[274] The city hosted the Basketball Euroleague Final Four in 2009 and 2016.[275] and was one of the hosts of the FIBA EuroBasket 2015. In 2015 Berlin became the venue for the UEFA Champions League Final.\n\n\nBerlin will host the 2023 Special Olympics World Summer Games. This will be the first time Germany has ever hosted the Special Olympics World Games.[276]\n\n\nThe annual Berlin Marathon – a course that holds the most top-10 world record runs – and the ISTAF are well-established athletic events in the city.[277] The Mellowpark in Köpenick is one of the biggest skate and BMX parks in Europe.[278] A Fan Fest at Brandenburg Gate, which attracts several hundred-thousand spectators, has become popular during international football competitions, like the UEFA European Championship.[279]\n\n\nIn 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.[280] The city of Berlin operates more than 60 public indoor and outdoor swimming pools.[281] Berlin is the largest Olympic training center in Germany. About 500 top athletes (15% of all German top athletes) are based there. Forty-seven elite athletes participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Berliners would achieve seven gold, twelve silver and three bronze medals.[282]\n\n\nSeveral professional clubs representing the most important spectator team sports in Germany have their base in Berlin. The oldest and most popular first division team based in Berlin is the football club Hertha BSC.[283] The team represented Berlin as a founding member of the Bundesliga in 1963. Other professional team sport clubs include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | Sport\n | Founded\n | League\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hertha BSC[283] | Football | 1892\n | Bundesliga | Olympiastadion |\n| 1.

Since the 19th century,[11] the name \"London\" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3][14]\n\n\nAs one of the world's major global cities,[15] London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications.[16][17] Its GDP of €801.66 billion in 2017 makes it the largest urban economy in Europe,[18] and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,[19] it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[20][21] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world.[22] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.[23]\n\n\nLondon's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.[24] The 2023 population of Greater London of just under 10 million[25] made it Europe's third-most populous city,[26] accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom[27] and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016,[note 4][30][31] granting London the status of a megacity.\n\n\nLondon has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[32] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. London has many museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres.[33] Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.[34]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Etymology of London\n\n*London* is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form *Londinium*.[35] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually *Londinium*), Old English (usually *Lunden*), and Welsh (usually *Llundein*), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as \\**Londonjon* or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as *Londinium* and borrowed into Old English.[36]\n\n\nUntil 1889, the name \"London\" applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.[37]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of London\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of London.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[38] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC.[38] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC,[39] were found on the Thames's south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[40] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.[40]\n\n\n\n### Roman London[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Londinium\n\n![](image)Reconstruction drawing of Londinium in 120 AD\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[41] This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground.[42]\n\n\nThe next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of about 60,000.[43]\n\n\n\n### Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450.[44] From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city.[45] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[46]\n\n\nThe Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* records that Alfred \"refounded\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.[47]\n\n\nBy the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \"It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (by Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings.\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[51]\n\n\nIn the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[52] With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third of its population.[53] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[54]\n\n\nLondon was a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[55] In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[56]\n\n\n\n### Early modern[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.\nDuring the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[57] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (*kontor*) of England in London, called the *Stalhof* or *Steelyard*. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[58] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.[59]\n\n\nYet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity.[60] The Royal Exchange was founded.[61] Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World. London became the main North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[57]\n\n\nIn the 16th century, William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London during English Renaissance theatre. Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 in Southwark. Stage performances came to a halt in London when Puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s and 1650s.[62] The ban on theatre was lifted during the Restoration in 1660, and London's oldest operating theatre, Drury Lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the West End theatre district.[63]\n\n\nBy the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605.[64] In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the London area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation's \"The Great Refusal\", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.[65]\n\n\nIn the English Civil War, the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[66]\nThe fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[67] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.\nLondon was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[69] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[69]\n\n\nThe Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[70] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke.[71] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.[72]\n\n\nIn 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime,[73] and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[74] Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.[75]\n\n\nCoffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[76]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew.[77][78] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare).[79] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers.[77] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[80] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.[81]\n\n\nFrom the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain, with Lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in 1894, leading the way.[82] The tearooms, such as the Criterion in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement.[83] The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral bombed.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBritish volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, during World War I\n![](image)\nA bombed-out London street during the Blitz, World War II\n\nLondon was bombed by the Germans in the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German *Luftwaffe* killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[85] The tomb of the Unknown Warrior, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920.[86] The Cenotaph, located in Whitehall, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the National Service of Remembrance held annually on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November.[87]\n\n\nThe 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, while London was still recovering from the war.[88] From the 1940s, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,[89] making London one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank.[90] The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the \"pea soup fogs\" for which London had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the \"Big Smoke\".[91]\n\n\nStarting mainly in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London sub-culture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street.[92] The role of trendsetter revived in the punk era.[93] In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created.[94] During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[95] These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing.[95] Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.[96]\n\n\nGreater London's population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[97] The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was born out of London's increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s.[98] Located about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central London, the Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.[99]\n\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, leaving London with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the Greater London Authority.[100] To mark the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.[101] On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, as the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[34] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[95]\n\n\nIn 2008, *Time* named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing them as the world's three most influential global cities.[102] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939.[103] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but most London constituencies voted for remaining.[104] However, Britain's exit from the EU in early 2021 only marginally weakened London's position as an international financial centre.[105]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III and his wife, Camilla, as king and queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, took place at Westminster Abbey, London.[106]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government\n\n![](image)Arms of the Corporation of the City of London[107]\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[108] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues.[109] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[110] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[111]\n\n\nThe local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[112] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation, social services, local roads and refuse collection.[113] Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[114]\n\n\nThe London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London, run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. It is the third largest fire service in the world.[115] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[116] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[117]\n\n\n\n### National government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)10 Downing Street, official residence of the Prime Minister\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[118] There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of December 2019[update], 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrats.[119] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994 and as of 2020 is held by Paul Scully.[120]\n\n\n\n### Policing and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in London\n\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[121] The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall. The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[122] First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\".[123] Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in *Doctor Who*) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK.[124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, at the SIS Building. Scenes featuring James Bond (the fictional MI6 agent) have been filmed here.\nThe British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[125]\nThe Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.[126] The UK's domestic counter-intelligence service (MI5) is headquartered in Thames House on the north bank of the River Thames, and the foreign intelligence service (MI6) is headquartered in the SIS Building on the south bank.[127]\n\n\nCrime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.[128] In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[129]\nRecorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved.[130] However, the murder rate in London is much lower than other major cities around the world.[131]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of London\n\n### Scope[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of London in June 2018\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways.[132]\n\n\nForty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, in which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[133] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[134]\n\n\nFurther urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[135] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London,[136] and by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W﻿ / ﻿51.50722°N 0.12750°W﻿ / 51.50722; -0.12750.[137]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[138] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[139] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed by statute or in written form.[note 5]\n\n\nIts status as a capital was established by constitutional convention, which means its status as *de facto* capital is a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[142] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as *London*.[143]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)London from Primrose Hill\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2).[144]\n\n\nModern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[145]\n\n\nSince the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[146] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles as a result of post-glacial rebound.[147]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of London\n\n\n\n| London, England\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 59\n\n\n\n8\n\n3\n | 45\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n | 39\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 42\n\n\n\n15\n\n6\n | 46\n\n\n\n18\n\n9\n | 47\n\n\n\n22\n\n12\n | 46\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 53\n\n\n\n23\n\n14\n | 50\n\n\n\n20\n\n12\n | 65\n\n\n\n16\n\n9\n | 67\n\n\n\n11\n\n5\n | 57\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 2.3\n\n\n\n47\n\n37\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n48\n\n37\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n53\n\n39\n | 1.7\n\n\n\n59\n\n43\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n48\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n71\n\n54\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n75\n\n58\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n57\n | 2\n\n\n\n68\n\n53\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n60\n\n48\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n53\n\n41\n | 2.2\n\n\n\n48\n\n38\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.[148] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).[149] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City.[150] Despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually. However, London is vulnerable to climate change in the United Kingdom, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.[151]\n\n\nTemperature extremes in London range from 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to −17.4 °C (0.7 °F) at Northolt on 13 December 1981.[152][153] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.[154]\n\n\nSummers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[155] A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths.[156] A previous temperature of 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard.[157] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[158] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[159]\n\n\nWinters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[160] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.[161]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for London (LHR),[note 6] elevation: 25 m (82 ft), 1991–2020 normals\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 4.1(39.4)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −16.1(3.0)\n | −13.9(7.0)\n | −8.9(16.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −7.1(19.2)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 58.8(2.31)\n | 45.0(1.77)\n | 38.8(1.53)\n | 42.3(1.67)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 47.3(1.86)\n | 45.8(1.80)\n | 52.8(2.08)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 65.1(2.56)\n | 66.6(2.62)\n | 57.1(2.25)\n | 615.0(24.21)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 11.5\n | 9.5\n | 8.5\n | 8.8\n | 8.0\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.4\n | 7.9\n | 10.8\n | 11.2\n | 10.8\n | 111.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 80\n | 77\n | 70\n | 65\n | 67\n | 65\n | 65\n | 69\n | 73\n | 78\n | 81\n | 81\n | 73\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3(37)\n | 2(36)\n | 2(36)\n | 4(39)\n | 7(45)\n | 10(50)\n | 12(54)\n | 12(54)\n | 10(50)\n | 9(48)\n | 6(43)\n | 3(37)\n | 7(44)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 61.1\n | 78.8\n | 124.5\n | 176.7\n | 207.5\n | 208.4\n | 217.8\n | 202.1\n | 157.1\n | 115.2\n | 70.7\n | 55.0\n | 1,674.8\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 23\n | 28\n | 31\n | 40\n | 41\n | 41\n | 42\n | 45\n | 40\n | 35\n | 27\n | 21\n | 35\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Met Office[162][163][164] Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute[165][166] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[167] CEDA Archive[168] TORRO[169] Time and Date[170]\nSee Climate of London for additional climate information.\n |\n\n1. **^** London is not a city in the usual UK sense of having city status granted by the Crown.\n2. **^** See also: Independent city § National capitals\n3. **^** The Greater London Authority consists of the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)The West End theatre district in 2016\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[172] The City of London is the main financial district,[173] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.\n\n\nThe West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[174] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[175] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[176][177]\n\n\nThe East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[178] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[178]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of London, List of tallest buildings and structures in London, and List of demolished buildings and structures in London\n\n![](image)The Tower of London, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace.[179]\n\n\nPart of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Christopher Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey courthouse and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[180] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.\n\n\n\n![](image)The east wing public façade of Buckingham Palace was built between 1847 and 1850; it was remodelled to its present form in 1913.\n![](image)Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right\nThe Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column (built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson) is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow London stock brick.[181]\n\n\nIn the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed \"The Gherkin\"), Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings.[182] This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of London since 1937.[182] Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London, including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom and Western Europe.[183]\n\n\nOther notable modern buildings include The Scalpel, 20 Fenchurch Street (dubbed \"The Walkie-Talkie\"), the former City Hall in Southwark, the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. The BT Tower stands at 620 feet (189 m) and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) on the right foreground, the London Eye on the left foreground and The Shard with Canary Wharf in the background; seen in September 2014\n\n### Natural history[edit]\n\n\nThe London Natural History Society suggests that London is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[185] They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.[186]\n\n\nAmphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)A fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London\nAmong other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square kilometre) of London. Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel.[188] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[189] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.[190]\n\n\nHerds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[191] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[192]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demography of London\n\n\n\n2021 Census - Population of London by country of birth[193]\n| Country of Birth | Population | Percent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,223,986 | 59.4\n |\n| Non-United Kingdom | 3,575,739 | 40.6\n |\n|  | ![](image) India | 322,644 | 3.7\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 175,991 | 2.0\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 149,397 | 1.7\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 138,895 | 1.6\n |\n| ![](image) Pakistan | 129,774 | 1.5\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 126,059 | 1.4\n |\n| ![](image) Nigeria | 117,145 | 1.3\n |\n| ![](image) Ireland | 96,566 | 1.1\n |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 80,379 | 0.9\n |\n| ![](image) France | 77,715 | 0.9\n |\n| Others | 2,161,174 | 24.6\n |\n| Total | 8,799,725 | 100.0\n |\n\n\n![](image)Population density map\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were foreign-born,[194] making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.[195]\n\n\nThe population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter.[196] London's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011,[29] while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used.[197] According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001.[198]\n\n\nThe region covers 610 square miles (1,579 km2), giving a population density of 13,410 inhabitants per square mile (5,177/km2)[144] more than ten times that of any other British region.[199] In population terms, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.[200]\n\n\n\n### Age structure and median age[edit]\n\n\nChildren younger than 14 constituted 20.6% of the population in Outer London in 2018, and 18% in Inner London. The 15–24 age group was 11.1% in Outer and 10.2% in Inner London, those aged 25–44 years 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London, those aged 45–64 years 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively. Those aged 65 and over are 13.6% in Outer London, but only 9.3% in Inner London.[201]\n\n\nThe median age of London's residents in 2018 was 36.5, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3.[201]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in London\n\nMaps of Greater London showing percentage distribution of selected ethnic groups according to the 2021 Census\n![White](image)\nWhite (53.8%)\n![Asian](image)\nAsian (20.8%)\n![Black](image)\nBlack (13.5%)\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9% White British, 2.2% White Irish, 0.1% gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1% classified as Other White.[202] Meanwhile, 20.9% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 19.7% being of full Asian descents and 1.2% being of mixed-Asian heritage. Indians accounted for 6.6% of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7% each. Chinese people accounted for 1.5%, and Arabs for 1.3%. A further 4.9% were classified as \"Other Asian\".[202]\n\n\n15.6% of London's population were of Black or mixed-Black descent. 13.3% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3%. Black Africans accounted for 7.0% of London's population; 4.2% identified as Black Caribbean, and 2.1% as \"Other Black\". 5.0% were of mixed race.[202] The history of African presence extends back to the Roman period.[203]\n\n\nAs of 2007, one fifth of primary school students across London were from ethnic minorities.[204] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4% were White, 19.8% Asian, 19% Black, 10.8% Mixed and 4% another ethnic group.[205] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000.[206] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2021[update], London's foreign-born population was 3,346,000 (35%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.[207]\n\n\nThe 2011 census showed that 36.7% of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[208] Estimates by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London from July 2009 to June 2010 were born in India, Poland, Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[209] In the 2021 census 40.6% of London residents were foreign-born.[194] The ethnic demographics of the 2021 census were reported as 53.8% White, with White British reported at 36.8%, Asian or Asian British at 20.8%, Black or Black British at 13.5%, mixed 5.7% and other at 6.3%.[210]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in London\n\nSee also: List of churches in London\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings were Christians (48.4%), followed by those of no religion (20.7%), Muslims (12.4%), no response (8.5%), Hindus (5.0%), Jews (1.8%), Sikhs (1.5%), Buddhists (1.0%) and other (0.6%).[211]\n\n\nLondon has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[212] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSt Paul's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of London\n![](image)\nThe BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London is the second-largest Hindu temple in England and Europe.\n\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[214] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[215] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[216]\n\n\nNotable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[217] and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge in West London.[218][219][220] There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[221]\n\n\nLarge Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter hosting what was until 2006[222] Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[223] London is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[224]\n\n\nThe majority of British Jews live in London, with notable Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware, all in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe.[225] The London Jewish Forum was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[226]\n\n\n\n### Accents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church was considered to be a true Cockney.[227]\nCockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.[228] Some features of Cockney include, *Th*-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\", *H*-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel.[229] John Camden Hotten, in his *Slang Dictionary* of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.[230]\n\n\nEstuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation.[231] It is widely spoken by people of all classes.[232]\n\n\nMulticultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.[233]\n\n\nReceived Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[234] It has no specific geographical correlate,[235] although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.[236] It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners.[237]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of London\n\n![](image)The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[238]\nLondon's gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[239] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[240] London is the world's most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report.[241] As of 2015[update] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion.[242] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[243] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities.[244]\n\n\n\n### City of London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square and Temple Bar\n![](image)The Royal Exchange in 1886\nLondon's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[245] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century.[72] The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[76] This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.[246][247]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bank of England, established in 1694, is the model on which most modern central banks are based.\nBy the mid-19th century, London was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world's trade was financed in British currency.[248] Still, as of 2016[update] London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[249] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[250]\n\n\nLondon's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[251] Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[252] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market.[253]\n\n\nOver half the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[254] In a 1992 report commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of his family's confectionery company Cadbury, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world.[255]\n\n\n\n### Media and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in London\n\n![](image)Broadcasting House in central London, headquarters of the BBC\nMedia companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[256] The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers, including *The Times*, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press. London is one of the world's largest retail destinations, with the city frequently ranking at or near the top of retail sales of any city.[257][258] In 2017 it was ranked the top city for luxury store openings.[259] The Port of London is the second largest in the UK, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[260]\n\n\nA growing number of technology companies are based in London, notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In 2014 the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[261] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future in the 2014/15 list by *fDi Intelligence*.[262] A museum in Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing was based during World War II, is in Bletchley, 40 miles (64 km) north of central London, as is The National Museum of Computing.[263]\n\n\nThe gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[264] and UK Power Networks.[265]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in London\n\n![](image)\nThe British Museum\n![](image)\nThe National Gallery\n\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[266] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[267] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy.[268] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[269] As of 2016[update] London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[270]\n\n\nIn 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue)[271]\n\n\n\n1. British Museum: 6,820,686\n2. National Gallery: 5,908,254\n3. Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023\n4. Southbank Centre: 5,102,883\n5. Tate Modern: 4,712,581\n6. Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325\n7. Science Museum: 3,356,212\n8. Somerset House: 3,235,104\n9. Tower of London: 2,785,249\n10. National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486\n\n\nThe number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[272]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London\n\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[273] but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).[109]\n\n\nThe lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or *London Transport* was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[274]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Airports of London\n\n![](image)Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic (Terminal 5C is pictured).\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word *London* in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\n\n\n* Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[275] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[276]\n* Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of easyJet, the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[277]\n* Stansted Airport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of Ryanair, the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[278]\n* Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines (especially easyJet and Wizz Air) for short-haul flights.[279]\n* London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[280]\n* Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.[281] In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.[282]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n#### Underground and DLR[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Underground is the world's oldest and third-longest rapid transit system.\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world.[283][284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890.[285]\n\n\nOver four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[286] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[287] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Suburban[edit]\n\n\nThere are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[289] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[290] Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges.[291]\n\n\nWith the need for more rail capacity, the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022.[292] It is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[293] It was Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[294]\n\n\n\n#### Inter-city and international[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St Pancras International is the main terminal for high-speed Eurostar and High Speed 1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Railway services.\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[295] King's Cross station and Euston station, both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line – the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns.[296] *The Flying Scotsman* is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, *Flying Scotsman*, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.[297]\n\n\nSome international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[298] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[299] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.[300]\n\n\n\n### Buses, coaches and trams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A New Routemaster (which replaced the AEC Routemaster) entered service in 2012. The red double-decker bus is an emblematic symbol of London.\nLondon's bus network runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops.[301] In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year.[302] Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.[303] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world[304] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.[305]\n\n\nLondon's coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, opened in 1932. Nationalised in 1970 and subsequently purchased by London Transport which then became Transport for London, Victoria Coach Station has over 14 million passengers a year and provides services across the UK and continental Europe.[306]\n\n\nLondon has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink. It has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[307] Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.[308]\n\n\n\n### Cable car[edit]\n\n\nLondon's first and to date only cable car is the London Cable Car, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the Thames and links Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times.[309]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cycling in London\n\n![](image)Santander Cycle Hire, near Victoria in Central London\nIn the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,[310] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.[311] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.[312]\n\n\n\n### Port and river boats[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.[260] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.[260]\n\n\nLondon has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.[313] At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.[314] The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.[315]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 miles (188 km) long.[316] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.[317]\n\n\n\n![](image)The hackney carriage (black cab) is a common sight on London streets. Although traditionally black, this is not a requirement with some painted in other colours or bearing advertising.\nThe Austin Motor Company began making hackney carriages (London taxis) in 1929, and models include Austin FX3 from 1948, Austin FX4 from 1958, with more recent models TXII and TX4 manufactured by London Taxis International. The BBC states, \"ubiquitous black cabs and red double-decker buses all have long and tangled stories that are deeply embedded in London's traditions\".[318]\n\n\nLondon is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[319] In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[320] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[321] Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars.[322]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in London\n\n### Tertiary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and higher education colleges in London\n\n![](image)University College London (UCL), established by Royal Charter in 1836, is one of the founding colleges of the University of London.\n![](image)Imperial College London, a technical research university in South Kensington\nLondon is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[19] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world[323] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world.[324] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.[325]\nA number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, Imperial College London is ranked No. 6 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 8th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 37th.[326] All are regularly ranked highly, with Imperial College being the UK's leading university in the Research Excellence Framework ranking 2021.[327] The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[328] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second-best in the world by the *Financial Times*.[329] The city is also home to three of the world's top ten performing arts schools (as ranked by the 2020 QS World University Rankings[330]): the Royal College of Music (ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th).[331]\n\n\nWith students in London and around 48,000 in University of London Worldwide,[332] the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK.[333] It includes five multi-faculty universities – City, King's College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.[334]\n\n\nUniversities in London outside the University of London system include Brunel University, Imperial College London,[note 1] Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe).[335] In addition, there are three international universities – Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University.\n\n\nLondon is home to five major medical schools – Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King's College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George's, University of London – and has many affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK's eight academic health science centres are based in the city – Imperial College Healthcare, King's Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe).[336] Additionally, many biomedical and biotechnology spin out companies from these research institutions are based around the city, most prominently in White City. Founded by pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale at St Thomas' Hospital in 1860, the first nursing school is now part of King's College London.[337] It was at King's in 1952 where a team led by Rosalind Franklin captured *Photo 51*, the critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.[338] There are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management.\n\n\n\n![](image)Opened in 1906, the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama is a member of Conservatoires UK and the Federation of Drama Schools.\nLondon is also home to many specialist arts education institutions, including the Central School of Ballet, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA), London Contemporary Dance School, National Centre for Circus Arts, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA; president Sir Kenneth Branagh), Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, the Royal College of Art, Sylvia Young Theatre School and Trinity Laban. The BRIT School in the London borough of Croydon provides training for the performing arts and technologies.[339]\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Centre for School Design\n\nThe majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow, St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School.\n\n\n\n### Royal Observatory, Greenwich and learned societies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tourists queuing to take pictures on the line of the historic prime meridian at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The observatory has played a major role in the history of navigation and astronomy.\nFounded in 1675, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was established to address the problem of calculating longitude for navigational purposes. This pioneering work in solving longitude featured in astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne's *Nautical Almanac* which made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point, and helped lead to the international adoption of Greenwich as the prime meridian (0° longitude) in 1884.[340]\n\n\nImportant scientific learned societies based in London include the Royal Society—the UK's national academy of sciences and the oldest national scientific institution in the world—founded in 1660,[341] and the Royal Institution, founded in 1799. Since 1825, the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures have presented scientific subjects to a general audience, and speakers have included aerospace engineer Frank Whittle, naturalist David Attenborough and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.[342]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of London\n\n### Leisure and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of annual events in London and West End theatre\n\nLeisure is a major part of the London economy. A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London[343] at 25.6 events per 1000 people.[344] The city is one of the four fashion capitals of the world, and, according to official statistics, is the world's third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city,[345] and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.[346]\n\n\n\n![](image)Harrods department store in Knightsbridge\nWithin the City of Westminster in London, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements.[347] London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated West End theatre since the late 20th century.[348] Agatha Christie's *The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, has been performed in the West End since 1952.[349] The Laurence Olivier Awards–named after Laurence Olivier–are given annually by the Society of London Theatre. The Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.[350]\n\n\nIslington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the UK.[351] Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. It is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including Selfridges flagship store.[352] Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west. Opened in 1760 with its flagship store on Regent Street since 1881, Hamleys is the oldest toy store in the world.[353] Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in Baker Street in 1835, an era viewed as being when London's tourism industry began.[354]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scene of the annual Notting Hill Carnival, 2014\nLondon is home to designers John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it one of the four international centres of fashion. Mary Quant designed the miniskirt in her King's Road boutique in Swinging Sixties London.[355] London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown.[356] There are Chinese takeaways throughout London, as are Indian restaurants which provide Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine.[357] Around 1860, the first fish and chips shop in London was opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in Bow.[318][358] The full English breakfast dates from the Victorian era, and many cafes in London serve a full English breakfast throughout the day.[359] London has five 3-Michelin star restaurants, including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea.[360] Many hotels in London provide a traditional afternoon tea service, such as the Oscar Wilde Lounge at the Hotel Café Royal in Piccadilly, and a themed tea service is also available, for example an *Alice in Wonderland* themed afternoon tea served at the Egerton House Hotel, and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* themed afternoon tea at One Aldwych in Covent Garden.[361][362] The nation's most popular biscuit to dunk in tea, chocolate digestives have been manufactured by McVitie's at their Harlesden factory in north-west London since 1925.[363]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's Globe is a modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.\nThere is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the city, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.[364] The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors.[365] First held in 1862, the RHS Chelsea Flower Show (run by the Royal Horticultural Society) takes place in May every year.[366]\n\n\n\n### LGBT scene[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LGBT culture in London\n\nThe first gay bar in London in the modern sense was The Cave of the Golden Calf, established as a night club in an underground location at 9 Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, in 1912 and \"which developed a reputation for sexual freedom and tolerance of same-sex relations.\"[367]\n\n\n\n![](image)Comptons of Soho during London Pride in 2010\nWhile London has been an LGBT tourism destination, after homosexuality was decriminalised in England in 1967 gay bar culture became more visible, and from the early 1970s Soho (and in particular Old Compton Street) became the centre of the London LGBT community.[368] G-A-Y, previously based at the Astoria, and now Heaven, is a long-running night club.[369]\n\n\nWider British cultural movements have influenced LGBT culture: for example, the emergence of glam rock in the UK in the early 1970s, via Marc Bolan and David Bowie, saw a generation of teenagers begin playing with the idea of androgyny, and the West End musical *The Rocky Horror Show*, which debuted in London in 1973, is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements.[370] The Blitz Kids (which included Boy George) frequented the Tuesday club-night at Blitz in Covent Garden, helping launch the New Romantic subcultural movement in the late 1970s.[371] Today, the annual London Pride Parade and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival are held in the city.[368]\n\n\n\n### Literature, film and television[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: London in fiction, London in film, List of television shows set in London, and London Television Archive\n\n![](image)Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B\nLondon has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century *Canterbury Tales* set out for Canterbury from London. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play *The Alchemist*, was set in the city.[372] *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.[372]\n\n\nThe literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has influenced people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[372] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[372] Robert Louis Stevenson mixed in London literary circles, and in 1886 he wrote the *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, a gothic novella set in Victorian London.[373] In 1898, H. G. Wells' sci-fi novel *The War of the Worlds* sees London (and the south of England) invaded by Martians.[374] Letitia Elizabeth Landon wrote *Calendar of the London Seasons* in 1834. Modern writers influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a \"biography\" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography. In the 1940s, George Orwell wrote essays in the *London Evening Standard*, most notably \"A Nice Cup of Tea\" (method for making tea) and \"The Moon Under Water\" (an ideal pub).[375] The WWII evacuation of children from London is depicted in C. S. Lewis' first Narnia book *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* (1950). On Christmas Eve 1925, Winnie-the-Pooh debuted in London's *Evening News*, with the character based on a stuffed toy A. A. Milne bought for his son Christopher Robin in Harrods.[376] In 1958, author Michael Bond created Paddington Bear, a refugee found in London Paddington station. A screen adaptation, *Paddington* (2014), features the calypso song \"London is the Place for Me\".[377]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**'Calendar of the London Seasons', by L.

The largest cinema chain in the country, Odeon Cinemas was founded in London in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch.[382] The British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) have been held in London since 1949, with the BAFTA Fellowship the Academy's highest accolade.[383] Founded in 1957, the BFI London Film Festival takes place over two weeks every October.[384]\n\n\nLondon is a major centre for television production, with studios including Television Centre, ITV Studios, Sky Campus and Fountain Studios; the latter hosted the original talent shows, *Pop Idol*, *The X Factor*, and *Britain's Got Talent*, before each format was exported around the world.[385][386] Formerly a franchise of ITV, Thames Television featured comedians such as Benny Hill and Rowan Atkinson (*Mr. Bean* was first screened by Thames), while Talkback produced *Da Ali G Show* which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G.[387] Many television shows have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera *EastEnders*.[388]\n\n\n\n### Museums, art galleries and libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Albertopolis. The Albert Memorial, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Geographical Society, and Royal College of Art are visible near the top; Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum at the lower end; Imperial College, Royal College of Music, and Science Museum lying in between.\nLondon is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753.[389] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.[390]\n\n\nThe British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom.[391] There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Abdus Salam Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King's, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.[392]\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as \"Albertopolis\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[393] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station which is accessed by pedestrians north of the Thames via the Millennium Bridge.[394]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Royal Albert Hall hosts concerts and musical events, including The Proms which are held every summer, as well as cinema screenings of films accompanied with live orchestral music.\nLondon is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, and countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms).[350] The Proms, an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music first held in 1895, ends with the Last Night of the Proms. London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera).[350] The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are in cathedrals and major churches—the church bells of St Clement Danes feature in the 1744 nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\".[395] Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban. The record label EMI was formed in the city in 1931, and an early employee for the company, Alan Blumlein, created stereo sound that year.[396]\n\n\n\n![](image)Abbey Road Studios in Abbey Road\nLondon has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world's busiest indoor venue, the O2 Arena,[397] and Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[350] Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, Lovebox and Hyde Park's British Summer Time, are held in London.[398]\n\n\nThe city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Queen, Eric Clapton, the Who, Cliff Richard, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple, T. Rex, the Police, Elvis Costello, Dire Straits, Cat Stevens, Fleetwood Mac, the Cure, Madness, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.[399][400]\n\n\nLondon was instrumental in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.[401][402] Other artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael, Kate Bush, Seal, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, the Prodigy, Gorillaz, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Dua Lipa and Florence and the Machine.[403] Artists from London played a prominent role in the development of synth-pop, including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and Eurythmics; the latter's \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was recorded in the attic of their north London home, heralding a trend for home recording methods.[404] Artists from London with a Caribbean influence include Hot Chocolate, Billy Ocean, Soul II Soul and Eddy Grant, with the latter fusing reggae, soul and samba with rock and pop.[405] London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of house, hip hop, and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards, the Brit Awards, are held in London.[406]\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and open spaces[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Parks and open spaces in London and Royal Parks of London\n\nSee also: List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London and List of local nature reserves in Greater London\n\n![](image)Hyde Park (with Kensington Gardens in foreground) has been a popular public space since it opened in 1637.\nA 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the \"greenest city\" in Europe with 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares) of public parks, woodlands and gardens.[407] The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north.[408] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[409] Primrose Hill is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.[410]\n\n\nClose to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park.[411] A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the southeast, and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the southwest. Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.[412]\n\n\nClose to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens, which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[413] There are also parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest,[414] both controlled by the City of London Corporation.[415] Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake.[416] Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.[414] Three of the UK's most-visited theme parks, Thorpe Park near Staines-upon-Thames, Chessington World of Adventures in Chessington and Legoland Windsor, are located within 20 miles (32 km) of London.[417]\n\n\n\n### Walking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Horse Ride is a tree tunnel (route overhung by trees) on the western side of Wimbledon Common.\nWalking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks.[418] Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some 28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail along the River Wandle.[419]\n\n\nOther long-distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (\"Loop\"), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.[418]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in London\n\nSee also: Football in London and Rugby union in London\n\n![](image)\nWembley Stadium, home of the England men and women's football team and the FA Cup Final, has a seating capacity of 90,000.

Since the 19th century,[11] the name \"London\" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3][14]\n\n\nAs one of the world's major global cities,[15] London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications.[16][17] Its GDP of €801.66 billion in 2017 makes it the largest urban economy in Europe,[18] and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,[19] it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[20][21] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world.[22] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.[23]\n\n\nLondon's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.[24] The 2023 population of Greater London of just under 10 million[25] made it Europe's third-most populous city,[26] accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United Kingdom[27] and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous in Europe, with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.[28][29] The London metropolitan area is the third-most populous in Europe, with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016,[note 4][30][31] granting London the status of a megacity.\n\n\nLondon has four World Heritage Sites: the Tower of London; Kew Gardens; the combined Palace of Westminster, Westminster Abbey, and St Margaret's Church; and also the historic settlement in Greenwich, where the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, defines the prime meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time.[32] Other landmarks include Buckingham Palace, the London Eye, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, and Trafalgar Square. London has many museums, galleries, libraries, and cultural venues, including the British Museum, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, Tate Modern, British Library, and numerous West End theatres.[33] Important sporting events held in London include the FA Cup Final, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, and the London Marathon. In 2012, London became the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games.[34]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Etymology of London\n\n*London* is an ancient name, attested in the first century AD, usually in the Latinised form *Londinium*.[35] Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources: Latin (usually *Londinium*), Old English (usually *Lunden*), and Welsh (usually *Llundein*), with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages. It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic; recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as \\**Londonjon* or something similar. This was adapted into Latin as *Londinium* and borrowed into Old English.[36]\n\n\nUntil 1889, the name \"London\" applied officially only to the City of London, but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London.[37]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of London\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of London.\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[38] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC.[38] In 2010, foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC,[39] were found on the Thames's south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge.[40] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the now-underground River Effra flows into the Thames.[40]\n\n\n\n### Roman London[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Londinium\n\n![](image)Reconstruction drawing of Londinium in 120 AD\nDespite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[41] This only lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground.[42]\n\n\nThe next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of about 60,000.[43]\n\n\n\n### Anglo-Saxon and Viking-period London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Lancastrian siege of London in 1471 is attacked by a Yorkist sally.\nWith the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450.[44] From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city.[45] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded; those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[46]\n\n\nThe Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in 886. The *Anglo-Saxon Chronicle* records that Alfred \"refounded\" London in 886. Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.[47]\n\n\nBy the 11th century, London was clearly the largest town in England. Westminster Abbey, rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, was one of the grandest churches in Europe. Winchester had been the capital of Anglo-Saxon England, but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war. In the view of Frank Stenton: \"It had the resources, and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self-consciousness appropriate to a national capital.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Westminster Abbey, as seen in this painting (by Canaletto, 1749), is a World Heritage Site and one of London's oldest and most important buildings.\nAfter winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William built the Tower of London, the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[51]\n\n\nIn the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of London, remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had grown to nearly 100,000.[52] With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third of its population.[53] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[54]\n\n\nLondon was a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290. Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[55] In 1264 during the Second Barons' War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[56]\n\n\n\n### Early modern[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of London in 1593. There is only one bridge across the Thames, but parts of Southwark on the south bank of the river have been developed.\nDuring the Tudor period, the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism. Much of London property passed from church to private ownership, which accelerated trade and business in the city.[57] In 1475, the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base (*kontor*) of England in London, called the *Stalhof* or *Steelyard*. It remained until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway.[58] Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries.[59]\n\n\nYet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north-west Europe. The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps; any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan. The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January 1565 spurred a burst of commercial activity.[60] The Royal Exchange was founded.[61] Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World. London became the main North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from about 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.[57]\n\n\nIn the 16th century, William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London during English Renaissance theatre. Shakespeare's Globe Theatre was constructed in 1599 in Southwark. Stage performances came to a halt in London when Puritan authorities shut down the theatres in the 1640s and 1650s.[62] The ban on theatre was lifted during the Restoration in 1660, and London's oldest operating theatre, Drury Lane, opened in 1663 in what is now the West End theatre district.[63]\n\n\nBy the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still compact. There was an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, in the Gunpowder Plot of 5 November 1605.[64] In 1637, the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the London area. This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city. Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London, coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power, caused the Corporation's \"The Great Refusal\", a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City.[65]\n\n\nIn the English Civil War, the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause. After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.[66]\nThe fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in 1647,[67] and they were levelled by Parliament the same year.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Fire of London destroyed many parts of the city in 1666.\nLondon was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,[69] culminating in the Great Plague of 1665–1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.[69]\n\n\nThe Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.[70] Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by polymath Robert Hooke.[71] In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral, was completed. During the Georgian era, new districts such as Mayfair were formed in the west; new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded downstream. London's development as an international financial centre matured for much of the 18th century.[72]\n\n\nIn 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House, which was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was said to be dogged by crime,[73] and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force.[74] Epidemics during the 1720s and 30s saw most children born in the city die before reaching their fifth birthday.[75]\n\n\nCoffee-houses became a popular place to debate ideas, as growing literacy and development of the printing press made news widely available, with Fleet Street becoming the centre of the British press. The invasion of Amsterdam by Napoleonic armies led many financiers to relocate to London and the first London international issue was arranged in 1817. Around the same time, the Royal Navy became the world's leading war fleet, acting as a major deterrent to potential economic adversaries. The repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 was specifically aimed at weakening Dutch economic power. London then overtook Amsterdam as the leading international financial centre.[76]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nWith the onset of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, an unprecedented growth in urbanisation took place, and the number of High Streets (the primary street for retail in Britain) rapidly grew.[77][78] London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925, with a population density of 802 per acre (325 per hectare).[79] In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods, such as Harding, Howell & Co.—one of the first department stores—located on Pall Mall, the streets had scores of street sellers.[77] London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics, claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866.[80] Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties; it was abolished in 1889 when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital.[81]\n\n\nFrom the early years of the 20th century onwards, teashops were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain, with Lyons, who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in 1894, leading the way.[82] The tearooms, such as the Criterion in Piccadilly, became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement.[83] The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign, between 1912 and 1914, which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral bombed.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBritish volunteer recruits in London, August 1914, during World War I\n![](image)\nA bombed-out London street during the Blitz, World War II\n\nLondon was bombed by the Germans in the First World War, and during the Second World War, the Blitz and other bombings by the German *Luftwaffe* killed over 30,000 Londoners, destroying large tracts of housing and other buildings across the city.[85] The tomb of the Unknown Warrior, an unidentified member of the British armed forces killed during the First World War, was buried in Westminster Abbey on 11 November 1920.[86] The Cenotaph, located in Whitehall, was unveiled on the same day, and is the focal point for the National Service of Remembrance held annually on Remembrance Sunday, the closest Sunday to 11 November.[87]\n\n\nThe 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, while London was still recovering from the war.[88] From the 1940s, London became home to many immigrants, primarily from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan,[89] making London one of the most diverse cities in the world. In 1951, the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank.[90] The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the \"pea soup fogs\" for which London had been notorious, and had earned it the nickname the \"Big Smoke\".[91]\n\n\nStarting mainly in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London sub-culture associated with the King's Road, Chelsea and Carnaby Street.[92] The role of trendsetter revived in the punk era.[93] In 1965 London's political boundaries were expanded in response to the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created.[94] During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, London was hit from 1973 by bomb attacks by the Provisional Irish Republican Army.[95] These attacks lasted for two decades, starting with the Old Bailey bombing.[95] Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981 Brixton riot.[96]\n\n\nGreater London's population declined in the decades after the Second World War, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s.[97] The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration, including the Canary Wharf development. This was born out of London's increasing role as an international financial centre in the 1980s.[98] Located about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of central London, the Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea.[99]\n\n\nThe Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, leaving London with no central administration until 2000 and the creation of the Greater London Authority.[100] To mark the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed.[101] On 6 July 2005 London was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics, as the first city to stage the Olympic Games three times.[34] On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in a series of terrorist attacks.[95]\n\n\nIn 2008, *Time* named London alongside New York City and Hong Kong as Nylonkong, hailing them as the world's three most influential global cities.[102] In January 2015, Greater London's population was estimated to be 8.63 million, its highest since 1939.[103] During the Brexit referendum in 2016, the UK as a whole decided to leave the European Union, but most London constituencies voted for remaining.[104] However, Britain's exit from the EU in early 2021 only marginally weakened London's position as an international financial centre.[105]\n\n\nOn 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III and his wife, Camilla, as king and queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, took place at Westminster Abbey, London.[106]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local government in London, History of local government in London, and List of heads of London government\n\n![](image)Arms of the Corporation of the City of London[107]\nThe administration of London is formed of two tiers: a citywide, strategic tier and a local tier. Citywide administration is coordinated by the Greater London Authority (GLA), while local administration is carried out by 33 smaller authorities.[108] The GLA consists of two elected components: the mayor of London, who has executive powers, and the London Assembly, which scrutinises the mayor's decisions and can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals each year. The GLA has responsibility for the majority of London's transport system through its functional arm Transport for London (TfL), it is responsible for overseeing the city's police and fire services, and also for setting a strategic vision for London on a range of issues.[109] The headquarters of the GLA is City Hall, Newham. The mayor since 2016 has been Sadiq Khan, the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital.[110] The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011.[111]\n\n\nThe local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.[112] They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, libraries, leisure and recreation, social services, local roads and refuse collection.[113] Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through joint arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).[114]\n\n\nThe London Fire Brigade is the statutory fire and rescue service for Greater London, run by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority. It is the third largest fire service in the world.[115] National Health Service ambulance services are provided by the London Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the largest free-at-the-point-of-use emergency ambulance service in the world.[116] The London Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction with the LAS where required. Her Majesty's Coastguard and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, which is under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Authority from Teddington Lock to the sea.[117]\n\n\n\n### National government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)10 Downing Street, official residence of the Prime Minister\nLondon is the seat of the Government of the United Kingdom. Many government departments, as well as the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street, are based close to the Palace of Westminster, particularly along Whitehall.[118] There are 73 members of Parliament (MPs) from London; As of December 2019[update], 49 are from the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, and three are Liberal Democrats.[119] The ministerial post of minister for London was created in 1994 and as of 2020 is held by Paul Scully.[120]\n\n\n\n### Policing and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in London\n\nPolicing in Greater London, with the exception of the City of London, is provided by the Metropolitan Police (\"The Met\"), overseen by the mayor through the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).[121] The Met is also referred to as Scotland Yard after the location of its original headquarters in a road called Great Scotland Yard in Whitehall. The City of London has its own police force – the City of London Police.[122] First worn by Met police officers in 1863, the custodian helmet has been called a \"cultural icon\" and a \"symbol of British law enforcement\".[123] Introduced by the Met in 1929, the blue police telephone box (basis for the TARDIS in *Doctor Who*) was once a common sight throughout London and regional cities in the UK.[124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, at the SIS Building. Scenes featuring James Bond (the fictional MI6 agent) have been filmed here.\nThe British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Tramlink services.[125]\nThe Ministry of Defence Police is a special police force in London, which does not generally become involved with policing the general public.[126] The UK's domestic counter-intelligence service (MI5) is headquartered in Thames House on the north bank of the River Thames, and the foreign intelligence service (MI6) is headquartered in the SIS Building on the south bank.[127]\n\n\nCrime rates vary widely across different areas of London. Crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level.[128] In 2015, there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014.[129]\nRecorded crime has been rising in London, notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen. There were 50 murders from the start of 2018 to mid April 2018. Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this, though other factors are involved.[130] However, the murder rate in London is much lower than other major cities around the world.[131]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of London\n\n### Scope[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of London in June 2018\nLondon, also known as Greater London, is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city's metropolis. The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement, but as its urban area grew, the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs, causing \"London\" to be defined several ways.[132]\n\n\nForty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town, in which 'LONDON' forms part of postal addresses.[133] The London telephone area code (020) covers a larger area, similar in size to Greater London, although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included. The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M25 motorway in places.[134]\n\n\nFurther urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt, although the built-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, producing a separately defined Greater London Urban Area. Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt.[135] Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London,[136] and by the River Thames into North and South, with an informal central London area. The coordinates of the nominal centre of London, traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall, are about 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W﻿ / ﻿51.50722°N 0.12750°W﻿ / 51.50722; -0.12750.[137]\n\n\n\n### Status[edit]\n\n\nWithin London, both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status and both the City of London and the remainder of Greater London are counties for the purposes of lieutenancies.[138] The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire.[139] London's status as the capital of England, and later the United Kingdom, has never been granted or confirmed by statute or in written form.[note 5]\n\n\nIts status as a capital was established by constitutional convention, which means its status as *de facto* capital is a part of the UK's uncodified constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation.[142] More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as *London*.[143]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)London from Primrose Hill\nGreater London encompasses a total area of 611 square miles (1,583 km2) an area which had a population of 7,172,036 in 2001 and a population density of 11,760 inhabitants per square mile (4,542/km2). The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a total area of 3,236 square miles (8,382 km2) has a population of 13,709,000 and a population density of 3,900 inhabitants per square mile (1,510/km2).[144]\n\n\nModern London stands on the Thames, its primary geographical feature, a navigable river which crosses the city from the south-west to the east. The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, and Primrose Hill. Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames. The Thames was once a much broader, shallower river with extensive marshlands; at high tide, its shores reached five times their present width.[145]\n\n\nSince the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked, and many of its London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding.[146] The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow 'tilting' of the British Isles as a result of post-glacial rebound.[147]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of London\n\n\n\n| London, England\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 59\n\n\n\n8\n\n3\n | 45\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n | 39\n\n\n\n12\n\n4\n | 42\n\n\n\n15\n\n6\n | 46\n\n\n\n18\n\n9\n | 47\n\n\n\n22\n\n12\n | 46\n\n\n\n24\n\n14\n | 53\n\n\n\n23\n\n14\n | 50\n\n\n\n20\n\n12\n | 65\n\n\n\n16\n\n9\n | 67\n\n\n\n11\n\n5\n | 57\n\n\n\n9\n\n3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 2.3\n\n\n\n47\n\n37\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n48\n\n37\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n53\n\n39\n | 1.7\n\n\n\n59\n\n43\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n48\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n71\n\n54\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n75\n\n58\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n57\n | 2\n\n\n\n68\n\n53\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n60\n\n48\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n53\n\n41\n | 2.2\n\n\n\n48\n\n38\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nLondon has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*). Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least 1697, when records began at Kew. At Kew, the most rainfall in one month is 7.4 inches (189 mm) in November 1755 and the least is 0 inches (0 mm) in both December 1788 and July 1800. Mile End also had 0 inches (0 mm) in April 1893.[148] The wettest year on record is 1903, with a total fall of 38.1 inches (969 mm) and the driest is 1921, with a total fall of 12.1 inches (308 mm).[149] The average annual precipitation amounts to about 600 mm, which is half the annual rainfall of New York City.[150] Despite its relatively low annual precipitation, London still receives 109.6 rainy days on the 1.0 mm threshold annually. However, London is vulnerable to climate change in the United Kingdom, and there is increasing concern among hydrological experts that London households may run out of water before 2050.[151]\n\n\nTemperature extremes in London range from 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) at Heathrow on 19 July 2022 down to −17.4 °C (0.7 °F) at Northolt on 13 December 1981.[152][153] Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since 1692. The highest pressure ever reported is 1,049.8 millibars (31.00 inHg) on 20 January 2020.[154]\n\n\nSummers are generally warm, sometimes hot. London's average July high is 23.5 °C (74.3 °F). On average each year, London experiences 31 days above 25 °C (77.0 °F) and 4.2 days above 30.0 °C (86.0 °F). During the 2003 European heat wave, prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat-related deaths.[155] A previous spell of 15 consecutive days above 32.2 °C (90.0 °F) in England in 1976 also caused many heat related deaths.[156] A previous temperature of 37.8 °C (100.0 °F) in August 1911 at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non-standard.[157] Droughts can also, occasionally, be a problem, especially in summer, most recently in summer 2018, and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December.[158] However, the most consecutive days without rain was 73 days in the spring of 1893.[159]\n\n\nWinters are generally cool with little temperature variation. Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter. Spring and autumn can be pleasant. As a large city, London has a considerable urban heat island effect,[160] making the centre of London at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs and outskirts.[161]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for London (LHR),[note 6] elevation: 25 m (82 ft), 1991–2020 normals\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 40.2(104.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 4.1(39.4)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −16.1(3.0)\n | −13.9(7.0)\n | −8.9(16.0)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −0.6(30.9)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −7.1(19.2)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n | −17.4(0.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 58.8(2.31)\n | 45.0(1.77)\n | 38.8(1.53)\n | 42.3(1.67)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 47.3(1.86)\n | 45.8(1.80)\n | 52.8(2.08)\n | 49.6(1.95)\n | 65.1(2.56)\n | 66.6(2.62)\n | 57.1(2.25)\n | 615.0(24.21)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 11.5\n | 9.5\n | 8.5\n | 8.8\n | 8.0\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.4\n | 7.9\n | 10.8\n | 11.2\n | 10.8\n | 111.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 80\n | 77\n | 70\n | 65\n | 67\n | 65\n | 65\n | 69\n | 73\n | 78\n | 81\n | 81\n | 73\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3(37)\n | 2(36)\n | 2(36)\n | 4(39)\n | 7(45)\n | 10(50)\n | 12(54)\n | 12(54)\n | 10(50)\n | 9(48)\n | 6(43)\n | 3(37)\n | 7(44)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 61.1\n | 78.8\n | 124.5\n | 176.7\n | 207.5\n | 208.4\n | 217.8\n | 202.1\n | 157.1\n | 115.2\n | 70.7\n | 55.0\n | 1,674.8\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 23\n | 28\n | 31\n | 40\n | 41\n | 41\n | 42\n | 45\n | 40\n | 35\n | 27\n | 21\n | 35\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 3\n |\n| Source 1: Met Office[162][163][164] Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute[165][166] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[167] CEDA Archive[168] TORRO[169] Time and Date[170]\nSee Climate of London for additional climate information.\n |\n\n1. **^** London is not a city in the usual UK sense of having city status granted by the Crown.\n2. **^** See also: Independent city § National capitals\n3. **^** The Greater London Authority consists of the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.

These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)The West End theatre district in 2016\nSuch names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries. Since 1965, Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.[172] The City of London is the main financial district,[173] and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east.\n\n\nThe West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists.[174] West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds.[175] The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over £2 million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London.[176][177]\n\n\nThe East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London.[178] The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which was developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.[178]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of London, List of tallest buildings and structures in London, and List of demolished buildings and structures in London\n\n![](image)The Tower of London, a medieval castle, dating in part to 1078\nLondon's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, partly because of their varying ages. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings. Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace.[179]\n\n\nPart of the varied architectural heritage are the 17th-century churches by Christopher Wren, neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England, to the early 20th century Old Bailey courthouse and the 1960s Barbican Estate. The 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the south-west is a local landmark, while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.[180] The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf, high residential densities in inner London, and lower densities in Outer London.\n\n\n\n![](image)The east wing public façade of Buckingham Palace was built between 1847 and 1850; it was remodelled to its present form in 1913.\n![](image)Trafalgar Square and its fountains, with Nelson's Column on the right\nThe Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane, respectively, have royal connections, as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column (built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson) is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square, one of the focal points of central London. Older buildings are mainly brick, commonly the yellow London stock brick.[181]\n\n\nIn the dense areas, most of the concentration is via medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers, such as 30 St Mary Axe (dubbed \"The Gherkin\"), Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square, are mostly in the two financial districts, the City of London and Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral and other historic buildings.[182] This protective policy, known as 'St Paul's Heights', has been in operation by the City of London since 1937.[182] Nevertheless, there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London, including the 95-storey Shard London Bridge, the tallest building in the United Kingdom and Western Europe.[183]\n\n\nOther notable modern buildings include The Scalpel, 20 Fenchurch Street (dubbed \"The Walkie-Talkie\"), the former City Hall in Southwark, the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross and No 1 Poultry by James Stirling. The BT Tower stands at 620 feet (189 m) and has a 360 degree coloured LED screen near the top. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, by the Thames to the east of Canary Wharf, is now an entertainment venue called the O2 Arena.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Houses of Parliament and Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben) on the right foreground, the London Eye on the left foreground and The Shard with Canary Wharf in the background; seen in September 2014\n\n### Natural history[edit]\n\n\nThe London Natural History Society suggests that London is \"one of the World's Greenest Cities\" with more than 40 per cent green space or open water. They indicate that 2000 species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports 120 species of fish.[185] They state that over 60 species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded 47 species of butterfly, 1173 moths and more than 270 kinds of spider around London. London's wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds. London has 38 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), two national nature reserves and 76 local nature reserves.[186]\n\n\nAmphibians are common in the capital, including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and common frogs, common toads, palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, barred grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)A fox on Ayres Street, Southwark, South London\nAmong other inhabitants of London are 10,000 red foxes, so that there are now 16 foxes for every square mile (6 per square kilometre) of London. Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog, brown rat, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, and grey squirrel.[188] In wilder areas of Outer London, such as Epping Forest, a wide variety of mammals are found, including European hare, badger, field, bank and water vole, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, mole, shrew, and weasel, in addition to red fox, grey squirrel and hedgehog. A dead otter was found at The Highway, in Wapping, about a mile from the Tower Bridge, which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city.[189] Ten of England's eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest: soprano, Nathusius' and common pipistrelles, common noctule, serotine, barbastelle, Daubenton's, brown long-eared, Natterer's and Leisler's.[190]\n\n\nHerds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained.[191] Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.[192]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demography of London\n\n\n\n2021 Census - Population of London by country of birth[193]\n| Country of Birth | Population | Percent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) United Kingdom | 5,223,986 | 59.4\n |\n| Non-United Kingdom | 3,575,739 | 40.6\n |\n|  | ![](image) India | 322,644 | 3.7\n |\n| ![](image) Romania | 175,991 | 2.0\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | 149,397 | 1.7\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 138,895 | 1.6\n |\n| ![](image) Pakistan | 129,774 | 1.5\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 126,059 | 1.4\n |\n| ![](image) Nigeria | 117,145 | 1.3\n |\n| ![](image) Ireland | 96,566 | 1.1\n |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 80,379 | 0.9\n |\n| ![](image) France | 77,715 | 0.9\n |\n| Others | 2,161,174 | 24.6\n |\n| Total | 8,799,725 | 100.0\n |\n\n\n![](image)Population density map\nThe 2021 census recorded that 3,575,739 people or 40.6% of London's population were foreign-born,[194] making it among the cities with the largest immigrant population in terms of absolute numbers. About 69% of children born in London in 2015 had at least one parent who was born abroad.[195]\n\n\nThe population then grew by just over a million between the 2001 and 2011 Censuses, to reach 8,173,941 in the latter.[196] London's continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered 9,787,426 people in 2011,[29] while its wider metropolitan area had a population of 12–14 million, depending on the definition used.[197] According to Eurostat, London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe. A net 726,000 immigrants arrived there in the period 1991–2001.[198]\n\n\nThe region covers 610 square miles (1,579 km2), giving a population density of 13,410 inhabitants per square mile (5,177/km2)[144] more than ten times that of any other British region.[199] In population terms, London is the 19th largest city and the 18th largest metropolitan region.[200]\n\n\n\n### Age structure and median age[edit]\n\n\nChildren younger than 14 constituted 20.6% of the population in Outer London in 2018, and 18% in Inner London. The 15–24 age group was 11.1% in Outer and 10.2% in Inner London, those aged 25–44 years 30.6% in Outer London and 39.7% in Inner London, those aged 45–64 years 24% and 20.7% in Outer and Inner London respectively. Those aged 65 and over are 13.6% in Outer London, but only 9.3% in Inner London.[201]\n\n\nThe median age of London's residents in 2018 was 36.5, which was younger than the UK median of 40.3.[201]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in London\n\nMaps of Greater London showing percentage distribution of selected ethnic groups according to the 2021 Census\n![White](image)\nWhite (53.8%)\n![Asian](image)\nAsian (20.8%)\n![Black](image)\nBlack (13.5%)\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, based on 2011 Census estimates, 59.8 per cent of the 8,173,941 inhabitants of London were White, with 44.9% White British, 2.2% White Irish, 0.1% gypsy/Irish traveller and 12.1% classified as Other White.[202] Meanwhile, 20.9% of Londoners were of Asian or mixed-Asian descent, with 19.7% being of full Asian descents and 1.2% being of mixed-Asian heritage. Indians accounted for 6.6% of the population, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis at 2.7% each. Chinese people accounted for 1.5%, and Arabs for 1.3%. A further 4.9% were classified as \"Other Asian\".[202]\n\n\n15.6% of London's population were of Black or mixed-Black descent. 13.3% were of full Black descent, with persons of mixed-Black heritage comprising 2.3%. Black Africans accounted for 7.0% of London's population; 4.2% identified as Black Caribbean, and 2.1% as \"Other Black\". 5.0% were of mixed race.[202] The history of African presence extends back to the Roman period.[203]\n\n\nAs of 2007, one fifth of primary school students across London were from ethnic minorities.[204] Altogether at the 2011 census, of London's 1,624,768 population aged 0 to 15, 46.4% were White, 19.8% Asian, 19% Black, 10.8% Mixed and 4% another ethnic group.[205] In January 2005, a survey of London's ethnic and religious diversity claimed that more than 300 languages were spoken in London and more than 50 non-indigenous communities had populations of more than 10,000.[206] Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that in 2021[update], London's foreign-born population was 3,346,000 (35%), up from 1,630,000 in 1997.[207]\n\n\nThe 2011 census showed that 36.7% of Greater London's population were born outside the UK.[208] Estimates by the Office for National Statistics indicate that the five largest foreign-born groups living in London from July 2009 to June 2010 were born in India, Poland, Ireland, Bangladesh and Nigeria.[209] In the 2021 census 40.6% of London residents were foreign-born.[194] The ethnic demographics of the 2021 census were reported as 53.8% White, with White British reported at 36.8%, Asian or Asian British at 20.8%, Black or Black British at 13.5%, mixed 5.7% and other at 6.3%.[210]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in London\n\nSee also: List of churches in London\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, the largest religious groupings were Christians (48.4%), followed by those of no religion (20.7%), Muslims (12.4%), no response (8.5%), Hindus (5.0%), Jews (1.8%), Sikhs (1.5%), Buddhists (1.0%) and other (0.6%).[211]\n\n\nLondon has traditionally been Christian, and has a large number of churches, particularly in the City of London. The well-known St Paul's Cathedral in the City and Southwark Cathedral south of the river are Anglican administrative centres,[212] while the Archbishop of Canterbury, principal bishop of the Church of England and worldwide Anglican Communion, has his main residence at Lambeth Palace in the London Borough of Lambeth.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSt Paul's Cathedral, the seat of the Bishop of London\n![](image)\nThe BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London is the second-largest Hindu temple in England and Europe.\n\nImportant national and royal ceremonies are shared between St Paul's and Westminster Abbey.[214] The Abbey is not to be confused with nearby Westminster Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in England and Wales.[215] Despite the prevalence of Anglican churches, observance is low within the denomination. Anglican Church attendance continues a long, steady decline, according to Church of England statistics.[216]\n\n\nNotable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, which is allowed to give the Islamic call to prayer through loudspeakers, the London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park[217] and the Baitul Futuh of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. After the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Middle-Eastern Arab Muslims based themselves around Mayfair, Kensington and Knightsbridge in West London.[218][219][220] There are large Bengali Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham.[221]\n\n\nLarge Hindu communities are found in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter hosting what was until 2006[222] Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple.[223] London is home to 44 Hindu temples, including the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London. There are Sikh communities in East and West London, particularly in Southall, home to one of the largest Sikh populations and the largest Sikh temple outside India.[224]\n\n\nThe majority of British Jews live in London, with notable Jewish communities in Stamford Hill, Stanmore, Golders Green, Finchley, Hampstead, Hendon and Edgware, all in North London. Bevis Marks Synagogue in the City of London is affiliated to London's historic Sephardic Jewish community. It is the only synagogue in Europe to have held regular services continually for over 300 years. Stanmore and Canons Park Synagogue has the largest membership of any Orthodox synagogue in Europe.[225] The London Jewish Forum was set up in 2006 in response to the growing significance of devolved London Government.[226]\n\n\n\n### Accents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Traditionally, anyone born within earshot of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church was considered to be a true Cockney.[227]\nCockney is an accent heard across London, mainly spoken by working-class and lower-middle class Londoners. It is mainly attributed to the East End and wider East London, having originated there in the 18th century, although it has been suggested that the Cockney style of speech is much older.[228] Some features of Cockney include, *Th*-fronting (pronouncing \"th\" as \"f\"), \"th\" inside a word is pronounced with a \"v\", *H*-dropping, and, like most English accents, a Cockney accent drops the \"r\" after a vowel.[229] John Camden Hotten, in his *Slang Dictionary* of 1859, makes reference to Cockney \"use of a peculiar slang language\" (Cockney rhyming slang) when describing the costermongers of the East End. Since the start of the 21st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself, with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties.[230]\n\n\nEstuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation.[231] It is widely spoken by people of all classes.[232]\n\n\nMulticultural London English (MLE) is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in multicultural areas amongst young, working-class people from diverse backgrounds. It is a fusion of an array of ethnic accents, in particular Afro-Caribbean and South Asian, with a significant Cockney influence.[233]\n\n\nReceived Pronunciation (RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[234] It has no specific geographical correlate,[235] although it is also traditionally defined as the standard speech used in London and south-eastern England.[236] It is mainly spoken by upper-class and upper-middle class Londoners.[237]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of London\n\n![](image)The City of London, one of the largest financial centres in the world[238]\nLondon's gross regional product in 2019 was £503 billion, around a quarter of UK GDP.[239] London has five major business districts: the city, Westminster, Canary Wharf, Camden & Islington and Lambeth & Southwark. One way to get an idea of their relative importance is to look at relative amounts of office space: Greater London had 27 million m2 of office space in 2001, and the City contains the most space, with 8 million m2 of office space. London has some of the highest real estate prices in the world.[240] London is the world's most expensive office market according to world property journal (2015) report.[241] As of 2015[update] the residential property in London is worth $2.2 trillion.[242] The city has the highest property prices of any European city according to the Office for National Statistics and the European Office of Statistics.[243] On average the price per square metre in central London is €24,252 (April 2014). This is higher than the property prices in other G8 European capital cities.[244]\n\n\n\n### City of London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square and Temple Bar\n![](image)The Royal Exchange in 1886\nLondon's finance industry is based in the City of London and Canary Wharf, the two major business districts. London is one of the pre-eminent financial centres of the world as the most important location for international finance.[245] London took over as a major financial centre shortly after 1795 when the Dutch Republic collapsed before the Napoleonic armies. For many bankers established in Amsterdam (e.g. Hope, Baring), this was only time to move to London. Also, London's market-centred system (as opposed to the bank-centred one in Amsterdam) grew more dominant in the 18th century.[72] The London financial elite was strengthened by a strong Jewish community from all over Europe capable of mastering the most sophisticated financial tools of the time.[76] This economic strength of the city was attributed to its diversity.[246][247]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bank of England, established in 1694, is the model on which most modern central banks are based.\nBy the mid-19th century, London was the leading financial centre, and at the end of the century over half the world's trade was financed in British currency.[248] Still, as of 2016[update] London tops the world rankings on the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI),[249] and it ranked second in A.T. Kearney's 2018 Global Cities Index.[250]\n\n\nLondon's largest industry is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to the UK's balance of payments. Around 325,000 people were employed in financial services in London until mid-2007. London has over 480 overseas banks, more than any other city in the world. It is the world's biggest currency trading centre, accounting for some 37 per cent of the $5.1 trillion average daily volume, according to the BIS.[251] Over 85 per cent (3.2 million) of the employed population of greater London works in the services industries. Because of its prominent global role, London's economy had been affected by the financial crisis of 2007–2008. However, by 2010 the city had recovered, put in place new regulatory powers, proceeded to regain lost ground and re-established London's economic dominance.[252] Along with professional services headquarters, the City of London is home to the Bank of England, London Stock Exchange, and Lloyd's of London insurance market.[253]\n\n\nOver half the UK's top 100 listed companies (the FTSE 100) and over 100 of Europe's 500 largest companies have their headquarters in central London. Over 70 per cent of the FTSE 100 are within London's metropolitan area, and 75 per cent of Fortune 500 companies have offices in London.[254] In a 1992 report commissioned by the London Stock Exchange, Sir Adrian Cadbury, chairman of his family's confectionery company Cadbury, produced the Cadbury Report, a code of best practice which served as a basis for reform of corporate governance around the world.[255]\n\n\n\n### Media and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in London\n\n![](image)Broadcasting House in central London, headquarters of the BBC\nMedia companies are concentrated in London, and the media distribution industry is London's second most competitive sector.[256] The BBC, the world's oldest national broadcaster, is a significant employer, while other broadcasters also have headquarters around the city. Many national newspapers, including *The Times*, founded in 1785, are edited in London; the term Fleet Street (where most national newspapers operated) remains a metonym for the British national press. London is one of the world's largest retail destinations, with the city frequently ranking at or near the top of retail sales of any city.[257][258] In 2017 it was ranked the top city for luxury store openings.[259] The Port of London is the second largest in the UK, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.[260]\n\n\nA growing number of technology companies are based in London, notably in East London Tech City, also known as Silicon Roundabout. In 2014 the city was among the first to receive a geoTLD.[261] In February 2014 London was ranked as the European City of the Future in the 2014/15 list by *fDi Intelligence*.[262] A museum in Bletchley Park, where Alan Turing was based during World War II, is in Bletchley, 40 miles (64 km) north of central London, as is The National Museum of Computing.[263]\n\n\nThe gas and electricity distribution networks that manage and operate the towers, cables and pressure systems that deliver energy to consumers across the city are managed by National Grid plc, SGN[264] and UK Power Networks.[265]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in London\n\n![](image)\nThe British Museum\n![](image)\nThe National Gallery\n\nLondon is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world and in 2015 was ranked as the most visited city in the world with over 65 million visits.[266] It is also the top city in the world by visitor cross-border spending, estimated at US$20.23 billion in 2015.[267] Tourism is one of London's prime industries, employing 700,000 full-time workers in 2016, and contributes £36 billion a year to the economy.[268] The city accounts for 54% of all inbound visitor spending in the UK.[269] As of 2016[update] London was the world top city destination as ranked by TripAdvisor users.[270]\n\n\nIn 2015 the top most-visited attractions in the UK were all in London. The top 10 most visited attractions were: (with visits per venue)[271]\n\n\n\n1. British Museum: 6,820,686\n2. National Gallery: 5,908,254\n3. Natural History Museum (South Kensington): 5,284,023\n4. Southbank Centre: 5,102,883\n5. Tate Modern: 4,712,581\n6. Victoria and Albert Museum (South Kensington): 3,432,325\n7. Science Museum: 3,356,212\n8. Somerset House: 3,235,104\n9. Tower of London: 2,785,249\n10. National Portrait Gallery: 2,145,486\n\n\nThe number of hotel rooms in London in 2015 stood at 138,769, and is expected to grow over the years.[272]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in London and Infrastructure in London\n\nTransport is one of the four main areas of policy administered by the Mayor of London,[273] but the mayor's financial control does not extend to the longer-distance rail network that enters London. In 2007 the Mayor of London assumed responsibility for some local lines, which now form the London Overground network, adding to the existing responsibility for the London Underground, trams and buses. The public transport network is administered by Transport for London (TfL).[109]\n\n\nThe lines that formed the London Underground, as well as trams and buses, became part of an integrated transport system in 1933 when the London Passenger Transport Board or *London Transport* was created. Transport for London is now the statutory corporation responsible for most aspects of the transport system in Greater London, and is run by a board and a commissioner appointed by the Mayor of London.[274]\n\n\n\n### Aviation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Airports of London\n\n![](image)Heathrow Airport is the busiest airport in Europe as well as the second busiest in the world for international passenger traffic (Terminal 5C is pictured).\nLondon is a major international air transport hub with the busiest city airspace in the world. Eight airports use the word *London* in their name, but most traffic passes through six of these. Additionally, various other airports also serve London, catering primarily to general aviation flights.\n\n\n\n* Heathrow Airport, in Hillingdon, West London, was for many years the busiest airport in the world for international traffic, and is the major hub of the nation's flag carrier, British Airways.[275] In March 2008 its fifth terminal was opened.[276]\n* Gatwick Airport, south of London in West Sussex, handles flights to more destinations than any other UK airport and is the main base of easyJet, the UK's largest airline by number of passengers.[277]\n* Stansted Airport, north-east of London in Essex, has flights that serve the greatest number of European destinations of any UK airport and is the main base of Ryanair, the world's largest international airline by number of international passengers.[278]\n* Luton Airport, to the north of London in Bedfordshire, is used by several budget airlines (especially easyJet and Wizz Air) for short-haul flights.[279]\n* London City Airport, the most central airport and the one with the shortest runway, in Newham, East London, is focused on business travellers, with a mixture of full-service short-haul scheduled flights and considerable business jet traffic.[280]\n* Southend Airport, east of London in Essex, is a smaller, regional airport that caters for short-haul flights on a limited, though growing, number of airlines.[281] In 2017, international passengers made up over 95% of the total at Southend, the highest proportion of any London airport.[282]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n#### Underground and DLR[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The London Underground is the world's oldest and third-longest rapid transit system.\nOpened in 1863, the London Underground, commonly referred to as the Tube or just the Underground, is the oldest and third longest metro system in the world.[283][284] The system serves 272 stations, and was formed from several private companies, including the world's first underground electric line, the City and South London Railway, which opened in 1890.[285]\n\n\nOver four million journeys are made every day on the Underground network, over 1 billion each year.[286] An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5 billion (€7.7 billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.[287] The Docklands Light Railway (DLR), which opened in 1987, is a second, more local metro system using smaller and lighter tram-type vehicles that serve the Docklands, Greenwich and Lewisham.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Suburban[edit]\n\n\nThere are 368 railway stations in the London Travelcard Zones on an extensive above-ground suburban railway network. South London, particularly, has a high concentration of railways as it has fewer Underground lines. Most rail lines terminate around the centre of London, running into eighteen terminal stations, with the exception of the Thameslink trains connecting Bedford in the north and Brighton in the south via Luton and Gatwick airports.[289] London has Britain's busiest station by number of passengers—Waterloo, with over 184 million people using the interchange station complex (which includes Waterloo East station) each year.[290] Clapham Junction is one of Europe's busiest rail interchanges.[291]\n\n\nWith the need for more rail capacity, the Elizabeth Line (also known as Crossrail) opened in May 2022.[292] It is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the Home Counties with a branch to Heathrow Airport.[293] It was Europe's biggest construction project, with a £15 billion projected cost.[294]\n\n\n\n#### Inter-city and international[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St Pancras International is the main terminal for high-speed Eurostar and High Speed 1 services, as well as commuter suburban Thameslink and inter-city East Midlands Railway services.\nLondon is the centre of the National Rail network, with 70 per cent of rail journeys starting or ending in London.[295] King's Cross station and Euston station, both in London, are the starting points of the East Coast Main Line and the West Coast Main Line – the two main railway lines in Britain. Like suburban rail services, regional and inter-city trains depart from several termini around the city centre, directly linking London with most of Great Britain's major cities and towns.[296] *The Flying Scotsman* is an express passenger train service that has operated between London and Edinburgh since 1862; the world famous steam locomotive named after this service, *Flying Scotsman*, was the first locomotive to reach the officially authenticated speed of 100 miles per hour (161 km/h) in 1934.[297]\n\n\nSome international railway services to Continental Europe were operated during the 20th century as boat trains. The opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 connected London directly to the continental rail network, allowing Eurostar services to begin. Since 2007, high-speed trains link St. Pancras International with Lille, Calais, Paris, Disneyland Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and other European tourist destinations via the High Speed 1 rail link and the Channel Tunnel.[298] The first high-speed domestic trains started in June 2009 linking Kent to London.[299] There are plans for a second high speed line linking London to the Midlands, North West England, and Yorkshire.[300]\n\n\n\n### Buses, coaches and trams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A New Routemaster (which replaced the AEC Routemaster) entered service in 2012. The red double-decker bus is an emblematic symbol of London.\nLondon's bus network runs 24 hours a day with about 9,300 vehicles, over 675 bus routes and about 19,000 bus stops.[301] In 2019 the network had over 2 billion commuter trips per year.[302] Since 2010 an average of £1.2 billion is taken in revenue each year.[303] London has one of the largest wheelchair-accessible networks in the world[304] and from the third quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced.[305]\n\n\nLondon's coach hub is Victoria Coach Station, opened in 1932. Nationalised in 1970 and subsequently purchased by London Transport which then became Transport for London, Victoria Coach Station has over 14 million passengers a year and provides services across the UK and continental Europe.[306]\n\n\nLondon has a modern tram network, known as Tramlink. It has 39 stops and four routes, and carried 28 million people in 2013.[307] Since June 2008, Transport for London has completely owned and operated Tramlink.[308]\n\n\n\n### Cable car[edit]\n\n\nLondon's first and to date only cable car is the London Cable Car, which opened in June 2012. The cable car crosses the Thames and links Greenwich Peninsula with the Royal Docks in the east of the city. It is able to carry up to 2,500 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times.[309]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cycling in London\n\n![](image)Santander Cycle Hire, near Victoria in Central London\nIn the Greater London Area, around 670,000 people use a bike every day,[310] meaning around 7% of the total population of around 8.8 million use a bike on an average day.[311] Cycling has become an increasingly popular way to get around London. The launch of a bicycle hire scheme in July 2010 was successful and generally well received.[312]\n\n\n\n### Port and river boats[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of London, once the largest in the world, is now only the second-largest in the United Kingdom, handling 45 million tonnes of cargo each year as of 2009.[260] Most of this cargo passes through the Port of Tilbury, outside the boundary of Greater London.[260]\n\n\nLondon has river boat services on the Thames known as Thames Clippers, which offer both commuter and tourist boat services.[313] At major piers including Canary Wharf, London Bridge City, Battersea Power Station and London Eye (Waterloo), services depart at least every 20 minutes during commuter times.[314] The Woolwich Ferry, with 2.5 million passengers every year, is a frequent service linking the North and South Circular Roads.[315]\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nAlthough the majority of journeys in central London are made by public transport, car travel is common in the suburbs. The inner ring road (around the city centre), the North and South Circular roads (just within the suburbs), and the outer orbital motorway (the M25, just outside the built-up area in most places) encircle the city and are intersected by a number of busy radial routes—but very few motorways penetrate into inner London. The M25 is the second-longest ring-road motorway in Europe at 117 miles (188 km) long.[316] The A1 and M1 connect London to Leeds, and Newcastle and Edinburgh.[317]\n\n\n\n![](image)The hackney carriage (black cab) is a common sight on London streets. Although traditionally black, this is not a requirement with some painted in other colours or bearing advertising.\nThe Austin Motor Company began making hackney carriages (London taxis) in 1929, and models include Austin FX3 from 1948, Austin FX4 from 1958, with more recent models TXII and TX4 manufactured by London Taxis International. The BBC states, \"ubiquitous black cabs and red double-decker buses all have long and tangled stories that are deeply embedded in London's traditions\".[318]\n\n\nLondon is notorious for its traffic congestion; in 2009, the average speed of a car in the rush hour was recorded at 10.6 mph (17.1 km/h).[319] In 2003, a congestion charge was introduced to reduce traffic volumes in the city centre. With a few exceptions, motorists are required to pay to drive within a defined zone encompassing much of central London.[320] Motorists who are residents of the defined zone can buy a greatly reduced season pass.[321] Over the course of several years, the average number of cars entering the centre of London on a weekday was reduced from 195,000 to 125,000 cars.[322]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in London\n\n### Tertiary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities and higher education colleges in London\n\n![](image)University College London (UCL), established by Royal Charter in 1836, is one of the founding colleges of the University of London.\n![](image)Imperial College London, a technical research university in South Kensington\nLondon is a major global centre of higher education teaching and research and has the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe.[19] According to the QS World University Rankings 2015/16, London has the greatest concentration of top class universities in the world[323] and its international student population of around 110,000 is larger than any other city in the world.[324] A 2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers report termed London the global capital of higher education.[325]\nA number of world-leading education institutions are based in London. In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, Imperial College London is ranked No. 6 in the world, University College London (UCL) is ranked 8th, and King's College London (KCL) is ranked 37th.[326] All are regularly ranked highly, with Imperial College being the UK's leading university in the Research Excellence Framework ranking 2021.[327] The London School of Economics has been described as the world's leading social science institution for both teaching and research.[328] The London Business School is considered one of the world's leading business schools and in 2015 its MBA programme was ranked second-best in the world by the *Financial Times*.[329] The city is also home to three of the world's top ten performing arts schools (as ranked by the 2020 QS World University Rankings[330]): the Royal College of Music (ranking 2nd in the world), the Royal Academy of Music (ranking 4th) and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (ranking 6th).[331]\n\n\nWith students in London and around 48,000 in University of London Worldwide,[332] the federal University of London is the largest contact teaching university in the UK.[333] It includes five multi-faculty universities – City, King's College London, Queen Mary, Royal Holloway and UCL – and a number of smaller and more specialised institutions including Birkbeck, the Courtauld Institute of Art, Goldsmiths, the London Business School, the London School of Economics, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Royal Academy of Music, the Central School of Speech and Drama, the Royal Veterinary College and the School of Oriental and African Studies.[334]\n\n\nUniversities in London outside the University of London system include Brunel University, Imperial College London,[note 1] Kingston University, London Metropolitan University, University of East London, University of West London, University of Westminster, London South Bank University, Middlesex University, and University of the Arts London (the largest university of art, design, fashion, communication and the performing arts in Europe).[335] In addition, there are three international universities – Regent's University London, Richmond, The American International University in London and Schiller International University.\n\n\nLondon is home to five major medical schools – Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry (part of Queen Mary), King's College London School of Medicine (the largest medical school in Europe), Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School and St George's, University of London – and has many affiliated teaching hospitals. It is also a major centre for biomedical research, and three of the UK's eight academic health science centres are based in the city – Imperial College Healthcare, King's Health Partners and UCL Partners (the largest such centre in Europe).[336] Additionally, many biomedical and biotechnology spin out companies from these research institutions are based around the city, most prominently in White City. Founded by pioneering nurse Florence Nightingale at St Thomas' Hospital in 1860, the first nursing school is now part of King's College London.[337] It was at King's in 1952 where a team led by Rosalind Franklin captured *Photo 51*, the critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.[338] There are a number of business schools in London, including the London School of Business and Finance, Cass Business School (part of City University London), Hult International Business School, ESCP Europe, European Business School London, Imperial College Business School, the London Business School and the UCL School of Management.\n\n\n\n![](image)Opened in 1906, the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama is a member of Conservatoires UK and the Federation of Drama Schools.\nLondon is also home to many specialist arts education institutions, including the Central School of Ballet, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA), London Contemporary Dance School, National Centre for Circus Arts, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA; president Sir Kenneth Branagh), Rambert School of Ballet and Contemporary Dance, the Royal College of Art, Sylvia Young Theatre School and Trinity Laban. The BRIT School in the London borough of Croydon provides training for the performing arts and technologies.[339]\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Centre for School Design\n\nThe majority of primary and secondary schools and further-education colleges in London are controlled by the London boroughs or otherwise state-funded; leading examples include Ashbourne College, Bethnal Green Academy, Brampton Manor Academy, City and Islington College, City of Westminster College, David Game College, Ealing, Hammersmith and West London College, Leyton Sixth Form College, London Academy of Excellence, Tower Hamlets College, and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre. There are also a number of private schools and colleges in London, some old and famous, such as City of London School, Harrow, St Paul's School, Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, University College School, The John Lyon School, Highgate School and Westminster School.\n\n\n\n### Royal Observatory, Greenwich and learned societies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tourists queuing to take pictures on the line of the historic prime meridian at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The observatory has played a major role in the history of navigation and astronomy.\nFounded in 1675, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich was established to address the problem of calculating longitude for navigational purposes. This pioneering work in solving longitude featured in astronomer royal Nevil Maskelyne's *Nautical Almanac* which made the Greenwich meridian the universal reference point, and helped lead to the international adoption of Greenwich as the prime meridian (0° longitude) in 1884.[340]\n\n\nImportant scientific learned societies based in London include the Royal Society—the UK's national academy of sciences and the oldest national scientific institution in the world—founded in 1660,[341] and the Royal Institution, founded in 1799. Since 1825, the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures have presented scientific subjects to a general audience, and speakers have included aerospace engineer Frank Whittle, naturalist David Attenborough and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.[342]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of London\n\n### Leisure and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of annual events in London and West End theatre\n\nLeisure is a major part of the London economy. A 2003 report attributed a quarter of the entire UK leisure economy to London[343] at 25.6 events per 1000 people.[344] The city is one of the four fashion capitals of the world, and, according to official statistics, is the world's third-busiest film production centre, presents more live comedy than any other city,[345] and has the biggest theatre audience of any city in the world.[346]\n\n\n\n![](image)Harrods department store in Knightsbridge\nWithin the City of Westminster in London, the entertainment district of the West End has its focus around Leicester Square, where London and world film premieres are held, and Piccadilly Circus, with its giant electronic advertisements.[347] London's theatre district is here, as are many cinemas, bars, clubs, and restaurants, including the city's Chinatown district (in Soho), and just to the east is Covent Garden, an area housing speciality shops. The city is the home of Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have dominated West End theatre since the late 20th century.[348] Agatha Christie's *The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, has been performed in the West End since 1952.[349] The Laurence Olivier Awards–named after Laurence Olivier–are given annually by the Society of London Theatre. The Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, Royal Opera, and English National Opera are based in London and perform at the Royal Opera House, the London Coliseum, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and the Royal Albert Hall, as well as touring the country.[350]\n\n\nIslington's 1 mile (1.6 km) long Upper Street, extending northwards from Angel, has more bars and restaurants than any other street in the UK.[351] Europe's busiest shopping area is Oxford Street, a shopping street nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) long, making it the longest shopping street in the UK. It is home to vast numbers of retailers and department stores, including Selfridges flagship store.[352] Knightsbridge, home to the equally renowned Harrods department store, lies to the south-west. Opened in 1760 with its flagship store on Regent Street since 1881, Hamleys is the oldest toy store in the world.[353] Madame Tussauds wax museum opened in Baker Street in 1835, an era viewed as being when London's tourism industry began.[354]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scene of the annual Notting Hill Carnival, 2014\nLondon is home to designers John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Manolo Blahnik, and Jimmy Choo, among others; its renowned art and fashion schools make it one of the four international centres of fashion. Mary Quant designed the miniskirt in her King's Road boutique in Swinging Sixties London.[355] London offers a great variety of cuisine as a result of its ethnically diverse population. Gastronomic centres include the Bangladeshi restaurants of Brick Lane and the Chinese restaurants of Chinatown.[356] There are Chinese takeaways throughout London, as are Indian restaurants which provide Indian and Anglo-Indian cuisine.[357] Around 1860, the first fish and chips shop in London was opened by Joseph Malin, a Jewish immigrant, in Bow.[318][358] The full English breakfast dates from the Victorian era, and many cafes in London serve a full English breakfast throughout the day.[359] London has five 3-Michelin star restaurants, including Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in Chelsea.[360] Many hotels in London provide a traditional afternoon tea service, such as the Oscar Wilde Lounge at the Hotel Café Royal in Piccadilly, and a themed tea service is also available, for example an *Alice in Wonderland* themed afternoon tea served at the Egerton House Hotel, and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* themed afternoon tea at One Aldwych in Covent Garden.[361][362] The nation's most popular biscuit to dunk in tea, chocolate digestives have been manufactured by McVitie's at their Harlesden factory in north-west London since 1925.[363]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shakespeare's Globe is a modern reconstruction of the Globe Theatre on the south bank of the Thames.\nThere is a variety of annual events, beginning with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual appointment of a new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along the streets of the city, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.[364] The Boishakhi Mela is a Bengali New Year festival celebrated by the British Bangladeshi community. It is the largest open-air Asian festival in Europe. After the Notting Hill Carnival, it is the second-largest street festival in the United Kingdom attracting over 80,000 visitors.[365] First held in 1862, the RHS Chelsea Flower Show (run by the Royal Horticultural Society) takes place in May every year.[366]\n\n\n\n### LGBT scene[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LGBT culture in London\n\nThe first gay bar in London in the modern sense was The Cave of the Golden Calf, established as a night club in an underground location at 9 Heddon Street, just off Regent Street, in 1912 and \"which developed a reputation for sexual freedom and tolerance of same-sex relations.\"[367]\n\n\n\n![](image)Comptons of Soho during London Pride in 2010\nWhile London has been an LGBT tourism destination, after homosexuality was decriminalised in England in 1967 gay bar culture became more visible, and from the early 1970s Soho (and in particular Old Compton Street) became the centre of the London LGBT community.[368] G-A-Y, previously based at the Astoria, and now Heaven, is a long-running night club.[369]\n\n\nWider British cultural movements have influenced LGBT culture: for example, the emergence of glam rock in the UK in the early 1970s, via Marc Bolan and David Bowie, saw a generation of teenagers begin playing with the idea of androgyny, and the West End musical *The Rocky Horror Show*, which debuted in London in 1973, is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements.[370] The Blitz Kids (which included Boy George) frequented the Tuesday club-night at Blitz in Covent Garden, helping launch the New Romantic subcultural movement in the late 1970s.[371] Today, the annual London Pride Parade and the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival are held in the city.[368]\n\n\n\n### Literature, film and television[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: London in fiction, London in film, List of television shows set in London, and London Television Archive\n\n![](image)Sherlock Holmes Museum in Baker Street, bearing the number 221B\nLondon has been the setting for many works of literature. The pilgrims in Geoffrey Chaucer's late 14th-century *Canterbury Tales* set out for Canterbury from London. William Shakespeare spent a large part of his life living and working in London; his contemporary Ben Jonson was also based there, and some of his work, most notably his play *The Alchemist*, was set in the city.[372] *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722) by Daniel Defoe is a fictionalisation of the events of the 1665 Great Plague.[372]\n\n\nThe literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire; Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has influenced people's vision of early Victorian London; and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century.[372] Later important depictions of London from the 19th and early 20th centuries are Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories.[372] Robert Louis Stevenson mixed in London literary circles, and in 1886 he wrote the *Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde*, a gothic novella set in Victorian London.[373] In 1898, H. G. Wells' sci-fi novel *The War of the Worlds* sees London (and the south of England) invaded by Martians.[374] Letitia Elizabeth Landon wrote *Calendar of the London Seasons* in 1834. Modern writers influenced by the city include Peter Ackroyd, author of a \"biography\" of London, and Iain Sinclair, who writes in the genre of psychogeography. In the 1940s, George Orwell wrote essays in the *London Evening Standard*, most notably \"A Nice Cup of Tea\" (method for making tea) and \"The Moon Under Water\" (an ideal pub).[375] The WWII evacuation of children from London is depicted in C.

The largest cinema chain in the country, Odeon Cinemas was founded in London in 1928 by Oscar Deutsch.[382] The British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs) have been held in London since 1949, with the BAFTA Fellowship the Academy's highest accolade.[383] Founded in 1957, the BFI London Film Festival takes place over two weeks every October.[384]\n\n\nLondon is a major centre for television production, with studios including Television Centre, ITV Studios, Sky Campus and Fountain Studios; the latter hosted the original talent shows, *Pop Idol*, *The X Factor*, and *Britain's Got Talent*, before each format was exported around the world.[385][386] Formerly a franchise of ITV, Thames Television featured comedians such as Benny Hill and Rowan Atkinson (*Mr. Bean* was first screened by Thames), while Talkback produced *Da Ali G Show* which featured Sacha Baron Cohen as Ali G.[387] Many television shows have been set in London, including the popular television soap opera *EastEnders*.[388]\n\n\n\n### Museums, art galleries and libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Albertopolis. The Albert Memorial, Royal Albert Hall, Royal Geographical Society, and Royal College of Art are visible near the top; Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum at the lower end; Imperial College, Royal College of Music, and Science Museum lying in between.\nLondon is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury, in 1753.[389] Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens, and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts from around the globe. In 1824, the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square.[390]\n\n\nThe British Library is the second largest library in the world, and the national library of the United Kingdom.[391] There are many other research libraries, including the Wellcome Library and Dana Centre, as well as university libraries, including the British Library of Political and Economic Science at LSE, the Abdus Salam Library at Imperial, the Maughan Library at King's, and the Senate House Libraries at the University of London.[392]\n\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as \"Albertopolis\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits.[393] The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art. In 2000, this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station which is accessed by pedestrians north of the Thames via the Millennium Bridge.[394]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Royal Albert Hall hosts concerts and musical events, including The Proms which are held every summer, as well as cinema screenings of films accompanied with live orchestral music.\nLondon is one of the major classical and popular music capitals of the world and hosts major music corporations, such as Universal Music Group International and Warner Music Group, and countless bands, musicians and industry professionals. The city is also home to many orchestras and concert halls, such as the Barbican Arts Centre (principal base of the London Symphony Orchestra and the London Symphony Chorus), the Southbank Centre (London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philharmonia Orchestra), Cadogan Hall (Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) and the Royal Albert Hall (The Proms).[350] The Proms, an eight-week summer season of daily orchestral classical music first held in 1895, ends with the Last Night of the Proms. London's two main opera houses are the Royal Opera House and the London Coliseum (home to the English National Opera).[350] The UK's largest pipe organ is at the Royal Albert Hall. Other significant instruments are in cathedrals and major churches—the church bells of St Clement Danes feature in the 1744 nursery rhyme \"Oranges and Lemons\".[395] Several conservatoires are within the city: Royal Academy of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School of Music and Drama and Trinity Laban. The record label EMI was formed in the city in 1931, and an early employee for the company, Alan Blumlein, created stereo sound that year.[396]\n\n\n\n![](image)Abbey Road Studios in Abbey Road\nLondon has numerous venues for rock and pop concerts, including the world's busiest indoor venue, the O2 Arena,[397] and Wembley Arena, as well as many mid-sized venues, such as Brixton Academy, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Shepherd's Bush Empire.[350] Several music festivals, including the Wireless Festival, Lovebox and Hyde Park's British Summer Time, are held in London.[398]\n\n\nThe city is home to the original Hard Rock Cafe and the Abbey Road Studios, where the Beatles recorded many of their hits. In the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, musicians and groups like Elton John, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Queen, Eric Clapton, the Who, Cliff Richard, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Deep Purple, T. Rex, the Police, Elvis Costello, Dire Straits, Cat Stevens, Fleetwood Mac, the Cure, Madness, Culture Club, Dusty Springfield, Phil Collins, Rod Stewart, Status Quo and Sade, derived their sound from the streets and rhythms of London.[399][400]\n\n\nLondon was instrumental in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, the Clash and fashion designer Vivienne Westwood all based in the city.[401][402] Other artists to emerge from the London music scene include George Michael, Kate Bush, Seal, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, the Prodigy, Gorillaz, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Dua Lipa and Florence and the Machine.[403] Artists from London played a prominent role in the development of synth-pop, including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, the Pet Shop Boys and Eurythmics; the latter's \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was recorded in the attic of their north London home, heralding a trend for home recording methods.[404] Artists from London with a Caribbean influence include Hot Chocolate, Billy Ocean, Soul II Soul and Eddy Grant, with the latter fusing reggae, soul and samba with rock and pop.[405] London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of house, hip hop, and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The British Phonographic Industry's annual popular music awards, the Brit Awards, are held in London.[406]\n\n\n\n## Recreation[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and open spaces[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Parks and open spaces in London and Royal Parks of London\n\nSee also: List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London and List of local nature reserves in Greater London\n\n![](image)Hyde Park (with Kensington Gardens in foreground) has been a popular public space since it opened in 1637.\nA 2013 report by the City of London Corporation said that London is the \"greenest city\" in Europe with 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares) of public parks, woodlands and gardens.[407] The largest parks in the central area of London are three of the eight Royal Parks, namely Hyde Park and its neighbour Kensington Gardens in the west, and Regent's Park to the north.[408] Hyde Park in particular is popular for sports and sometimes hosts open-air concerts. Regent's Park contains London Zoo, the world's oldest scientific zoo, and is near Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.[409] Primrose Hill is a popular spot from which to view the city skyline.[410]\n\n\nClose to Hyde Park are smaller Royal Parks, Green Park and St. James's Park.[411] A number of large parks lie outside the city centre, including Hampstead Heath and the remaining Royal Parks of Greenwich Park to the southeast, and Bushy Park and Richmond Park (the largest) to the southwest. Hampton Court Park is also a royal park, but, because it contains a palace, it is administered by the Historic Royal Palaces, unlike the eight Royal Parks.[412]\n\n\nClose to Richmond Park is Kew Gardens, which has the world's largest collection of living plants. In 2003, the gardens were put on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.[413] There are also parks administered by London's borough Councils, including Victoria Park in the East End and Battersea Park in the centre. Some more informal, semi-natural open spaces also exist, including Hampstead Heath and Epping Forest,[414] both controlled by the City of London Corporation.[415] Hampstead Heath incorporates Kenwood House, a former stately home and a popular location in the summer months when classical musical concerts are held by the lake.[416] Epping Forest is a popular venue for various outdoor activities, including mountain biking, walking, horse riding, golf, angling, and orienteering.[414] Three of the UK's most-visited theme parks, Thorpe Park near Staines-upon-Thames, Chessington World of Adventures in Chessington and Legoland Windsor, are located within 20 miles (32 km) of London.[417]\n\n\n\n### Walking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Horse Ride is a tree tunnel (route overhung by trees) on the western side of Wimbledon Common.\nWalking is a popular recreational activity in London. Areas that provide for walks include Wimbledon Common, Epping Forest, Hampton Court Park, Hampstead Heath, the eight Royal Parks, canals and disused railway tracks.[418] Access to canals and rivers has improved recently, including the creation of the Thames Path, some 28 miles (45 km) of which is within Greater London, and The Wandle Trail along the River Wandle.[419]\n\n\nOther long-distance paths, linking green spaces, have also been created, including the Capital Ring, the Green Chain Walk, London Outer Orbital Path (\"Loop\"), Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, and the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Walk.[418]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in London\n\nSee also: Football in London and Rugby union in London\n\n![](image)\nWembley Stadium, home of the England men and women's football team and the FA Cup Final, has a seating capacity of 90,000. It is the UK's biggest stadium.[420]\n![](image)\nCentre Court at Wimbledon. Held every June and July, Wimbledon is the oldest tennis tournament in the world, and the only major played on grass.\n![](image)\nTwickenham, home of the England national rugby union team, has a capacity of 82,000 seats.\n\nLondon has hosted the Summer Olympics three times: in 1908, 1948, and 2012, making it the first city to host the modern Games three times.[34] The city was also the host of the British Empire Games in 1934.[421] In 2017, London hosted the World Championships in Athletics for the first time.[422]\n\n\nLondon's most popular sport is football, and it has seven clubs in the Premier League in the 2022–23 season: Arsenal, Brentford, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, and West Ham United.[423] Other professional men's teams in London are AFC Wimbledon, Barnet, Bromley, Charlton Athletic, Dagenham & Redbridge, Leyton Orient, Millwall, Queens Park Rangers and Sutton United. Four London-based teams are in the Women's Super League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and West Ham United.\n\n\nTwo Premiership Rugby union teams are based in Greater London: Harlequins and Saracens.[424] Ealing Trailfinders and London Scottish play in the RFU Championship; other rugby union clubs in the city include Richmond, Rosslyn Park, Westcombe Park and Blackheath. Twickenham Stadium in south-west London hosts home matches for the England national rugby union team.[425] While rugby league is more popular in the north of England, the sport has one professional club in London – the London Broncos who play in the Super League.\n\n\nOne of London's best-known annual sports competitions is the Wimbledon Tennis Championships, held at the All England Club in the south-western suburb of Wimbledon since 1877.[426] Played in late June to early July, it is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and widely considered the most prestigious.[427][428]\n\n\nLondon has two Test cricket grounds which host the England cricket team, Lord's (home of Middlesex C.C.C.) and the Oval (home of Surrey C.C.C.). Lord's has hosted four finals of the Cricket World Cup and is known as the *Home of Cricket*.[429] In golf, the Wentworth Club is located in Virginia Water, Surrey on the south-west fringes of London, while the closest venue to London that is used as one of the courses for the Open Championship, the oldest major and tournament in golf, is Royal St George's in Sandwich, Kent.[430] Alexandra Palace in north London hosts the PDC World Darts Championship and the Masters snooker tournament. Other key annual events are the mass-participation London Marathon[431] and the University Boat Race.[432]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from London\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)London portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)England portal\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* Outline of England\n* Outline of London\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** London region (Greater London administrative area)\n\n1. **^** Imperial College London was a constituent college of the University of London between 1908 and 2007.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the second international airport in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.[15][16]\n\n\nCombining both modern and traditional style architectures, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[20] Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites—the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal—all of which are popular tourist locations.[21] Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\n\n\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.[22][23][24] Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in Asia & Oceania region and emerging countries.[25][26] Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][28] The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics,[29] and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics.[30] Beijing hosts 175 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Beijing\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 *běi* for *north* and 京 *jīng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is 京, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Beijing\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. *Homo erectus* fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic *Homo sapiens* also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[34] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\n\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City, built by the Yongle Emperor during the early Ming dynasty\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground.[42] Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (Wade–Giles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\").[43] Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\n\n![](image)Overlapping layout of Beijing during the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\n\n\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[47] It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[48] The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.[49]\n\n\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area.\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers)[50] and Beijing became China's sole capital.[51] The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\n\n\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking[a] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion. \nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers.[54] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.[55]\n\n\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.[56] The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war,[12] Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[59] and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.[60] This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing.[61]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.[63] In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up.\"\n\n\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads.[64][65] According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.[66] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,[67] while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China.[68] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country.[69] Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[70] The city has also hosted major international events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Beijing\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by *Xishan* or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556 ft).\n\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South–North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\n\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres (130–200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east–west axis.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of the Forbidden City, viewed from the Jingshan Park\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North-South Central Axis of Beijing City\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Beijing\n\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.[72] Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wangjing SOHO\nBeijing is famous for its *siheyuans*, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called *hutongs*. The *hutongs* are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, *siheyuans* and *hutongs* are rapidly disappearing,[73] as entire city blocks of *hutongs* are replaced by high-rise buildings.[74] Residents of the *hutongs* are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the *hutongs* cannot be replaced,[75] and these properties are often government owned.[76]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing average annual temperatures from 1970 to 2019 during summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January, and February). Weather station data from NOAA. For comparison the Global Surface Temperature Anomaly rose by approximately one degree over the same time period. Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dwa*), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: *BSk*) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cwa*), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[77] Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is −3.5 °C (25.7 °F), while in July it is 26.8 °C (80.2 °F). Precipitation averages around 577 mm (23 in) annually, with close to three-quarters of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,455 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −27.4 °C (−17.3 °F) on 22 February 1966 to 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) was set on 15 June 1942).[78][79]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | −1.0(30.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | −5.0(23.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.8(−9.0)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n | −15(5)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −18.3(−0.9)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 5.8(0.23)\n | 8.6(0.34)\n | 21.7(0.85)\n | 36.1(1.42)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 169.7(6.68)\n | 113.4(4.46)\n | 53.7(2.11)\n | 28.7(1.13)\n | 13.5(0.53)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 528(20.78)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 1.6\n | 2.3\n | 3.0\n | 4.7\n | 6.0\n | 10.0\n | 11.9\n | 10.5\n | 7.1\n | 5.2\n | 2.9\n | 1.6\n | 66.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 2.8\n | 2.5\n | 1.3\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.7\n | 2.8\n | 11.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 43\n | 42\n | 40\n | 43\n | 47\n | 58\n | 69\n | 71\n | 64\n | 58\n | 54\n | 46\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 188.1\n | 189.1\n | 231.1\n | 243.2\n | 265.1\n | 221.6\n | 190.5\n | 205.3\n | 206.1\n | 199.9\n | 173.4\n | 177.1\n | 2,490.5\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62\n | 62\n | 62\n | 61\n | 59\n | 50\n | 42\n | 49\n | 56\n | 59\n | 59\n | 61\n | 57\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: China Meteorological Administration[80][81] |\n| Source 2: Extremes[b] and Weather Atlas[85] |\n\n#### Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When Europeans first came into sustained contact with China, \"Pekin\" and \"Peking\" were the most popular ways of romanizing the name of Beijing.[52][53]\n2. **^** All-time record high;[79] February record high;[82] May record high;[83] June record high[84]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased.[87] Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\",[89] partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent.[90] Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations,[91] and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers),[92] reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles.[93][94] The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world.[90] Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.[95]\n\n\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.[96] Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas[97] and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry.[97] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions.[96] Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015.[98] Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making.[99] Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing.[96] Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption.[98] There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014.[100] Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016.[101] Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.[101]\n\n\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area.[102] More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue,\" short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively.[103] During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\n\n\nBeijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of the city's US embassy at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the WHO, and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was \"crazy bad\". This was later changed to \"beyond index\".[104]\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.[105] Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.[106]\n\n\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.[107]\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017[108] and further reduction by 2020.[109]: 52\n\n\n\n### Readings[edit]\n\n\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).[110] The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone levels on Twitter.[111] Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.[111]\n\n\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the mobility rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing.[112] Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.[113]\n\n\n\n#### Dust storms[edit]\n\n\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.[114] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.[115] In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.[116]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Beijing\n\nThe municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Beijing CCP Secretary (Chinese: 中共北京市委书记). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\n\n\nGovernment officials include the mayor (Chinese: 市长) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[117]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township-level divisions of Beijing.\n\nBeijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county-level subdivisions including 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. On 1 July 2010, Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively. On 13 November 2015 Miyun and Yanqing were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Beijing** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Dongcheng**\n\n**Xicheng**\n\n**Chaoyang**\n\n**Fengtai**\n\n**Shijingshan**\n\n**Haidian**\n\n**Mentougou**\n\n**Fangshan**\n\n**Tongzhou**\n\n**Shunyi**\n\n**Changping**\n\n**Daxing**\n\n**Huairou**\n\n**Pinggu**\n\n**Miyun**\n\n**Yanqing**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area in km2[119] | Total population 2010[120] | Urban areapopulation 2010[121] | Seat\n | Postal code\n | Subdivisions[122][*full citation needed*] |\n| Subdistricts | Towns | Townships[n 1] | Residential communities | Villages |\n| 110000 | Beijing\n | 16406.16 | 19,612,368 | 16,858,692 | Dongcheng / Tongzhou | 100000 | 149 | 143 | 38 | 2538 | 3857\n |\n| 110101 | Dongcheng | 41.82 | 919,253 | Jingshan Subdistrict | 100000 | 17 |  |  | 216 |  |\n| 110102 | Xicheng | 50.33 | 1,243,315 | Jinrong Street Subdistrict | 100000 | 15 |  |  | 259 |  |\n| 110105 | Chaoyang | 454.78 | 3,545,137 | 3,532,257 | Chaowai Subdistrict | 100000 | 24 |  | 19 | 358 | 5\n |\n| 110106 | Fengtai | 305.53 | 2,112,162 | 2,098,632 | Fengtai Subdistrict | 100000 | 16 | 2 | 3 | 254 | 73\n |\n| 110107 | Shijingshan | 84.38 | 616,083 | Lugu Subdistrict | 100000 | 9 |  |  | 130 |  |\n| 110108 | Haidian | 430.77 | 3,280,670 | 3,208,563 | Haidian Subdistrict | 100000 | 22 | 7 |  | 603 | 84\n |\n| 110109 | Mentougou | 1447.85 | 290,476 | 248,547 | Dayu Subdistrict | 102300 | 4 | 9 |  | 124 | 179\n |\n| 110111 | Fangshan | 1994.73 | 944,832 | 635,282 | Gongchen Subdistrict | 102400 | 8 | 14 | 6 | 108 | 462\n |\n| 110112 | Tongzhou | 905.79 | 1,184,256 | 724,228 | Beiyuan Subdistrict | 101100 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 40 | 480\n |\n| 110113 | Shunyi | 1019.51 | 876,620 | 471,459 | Shengli Subdistrict | 101300 | 6 | 19 |  | 61 | 449\n |\n| 110114 | Changping | 1342.47 | 1,660,501 | 1,310,617 | Chengbei Subdistrict | 102200 | 8 | 14 |  | 180 | 303\n |\n| 110115 | Daxing | 1036.34 | 1,365,112 | 965,683 | Xingfeng Subdistrict | 102600 | 5 | 14 |  | 64 | 547\n |\n| 110116 | Huairou | 2122.82 | 372,887 | 253,088 | Longshan Subdistrict | 101400 | 2 | 12 | 2 | 27 | 286\n |\n| 110117 | Pinggu | 948.24 | 415,958 | 219,850 | Binhe Subdistrict | 101200 | 2 | 14 | 2 | 23 | 275\n |\n| 110118 | Miyun | 2225.92 | 467,680 | 257,449 | Gulou Subdistrict | 101500 | 2 | 17 | 1 | 57 | 338\n |\n| 110119 | Yanqing | 1994.89 | 317,426 | 154,386 | Rulin Subdistrict | 102100 | 3 | 11 | 4 | 34 | 376\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n |\n| Beijing Municipality\n | 北京市 | Běijīng Shì\n |\n| Dongcheng District | 东城区 | Dōngchéng Qū\n |\n| Xicheng District | 西城区 | Xīchéng Qū\n |\n| Chaoyang District | 朝阳区 | Cháoyáng Qū\n |\n| Fengtai District | 丰台区 | Fēngtái Qū\n |\n| Shijingshan District | 石景山区 | Shíjǐngshān Qū\n |\n| Haidian District | 海淀区 | Hǎidiàn Qū\n |\n| Mentougou District | 门头沟区 | Méntóugōu Qū\n |\n| Fangshan District | 房山区 | Fángshān Qū\n |\n| Tongzhou District | 通州区 | Tōngzhōu Qū\n |\n| Shunyi District | 顺义区 | Shùnyì Qū\n |\n| Changping District | 昌平区 | Chāngpíng Qū\n |\n| Daxing District | 大兴区 | Dàxīng Qū\n |\n| Huairou District | 怀柔区 | Huáiróu Qū\n |\n| Pinggu District | 平谷区 | Pínggǔ Qū\n |\n| Miyun District | 密云区 | Mìyún Qū\n |\n| Yanqing District | 延庆区 | Yánqìng Qū\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Including Ethnic townships & other township related subdivisions.\n\n#### Towns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of township-level divisions of Beijing\n\nBeijing's 16 county-level divisions (districts) are further subdivided into 273 lower third-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24 townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.\nTowns within Beijing Municipality but outside the urban area include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n* Changping 昌平\n* Huairou 怀柔\n* Miyun 密云\n* Liangxiang 良乡\n* Liulimiao 琉璃庙\n* Tongzhou 通州\n* Yizhuang 亦庄\n* Tiantongyuan 天通苑\n* Beiyuan 北苑\n* Xiaotangshan 小汤山\n\nSeveral place names in Beijing end with *mén* (门), meaning \"gate\", as they were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names end in *cūn* (村), meaning \"village\", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and procuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe judicial system in Beijing consists of the Supreme People's Court, the highest court in the country, the Beijing Municipal High People's Court, the high people's court of the municipality, three intermediate people's courts, one intermediate railway transport court, 14 basic people's court (one for each of the municipality's districts and counties), and one basic railway transport court. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shijingshan oversees the basic courts of Haidian, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changping and Yanqing.[123] The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Fengtai oversees the basic courts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Fangshan and Daxing.[123] The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Laiguangying, is the newest of the three intermediate people's courts and opened on 21 August 2013.[123] It oversees the district courts of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun.[123][124] Each court in Beijing has a corresponding people's procuratorate.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing products treemap, 2020\nAs of 2022[update], Beijing's nominal GDP was CN¥4.16 trillion ($619 billion in nominal, $1.016 trillion in PPP), about 3.44% of the country's GDP and ranked 13th among province-level administrative units; its nominal GDP per capita was US$28,258 (CN¥190,059) and ranked the 1st in the country.[3][125] It also ranks the tenth largest in the metropolitan economies in the world.[126] Beijing's nominal GDP is projected to reach US$1.1 trillion in 2035, ranking among the world's top 10 largest cities (together with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[127] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach US$45,000 in 2030.[128]\n\n\nDue to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world.[129] As of August 2022, Beijing has 54 Fortune Global 500 companies, more than Japan (47), the third-place country after China (145) and the United States (124).[130][131] Beijing has also been described as the \"billionaire capital of the world\".[132][133] In 2020, Beijing is the fifth wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $2 trillion.[134] Beijing is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and worldwide and making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[135] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Beijing was ranked as having the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world and fourth-most competitive in the whole Asia & Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore).[136]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020–2021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical GDP of Beijing for 1978–present (SNA2008)[138]

GDP is based on mid-year population.\n\n\n\n### Sector composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Taikoo Li Sanlitun shopping arcade is a destination for locals and visitors.\nThe city has a post-industrial economy that is dominated by the tertiary sector (services), which generated 83.8% of output, followed by the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) at 15.8% and the primary sector (agriculture, mining) at 0.26%.[3] The services sector is broadly diversified with professional services, wholesale and retail, information technology, commercial real estate, scientific research, and residential real estate each contributing at least 6% to the city's economy in 2022.[3][140]\n\n\nThe single largest sub-sector remains industry, whose share of overall output has shrunk to 12.1% in 2022.[3] The mix of industrial output has changed significantly since 2010 when the city announced that 140 highly-polluting, energy and water resource intensive enterprises would be relocated from the city in five years.[141] The relocation of Capital Steel to neighboring Hebei province had begun in 2005.[142][143] In 2013, output of automobiles, aerospace products, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and food processing all increased.[140]\n\n\nIn the farmland around Beijing, vegetables and fruits have displaced grain as the primary crops under cultivation.[140] In 2013, the tonnage of vegetable, edible fungus and fruit harvested was over three times that of grain.[140] In 2013, overall acreage under cultivation shrank along with most categories of produce as more land was reforested for environmental reasons.[140]\n\n\n\n### Economic zones[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of economic and technological development zones in Beijing.\n\n![](image)The skyline of Beijing CBD\n![](image)Zhongguancun is a technology hub in Haidian District.\nIn 2006, the city government identified six high-end economic output zones around Beijing as the primary engines for local economic growth. In 2012, the six zones produced 43.3% of the city's GDP, up from 36.5% in 2007.[144][145]\nThe six zones are:\n\n\n\n1. Zhongguancun, China's silicon village in Haidian District northwest of the city, is home to both established and start-up tech companies. In the first two quarters of 2014, 9,895 companies registered in the six zones, among which 6,150 were based in Zhongguancun.[146] Zhongguancun is also the center of Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.\n2. Beijing Financial Street, in Xicheng District on the west side of the city between Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen, is lined with headquarters of large state banks and insurance companies. The country's financial regulatory agencies including the central bank, bank regulator, securities regulator, and foreign exchange authority are located in the neighborhood.\n3. Beijing Central Business District (CBD), is actually located to the east of downtown, near the embassies along the eastern Third Ring Road between Jianguomenwai and Chaoyangmenwai. The CBD is home to most of the city's skyscraper office buildings. Most of the city's foreign companies and professional service firms are based in the CBD.\n4. Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area, better known as Yizhuang, is an industrial park the straddles the southern Fifth Ring Road in Daxing District. It has attracted pharmaceutical, information technology, and materials engineering companies.[147]\n5. Beijing Airport Economic Zone was created in 1993 and surrounds the Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi District northeast of the city. In addition to logistics, airline services, and trading firms, this zone is also home to Beijing's automobile assembly plants.\n6. Beijing Olympic Center Zone surrounds the Olympic Green due north of downtown and is developing into an entertainment, sports, tourism and business convention center.\n\n\nShijingshan, on the western outskirts of the city, is a traditional heavy industrial base for steel-making.[148] Chemical plants are concentrated in the far eastern suburbs.\n\n\nLess legitimate enterprises also exist. Urban Beijing is known for being a center of infringed goods; anything from the latest designer clothing to DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Beijing\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953 | 2,768,149 | —     |\n| 1964 | 7,568,495 | +9.57% |\n| 1982 | 9,230,687 | +1.11% |\n| 1990 | 10,819,407 | +2.00% |\n| 2000 | 13,569,194 | +2.29% |\n| 2010 | 19,612,368 | +3.75% |\n| 2020[138] | 21,893,095 | +1.11% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2021, Beijing had a total population of 21.89 million within the municipality, of which 19.16 million (87.5 percent) resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.73 million (12.5) lived in rural villages.[3] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 24.9 million.[150][151]\n\n\nWithin China, the city ranked second in urban population after Shanghai and the third in municipal population after Shanghai and Chongqing. Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years, especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was the largest city in the world.\n\n\nAbout 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local *hukou* permits, which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.[140] The remaining 8 million residents had *hukou* permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.[140]\n\n\nThe population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.[140] The total population in 2004 was 14.213 million.[152] The population gains are driven largely by migration. The population's rate of natural increase in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a birth rate of 8.93 and a mortality rate of 4.52.[140] The gender balance was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.[140]\n\n\nWorking age people account for nearly 73.6% of the population.[3] Compared to 2004, residents age 0–14 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.95% to 9.92% in 2013, but again increased to 12.1% in 2021.[3]\nResidents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 8.58%, but increased to 14.2% in 2021.[3] From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of city residents with at least some college education nearly doubled, from 20.4% to 37.3%, and further increased to 49.1% by 2021.[3] About 66.4% have senior secondary school education and 88.2% had reached middle school.[3]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, nearly 96% of Beijing's population are ethnic Han Chinese.[153] Of the 800,000 ethnic minority population living in the capital, Manchu (336,000), Hui (249,000), Korean (77,000), Mongol (37,000) and Tujia (24,000) constitute the five largest groups.[154] In addition, there were 8,045 Hong Kong residents, 500 Macau residents, and 7,772 Taiwan residents along with 91,128 registered foreigners living in Beijing.[153] A study by the Beijing Academy of Sciences estimates that in 2010 there were on average 200,000 foreigners living in Beijing on any given day including students, business travellers and tourists that are not counted as registered residents.[155]\n\n\nIn 2017 the Chinese government implemented population controls for Beijing and Shanghai to fight what it called the \"big city disease\" which includes congestion, pollution, and shortages of education and health care services. From this policy, Beijing's population declined by 20,000 from 2016 to 2017.[156] Some low-income people are being forcibly removed from the city as both legal and illegal housing is being demolished in some high-density residential neighborhoods.[156] The population is being redistributed to Jing-Jin-Ji and Xiong'an New Area, the transfer to the latter expected to include 300,000-500,000 people working in government research, universities, and corporate headquarters.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Beijing, Education in China, and Higher education in China\n\nSee also: Rankings of universities in China, List of universities in China, and Double First Class University Plan\nBeijing is a world leading center for scientific and technological innovation and has been ranked the No.1 city in the world with the largest scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][159][28] The city is also leading the world with the highest share of articles published in the fields of physical sciences, chemistry, and earth and environmental sciences, especially in the United Nations'17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related output.[160][161][162][163]\n\n\nBeijing has over 90 public colleges and universities, which is the largest urban public university system in Asia and the first city in China with most higher education institutions,[164][165] and it is home to the two best universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the whole of Asia-Oceania region and emerging countries with its shared rankings at 16th place in the world by the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[166][167][26] Both are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[168]\n\n\nBeijing also has the highest number of universities of any city in the country, representing more than one-fifth of 147 Double First-Class Universities, a national plan to develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions by the end of 2050.[169] A number of Beijing's most prestigious universities consistently rank among the best in the

universities\" or \"211 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[173][174]\n\n\nThe city is a seat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been consistently ranked the No.1 research institute in the world by *Nature Index* since the list's inception in 2014, by Nature Research.[175][176][177] The academy also runs the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in Beijing and ranked among the world's top five research institutions by the Nature Index.[178] Beijing is also a site of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\nSome of the national key universities in Beijing are:\n\n* Beijing Forestry University\n* Beijing Jiaotong

Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[179]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Beijing Ancient Observatory\nPeople native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. This speech is the basis for *putonghua*, the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.\n\n\nBeijing or Peking opera is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sliced Peking duck served with traditional condiments\nBeijing cuisine is the local style of cooking. Peking duck is perhaps the best known dish. Fuling jiabing, a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (*bing*) resembling a flat disk with a filling made from *fu ling*, a fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing.\n\n\nThe cloisonné (or *Jingtailan*, literally \"Blue of Jingtai\") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.[181] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include \"carved lacquer\" and \"engraved gold\".\n\n\nYounger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.[182] Today, Houhai, Sanlitun and Wudaokou are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.\n\n\nIn 2012 Beijing was named as City of Design and became part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[183]\n\n\n\n### Places of interest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Beijing) and List of Beijing landmarks\n\n\n> ...the city remains an epicenter of tradition with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view—in the famed Forbidden City and in the city's lush pavilions and gardens...\n> \n> — National Geographic[184]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Qianmen Avenue, a traditional commercial street outside Qianmen Gate along the southern Central Axis\n![](image)Inside the Forbidden City\nAt the historical heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;[185] the Forbidden City hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably Beihai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places, particularly Beihai Park, are described as masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,[186] and are tourist destinations of historical importance;[187] in the modern era, Zhongnanhai has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. From Tiananmen Square, right across from the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the city; the former, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[188] contains a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that served as the summer retreats for the Qing imperial family.\n\n\nAmong the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (*Tiantan*), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[189] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayers to Heaven for good harvest. In the north of the city is the Temple of Earth (*Ditan*), while the Temple of the Sun (*Ritan*) and the Temple of the Moon (*Yuetan*) lie in the eastern and western urban areas respectively. Other well-known temple sites include the Dongyue Temple, Tanzhe Temple, Miaoying Temple, White Cloud Temple, Yonghe Temple, Fayuan Temple, Wanshou Temple and Big Bell Temple. The city also has its own Confucius Temple, and a Guozijian or Imperial Academy. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, built in 1605, is the oldest Catholic church in Beijing. The Niujie Mosque is the oldest mosque in Beijing, with a history stretching back over a thousand years.\n\n\n\n![](image)Universal Studios Beijing\n![](image)Happy Valley Beijing\nBeijing contains several well-preserved pagodas and stone pagodas, such as the towering Pagoda of Tianning Temple, which was built during the Liao dynasty from 1100 to 1120, and the Pagoda of Cishou Temple, which was built in 1576 during the Ming dynasty. Historically noteworthy stone bridges include the 12th-century Lugou Bridge, the 17th-century Baliqiao bridge, and the 18th-century Jade Belt Bridge. The Beijing Ancient Observatory displays pre-telescopic spheres dating back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Fragrant Hills (*Xiangshan*) is a public park that consists of natural landscaped areas as well as traditional and cultural relics. The Beijing Botanical Garden exhibits over 6,000 species of plants, including a variety of trees, bushes and flowers, and an extensive peony garden. The Taoranting, Longtan, Chaoyang, Haidian, Milu Yuan and Zizhu Yuan parks are some of the notable recreational parks in the city. The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the Chinese giant panda.\n\n\nThere are 144 museums and galleries (as of June 2008[update]) in the city.[190][191][192] In addition to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.[192]\n\n\nLocated at the outskirts of urban Beijing, but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[193] The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the municipality,[194] containing a wealth of discoveries, among them one of the first specimens of *Homo erectus* and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena *Pachycrocuta brevirostris*. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China,[195] most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Beijing is the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[196] Theme parks located within the city include Universal Studios Beijing and Happy Valley Beijing, both of which are among the most visited theme parks in Asia.[197]\n\n\n\n### Intangible cultural heritage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peking opera\nThe cultural heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse. Starting 2006, the Beijing government started the process of selecting and preserving cultural heritages. Five cultural heritage lists have been published over the years. 288 distinct practices are categorized as cultural heritage. These 288 cultural heritages are further divided into ten categories, namely folk music, folk dance, traditional opera, melodious art, juggling and game, folk art, traditional handicraft, traditional medicine, folk literature and folklore.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n* Folk music\n\t+ Zhihua Temple music\n\t+ Tongzhou shanty\n* Folk dance\n\t+ Tongzhou Dragon dance\n\t+ Miliangtun Stilts\n* Traditional opera\n\t+ Kunqu\n\t+ Peking opera\n* Melodious art\n\t+ Xiangsheng\n* Acrobatic Performance and game\n\t+ Weiqi(Go)\n\t+ Xiangqi\n* Folk art\n\t+ Ivory carving\n* Traditional handicraft\n\t+ Peking duck manufacturing techniques\n\t+ Cloisonné manufacturing techniques\n* Traditional medicine\n\t+ Tong Ren Tang culture\n* Folk literature\n\t+ Yongding River legend[*permanent dead link*]\n* Folklore\n\t+ Miaohui\n\t+ Lantern Festival\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThe religious heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse as Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity all have significant historical presence in the city. As the national capital, the city also hosts the State Administration for Religious Affairs and various state-sponsored institutions of the leading religions.[202] In recent decades, foreign residents have brought other religions to the city.[202] According to Wang Zhiyun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2010 there were 2.2 million Buddhists in the city, equal to 11.2% of the total population.[203] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.78% of the city's population.[204] According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 1.76% of the population of Beijing.[205]\n\n\n\n### Chinese folk religion and Taoism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fire God Temple in Di'anmen\nBeijing has many temples dedicated to folk religious and communal deities, many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the God of Heaven (祭天; *jìtiān*) at the Temple of Heaven have been resumed by Confucian groups in the 2010s.\n\n\nThere are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (娘娘; *Niángniáng*) in the city, one of them near the Olympic Village, and they revolve around a major cult center at Mount Miaofeng. There are also many temples consecrated to the Dragon God, to the Medicine Master (药王; *Yàowáng*), to Divus Guan (Guan Yu), to the Fire God (火神; *Huǒshén*), to the Wealth God, temples of the City God, and at least one temple consecrated to the Yellow Deity of the Chariot Shaft (轩辕黄帝; *Xuānyuán Huángdì*) in Pinggu District. Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake, while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the tallest in the world.[206][207]\n\n\nThe national Chinese Taoist Association and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the White Cloud Temple of Quanzhen Taoism, which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times. The Beijing Dongyue Temple outside Chaoyangmen is the largest temple of Zhengyi Taoism in the city. The local Beijing Taoist Association has its headquarters at the Lüzu Temple near Fuxingmen.[208]\n\n\n\n### Buddhism[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The Buddhist Association of China, the state's supervisory organ overseeing all Buddhist institutions in mainland China, is headquartered in the Guangji Temple, a temple founded over 800 years ago during the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in what is now Fuchengmennei (阜成门内). The Beijing Buddhist Association along with the Buddhist Choir and Orchestra are based in the Guanghua Temple, which dates to the Yuan dynasty over 700 years ago. The Buddhist Academy of China and its library are housed in the Fayuan Temple near Caishikou. The Fayuan Temple, which dates to the Tang dynasty 1300 years ago, is the oldest temple in urban Beijing. The Tongjiao Temple inside Dongzhimen is the city's only Buddhist nunnery.\n\n\nThe Xihuang Temple originally dates to the Liao dynasty. In 1651, the temple was commissioned by the Qing Emperor Shunzhi to host the visit of the Fifth Dalai Lama to Beijing. Since then, this temple has hosted the 13th Dalai Lama as well as the Sixth, Ninth and Tenth Panchen Lamas.\n\n\nThe largest Tibetan Buddhist Temple in Beijing is the Yonghe Temple, which was decreed by the Qing Emperor Qianlong in 1744 to serve as the residence and research facility for his Buddhist preceptor of Rölpé Dorjé the third Changkya (or living Buddha of Inner Mongolia). The Yonghe Temple is so-named because it was the childhood residence of the Yongzheng Emperor, and retains the glazed tiles reserved for imperial palaces. While the \"High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China\", China's highest institution college of Tibetan Buddhism, situated near the Yonghe Temple. The Lingguang Temple of Badachu in the Western Hills also dates to the Tang dynasty. The temple's Zhaoxian Pagoda (招仙塔) was first built in 1071 during the Liao dynasty to hold a tooth relic of the Buddha. The pagoda was destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and the tooth was discovered from its foundation. A new pagoda was built in 1964. The six aforementioned temples: Guangji, Guanghua, Tongjiao, Xihuang, Yonghe and Lingguang have been designated National Key Buddhist Temples in Han Chinese Area.\n\n\nIn addition, other notable temples in Beijing include the Tanzhe Temple (founded in the Jin dynasty (266–420) is the oldest in the municipality), the Tianning Temple (oldest pagoda in the city), the Miaoying Temple (famed for Yuan-era white pagoda), the Wanshou Temple (home to the Beijing Art Museum) and the Big Bell Temple (Dazhong Temple).\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Niujie Mosque\nBeijing has about 70 mosques recognized by the Islamic Association of China, whose headquarters are located next to the Niujie Mosque, the oldest mosque in the city.[209][210] The Niujie Mosque was founded in 996 during the Liao dynasty and is frequently visited by Muslim dignitaries. The Chinese Muslim community reportedly celebrated Ramadan and made Eid prayers at the mosque on 2021.[211][212]\n\n\nThe largest mosque[213] in Beijing is ChangYing mosque, located in ChaoYang district, with an area of 8,400 square meters.\n\n\nOther notable mosques in the old city include the Dongsi Mosque, founded in 1346; the Huashi Mosque, founded in 1415; Nan Douya Mosque, near Chaoyangmen; Jinshifang Street Mosque, in Xicheng District; and the Dongzhimen Mosque.[214] There are large mosques in outlying Muslim communities in Haidian, Madian, Tongzhou, Changping, Changying, Shijingshan and Miyun. The China Islamic Institute is located in the Niujie neighborhood in Xicheng District.\n\n\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Church of the Saviour, also known as the Xishiku Church, built in 1703\n#### Catholicism[edit]\n\n\nIn 1289, John of Montecorvino came to Beijing as a Franciscan missionary with the order from the Pope. After meeting and receiving the support of Kublai Khan in 1293, he built the first Catholic church in Beijing in 1305. The Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association (CPCA), based in Houhai is the government oversight body for Catholics in mainland China. Notable Catholic churches in Beijing include:\n\n\n\n* the Nantang or Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception also known as the Xuanwumen Church, which was founded in 1605 and whose current archbishop, Joseph Li Shan, is one of the few bishops in China to have the support of both the Vatican and the CPCA.\n* the Dongtang or St. Joseph's Church, better known as the Wangfujing Church, founded in 1653.\n* the Beitang or Church of the Saviour, also known as the Xishiku Church, founded in 1703.\n* the Xitang or Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel also known as the Xizhimen Church, founded in 1723.\n\n\nThe National Seminary of Catholic Church in China is located in Daxing District.\n\n\n\n#### Protestantism[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest Protestant churches in Beijing were founded by British and American missionaries in the second half of the 19th century. Protestant missionaries also opened schools, universities and hospitals which have become important civic institutions. Most of Beijing's Protestant churches were destroyed during the Boxer Rebellion and afterwards rebuilt. In 1958, the 64 Protestant churches in the city are reorganized into four and overseen by the state through the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.\n\n\n\n#### Eastern Orthodox[edit]\n\n\nThere was a significant amount of Orthodox Christians in Beijing. Orthodoxy came to Beijing with Russian prisoners from the Sino-Russian border conflicts of the 17th century.[215] In 1956, Viktor, the bishop of Beijing returned to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet embassy took over the old cathedral and demolished it. In 2007, the Russian embassy built a new church in its garden to serve the Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n#### Television and radio[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The China Central Television Headquarters building in CBD\nBeijing Television broadcasts on channels 1 through 10, and China Central Television, China's largest television network, maintains its headquarters in Beijing.

Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: Shanghai (Jinghu Line), Guangzhou (Jingguang Line), Kowloon (Jingjiu Line), Harbin (Jingha Line) (including Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)), Baotou (Jingbao Line), Chengde (Jingcheng Line), Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line), Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line) and Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line). In addition, the Datong–Qinhuangdao railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\n\nBeijing also has six high-speed rail lines: the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway, which opened in 2008; the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011; the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, which opened in 2012; and the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway and the Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway, both of which opened in 2019. The Beijing–Shenyang high-speed railway was completed in 2021.\n\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the Beijing railway station, which opened in 1959; the Beijing West railway station, which opened in 1996; and the Beijing South railway station, which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The Beijing North railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The Qinghe railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The Beijing Chaoyang railway station opened in 2021; The Beijing Fengtai railway station opened in 2022; and the Beijing Sub-Center railway station is under construction.\n\n\nSmaller stations in the city including Beijing East railway station and Daxing Airport station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.[222]\n\n\nFrom Beijing, direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam and North Korea. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing\n\n![](image)View of 4th Ring Road in Chaoyang District\n![](image)Traffic jam on the Beijing–Tongzhou Expressway\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the \"ring roads\" that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Beijing–Lhasa Expressway in Changping District\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.[223] The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles.[224] By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.[225]\n\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.[226] More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\n\n\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.[227]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n#### Beijing Capital International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terminal 3 of the Beijing Capital International Airport\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20 mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport.[14] Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Beijing Daxing International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Daxing International Airport\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29 mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019.[228][229][230] The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.\n\n\n\n#### Other airports[edit]\n\n\nWith the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n\n#### Visa requirements for air passengers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 1 January 2013[update], tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers[231] with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.[232]\n\n\n\n### Public transit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Daxing line train on the Beijing Subway, which is among the longest and busiest rapid transit systems in the world\n![](image)An articulated Beijing bus\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783 km (487 mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of ¥2.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes.[233][*better source needed*] The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\n\n\nOn 28 December 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express.[234] Under the new system a trip under 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) will cost ¥3.00(US$0.49), an additional ¥1.00 will be added for the next 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) and the next 10 km (6 mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32 km (20 mi).[234] For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional ¥1.00 is added.[234] For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost ¥ 8.00.\n\n\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as ¥1.00 when purchased with the *Yikatong* metrocard.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at ¥13 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9 mi), ¥2.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) and ¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are ¥2.3 (¥4.6 during rush hours of 7–9 am and 5–7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5 mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, Citroëns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion *over* that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11 pm and 5 am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15 km (9 mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.[235] On 30 March 2019, a 6.5 km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies.[236] Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.[237]\n\n\n\n## Defence and aerospace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\n\n\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\n\n\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, in Haidian District tracks the country's crewed and uncrewed flight and other space exploration initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Nature and wildlife[edit]\n\n\nBeijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7 km2 (517.3 sq mi).[238] The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard, leopard cat, wolf, red fox, wild boar, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, hog badger, Siberian weasel, Amur hedgehog, roe deer, and mandarin rat snake.[239][240][241] The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District.[242] The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of Père David's deer, now extinct in the wild. The Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007, is endemic to Beijing. The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat and Rickett's big-footed bat.[243]\n\n\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200–300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting.[244][245] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique.[246][247] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets.[245] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.[245][248]\n\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nBeijing is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:[254]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey\n* ![](image) Astana, Kazakhstan\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium\n* ![](image) Bucharest, Romania\n* ![](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt\n* ![](image) Canberra, Australia\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany\n* ![](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n* ![](image) Delhi, India\n* ![](image) Doha, Qatar\n* ![](image) Dublin, Ireland\n* ![](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![](image) Île-de-France, France\n* ![](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![](image) Jakarta, Indonesia\n* ![](image) Johannesburg, South Africa\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![](image) London, England, United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![](image) Minsk, Belarus\n* ![](image) Mexico City, Mexico\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ottawa, Canada\n* ![](image) Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n* ![](image) Riga, Latvia\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) San José, Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Estonia](image) Tallinn, Estonia\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran\n* ![](image) Tel Aviv, Israel\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan\n* ![](image) Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n* ![](image) Vientiane, Laos\n* ![](image) Washington D.C., United States\n* ![](image) Wellington, New Zealand\n\n### Foreign embassies and consulates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: list of diplomatic missions in China\nIn 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world.[255] China hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Beijing.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the second international airport in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.[15][16]\n\n\nCombining both modern and traditional style architectures, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[20] Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites—the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal—all of which are popular tourist locations.[21] Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\n\n\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.[22][23][24] Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in Asia & Oceania region and emerging countries.[25][26] Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][28] The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics,[29] and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics.[30] Beijing hosts 175 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Beijing\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 *běi* for *north* and 京 *jīng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is 京, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Beijing\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. *Homo erectus* fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic *Homo sapiens* also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[34] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\n\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City, built by the Yongle Emperor during the early Ming dynasty\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground.[42] Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (Wade–Giles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\").[43] Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\n\n![](image)Overlapping layout of Beijing during the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\n\n\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[47] It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[48] The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.[49]\n\n\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area.\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers)[50] and Beijing became China's sole capital.[51] The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\n\n\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking[a] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion. \nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers.[54] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.[55]\n\n\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.[56] The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war,[12] Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[59] and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.[60] This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing.[61]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.[63] In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up.\"\n\n\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads.[64][65] According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.[66] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,[67] while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China.[68] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country.[69] Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[70] The city has also hosted major international events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Beijing\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by *Xishan* or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556 ft).\n\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South–North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\n\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40 to 60 metres (130–200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east–west axis.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of the Forbidden City, viewed from the Jingshan Park\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North-South Central Axis of Beijing City\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Beijing\n\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.[72] Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wangjing SOHO\nBeijing is famous for its *siheyuans*, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called *hutongs*. The *hutongs* are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, *siheyuans* and *hutongs* are rapidly disappearing,[73] as entire city blocks of *hutongs* are replaced by high-rise buildings.[74] Residents of the *hutongs* are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the *hutongs* cannot be replaced,[75] and these properties are often government owned.[76]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing average annual temperatures from 1970 to 2019 during summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January, and February). Weather station data from NOAA. For comparison the Global Surface Temperature Anomaly rose by approximately one degree over the same time period. Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen: *Dwa*), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: *BSk*) and humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cwa*), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[77] Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is −3.5 °C (25.7 °F), while in July it is 26.8 °C (80.2 °F). Precipitation averages around 577 mm (23 in) annually, with close to three-quarters of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,455 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −27.4 °C (−17.3 °F) on 22 February 1966 to 41.9 °C (107.4 °F) on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) was set on 15 June 1942).[78][79]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1951–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | −1.0(30.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −4.2(24.4)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | −5.0(23.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −22.8(−9.0)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n | −15(5)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | −12.3(9.9)\n | −18.3(−0.9)\n | −27.4(−17.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 5.8(0.23)\n | 8.6(0.34)\n | 21.7(0.85)\n | 36.1(1.42)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 169.7(6.68)\n | 113.4(4.46)\n | 53.7(2.11)\n | 28.7(1.13)\n | 13.5(0.53)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 528(20.78)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 1.6\n | 2.3\n | 3.0\n | 4.7\n | 6.0\n | 10.0\n | 11.9\n | 10.5\n | 7.1\n | 5.2\n | 2.9\n | 1.6\n | 66.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 2.8\n | 2.5\n | 1.3\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.7\n | 2.8\n | 11.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 43\n | 42\n | 40\n | 43\n | 47\n | 58\n | 69\n | 71\n | 64\n | 58\n | 54\n | 46\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 188.1\n | 189.1\n | 231.1\n | 243.2\n | 265.1\n | 221.6\n | 190.5\n | 205.3\n | 206.1\n | 199.9\n | 173.4\n | 177.1\n | 2,490.5\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62\n | 62\n | 62\n | 61\n | 59\n | 50\n | 42\n | 49\n | 56\n | 59\n | 59\n | 61\n | 57\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: China Meteorological Administration[80][81] |\n| Source 2: Extremes[b] and Weather Atlas[85] |\n\n#### Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When Europeans first came into sustained contact with China, \"Pekin\" and \"Peking\" were the most popular ways of romanizing the name of Beijing.[52][53]\n2. **^** All-time record high;[79] February record high;[82] May record high;[83] June record high[84]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased.[87] Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35–60% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\",[89] partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17 billion was spent.[90] Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations,[91] and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers),[92] reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles.[93][94] The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world.[90] Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.[95]\n\n\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.[96] Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas[97] and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry.[97] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions.[96] Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015.[98] Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making.[99] Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing.[96] Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption.[98] There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014.[100] Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016.[101] Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.[101]\n\n\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area.[102] More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue,\" short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively.[103] During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\n\n\nBeijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of the city's US embassy at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the WHO, and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was \"crazy bad\". This was later changed to \"beyond index\".[104]\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.[105] Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.[106]\n\n\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.[107]\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017[108] and further reduction by 2020.[109]: 52\n\n\n\n### Readings[edit]\n\n\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).[110] The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone levels on Twitter.[111] Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.[111]\n\n\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the mobility rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing.[112] Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.[113]\n\n\n\n#### Dust storms[edit]\n\n\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.[114] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.[115] In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000 tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.[116]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Beijing\n\nThe municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Beijing CCP Secretary (Chinese: 中共北京市委书记). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\n\n\nGovernment officials include the mayor (Chinese: 市长) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[117]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township-level divisions of Beijing.\n\nBeijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county-level subdivisions including 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. On 1 July 2010, Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively. On 13 November 2015 Miyun and Yanqing were upgraded to districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Beijing** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Dongcheng**\n\n**Xicheng**\n\n**Chaoyang**\n\n**Fengtai**\n\n**Shijingshan**\n\n**Haidian**\n\n**Mentougou**\n\n**Fangshan**\n\n**Tongzhou**\n\n**Shunyi**\n\n**Changping**\n\n**Daxing**\n\n**Huairou**\n\n**Pinggu**\n\n**Miyun**\n\n**Yanqing**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area in km2[119] | Total population 2010[120] | Urban areapopulation 2010[121] | Seat\n | Postal code\n | Subdivisions[122][*full citation needed*] |\n| Subdistricts | Towns | Townships[n 1] | Residential communities | Villages |\n| 110000 | Beijing\n | 16406.16 | 19,612,368 | 16,858,692 | Dongcheng / Tongzhou | 100000 | 149 | 143 | 38 | 2538 | 3857\n |\n| 110101 | Dongcheng | 41.82 | 919,253 | Jingshan Subdistrict | 100000 | 17 |  |  | 216 |  |\n| 110102 | Xicheng | 50.33 | 1,243,315 | Jinrong Street Subdistrict | 100000 | 15 |  |  | 259 |  |\n| 110105 | Chaoyang | 454.78 | 3,545,137 | 3,532,257 | Chaowai Subdistrict | 100000 | 24 |  | 19 | 358 | 5\n |\n| 110106 | Fengtai | 305.53 | 2,112,162 | 2,098,632 | Fengtai Subdistrict | 100000 | 16 | 2 | 3 | 254 | 73\n |\n| 110107 | Shijingshan | 84.38 | 616,083 | Lugu Subdistrict | 100000 | 9 |  |  | 130 |  |\n| 110108 | Haidian | 430.77 | 3,280,670 | 3,208,563 | Haidian Subdistrict | 100000 | 22 | 7 |  | 603 | 84\n |\n| 110109 | Mentougou | 1447.85 | 290,476 | 248,547 | Dayu Subdistrict | 102300 | 4 | 9 |  | 124 | 179\n |\n| 110111 | Fangshan | 1994.73 | 944,832 | 635,282 | Gongchen Subdistrict | 102400 | 8 | 14 | 6 | 108 | 462\n |\n| 110112 | Tongzhou | 905.79 | 1,184,256 | 724,228 | Beiyuan Subdistrict | 101100 | 6 | 10 | 1 | 40 | 480\n |\n| 110113 | Shunyi | 1019.51 | 876,620 | 471,459 | Shengli Subdistrict | 101300 | 6 | 19 |  | 61 | 449\n |\n| 110114 | Changping | 1342.47 | 1,660,501 | 1,310,617 | Chengbei Subdistrict | 102200 | 8 | 14 |  | 180 | 303\n |\n| 110115 | Daxing | 1036.34 | 1,365,112 | 965,683 | Xingfeng Subdistrict | 102600 | 5 | 14 |  | 64 | 547\n |\n| 110116 | Huairou | 2122.82 | 372,887 | 253,088 | Longshan Subdistrict | 101400 | 2 | 12 | 2 | 27 | 286\n |\n| 110117 | Pinggu | 948.24 | 415,958 | 219,850 | Binhe Subdistrict | 101200 | 2 | 14 | 2 | 23 | 275\n |\n| 110118 | Miyun | 2225.92 | 467,680 | 257,449 | Gulou Subdistrict | 101500 | 2 | 17 | 1 | 57 | 338\n |\n| 110119 | Yanqing | 1994.89 | 317,426 | 154,386 | Rulin Subdistrict | 102100 | 3 | 11 | 4 | 34 | 376\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n |\n| Beijing Municipality\n | 北京市 | Běijīng Shì\n |\n| Dongcheng District | 东城区 | Dōngchéng Qū\n |\n| Xicheng District | 西城区 | Xīchéng Qū\n |\n| Chaoyang District | 朝阳区 | Cháoyáng Qū\n |\n| Fengtai District | 丰台区 | Fēngtái Qū\n |\n| Shijingshan District | 石景山区 | Shíjǐngshān Qū\n |\n| Haidian District | 海淀区 | Hǎidiàn Qū\n |\n| Mentougou District | 门头沟区 | Méntóugōu Qū\n |\n| Fangshan District | 房山区 | Fángshān Qū\n |\n| Tongzhou District | 通州区 | Tōngzhōu Qū\n |\n| Shunyi District | 顺义区 | Shùnyì Qū\n |\n| Changping District | 昌平区 | Chāngpíng Qū\n |\n| Daxing District | 大兴区 | Dàxīng Qū\n |\n| Huairou District | 怀柔区 | Huáiróu Qū\n |\n| Pinggu District | 平谷区 | Pínggǔ Qū\n |\n| Miyun District | 密云区 | Mìyún Qū\n |\n| Yanqing District | 延庆区 | Yánqìng Qū\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Including Ethnic townships & other township related subdivisions.\n\n#### Towns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of township-level divisions of Beijing\n\nBeijing's 16 county-level divisions (districts) are further subdivided into 273 lower third-level administrative units at the township level: 119 towns, 24 townships, 5 ethnic townships and 125 subdistricts.\nTowns within Beijing Municipality but outside the urban area include (but are not limited to):\n\n\n\n* Changping 昌平\n* Huairou 怀柔\n* Miyun 密云\n* Liangxiang 良乡\n* Liulimiao 琉璃庙\n* Tongzhou 通州\n* Yizhuang 亦庄\n* Tiantongyuan 天通苑\n* Beiyuan 北苑\n* Xiaotangshan 小汤山\n\nSeveral place names in Beijing end with *mén* (门), meaning \"gate\", as they were the locations of gates in the former Beijing city wall. Other place names end in *cūn* (村), meaning \"village\", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and procuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe judicial system in Beijing consists of the Supreme People's Court, the highest court in the country, the Beijing Municipal High People's Court, the high people's court of the municipality, three intermediate people's courts, one intermediate railway transport court, 14 basic people's court (one for each of the municipality's districts and counties), and one basic railway transport court. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shijingshan oversees the basic courts of Haidian, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changping and Yanqing.[123] The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Fengtai oversees the basic courts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Fangshan and Daxing.[123] The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Laiguangying, is the newest of the three intermediate people's courts and opened on 21 August 2013.[123] It oversees the district courts of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun.[123][124] Each court in Beijing has a corresponding people's procuratorate.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing products treemap, 2020\nAs of 2022[update], Beijing's nominal GDP was CN¥4.16 trillion ($619 billion in nominal, $1.016 trillion in PPP), about 3.44% of the country's GDP and ranked 13th among province-level administrative units; its nominal GDP per capita was US$28,258 (CN¥190,059) and ranked the 1st in the country.[3][125] It also ranks the tenth largest in the metropolitan economies in the world.[126] Beijing's nominal GDP is projected to reach US$1.1 trillion in 2035, ranking among the world's top 10 largest cities (together with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[127] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach US$45,000 in 2030.[128]\n\n\nDue to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world.[129] As of August 2022, Beijing has 54 Fortune Global 500 companies, more than Japan (47), the third-place country after China (145) and the United States (124).[130][131] Beijing has also been described as the \"billionaire capital of the world\".[132][133] In 2020, Beijing is the fifth wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $2 trillion.[134] Beijing is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and worldwide and making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[135] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Beijing was ranked as having the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world and fourth-most competitive in the whole Asia & Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore).[136]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020–2021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical GDP of Beijing for 1978–present (SNA2008)[138]

GDP is based on mid-year population.\n\n\n\n### Sector composition[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Taikoo Li Sanlitun shopping arcade is a destination for locals and visitors.\nThe city has a post-industrial economy that is dominated by the tertiary sector (services), which generated 83.8% of output, followed by the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) at 15.8% and the primary sector (agriculture, mining) at 0.26%.[3] The services sector is broadly diversified with professional services, wholesale and retail, information technology, commercial real estate, scientific research, and residential real estate each contributing at least 6% to the city's economy in 2022.[3][140]\n\n\nThe single largest sub-sector remains industry, whose share of overall output has shrunk to 12.1% in 2022.[3] The mix of industrial output has changed significantly since 2010 when the city announced that 140 highly-polluting, energy and water resource intensive enterprises would be relocated from the city in five years.[141] The relocation of Capital Steel to neighboring Hebei province had begun in 2005.[142][143] In 2013, output of automobiles, aerospace products, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and food processing all increased.[140]\n\n\nIn the farmland around Beijing, vegetables and fruits have displaced grain as the primary crops under cultivation.[140] In 2013, the tonnage of vegetable, edible fungus and fruit harvested was over three times that of grain.[140] In 2013, overall acreage under cultivation shrank along with most categories of produce as more land was reforested for environmental reasons.[140]\n\n\n\n### Economic zones[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of economic and technological development zones in Beijing.\n\n![](image)The skyline of Beijing CBD\n![](image)Zhongguancun is a technology hub in Haidian District.\nIn 2006, the city government identified six high-end economic output zones around Beijing as the primary engines for local economic growth. In 2012, the six zones produced 43.3% of the city's GDP, up from 36.5% in 2007.[144][145]\nThe six zones are:\n\n\n\n1. Zhongguancun, China's silicon village in Haidian District northwest of the city, is home to both established and start-up tech companies. In the first two quarters of 2014, 9,895 companies registered in the six zones, among which 6,150 were based in Zhongguancun.[146] Zhongguancun is also the center of Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.\n2. Beijing Financial Street, in Xicheng District on the west side of the city between Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen, is lined with headquarters of large state banks and insurance companies. The country's financial regulatory agencies including the central bank, bank regulator, securities regulator, and foreign exchange authority are located in the neighborhood.\n3. Beijing Central Business District (CBD), is actually located to the east of downtown, near the embassies along the eastern Third Ring Road between Jianguomenwai and Chaoyangmenwai. The CBD is home to most of the city's skyscraper office buildings. Most of the city's foreign companies and professional service firms are based in the CBD.\n4. Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area, better known as Yizhuang, is an industrial park the straddles the southern Fifth Ring Road in Daxing District. It has attracted pharmaceutical, information technology, and materials engineering companies.[147]\n5. Beijing Airport Economic Zone was created in 1993 and surrounds the Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi District northeast of the city. In addition to logistics, airline services, and trading firms, this zone is also home to Beijing's automobile assembly plants.\n6. Beijing Olympic Center Zone surrounds the Olympic Green due north of downtown and is developing into an entertainment, sports, tourism and business convention center.\n\n\nShijingshan, on the western outskirts of the city, is a traditional heavy industrial base for steel-making.[148] Chemical plants are concentrated in the far eastern suburbs.\n\n\nLess legitimate enterprises also exist. Urban Beijing is known for being a center of infringed goods; anything from the latest designer clothing to DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Beijing\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953 | 2,768,149 | —     |\n| 1964 | 7,568,495 | +9.57% |\n| 1982 | 9,230,687 | +1.11% |\n| 1990 | 10,819,407 | +2.00% |\n| 2000 | 13,569,194 | +2.29% |\n| 2010 | 19,612,368 | +3.75% |\n| 2020[138] | 21,893,095 | +1.11% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2021, Beijing had a total population of 21.89 million within the municipality, of which 19.16 million (87.5 percent) resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.73 million (12.5) lived in rural villages.[3] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 24.9 million.[150][151]\n\n\nWithin China, the city ranked second in urban population after Shanghai and the third in municipal population after Shanghai and Chongqing. Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years, especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was the largest city in the world.\n\n\nAbout 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local *hukou* permits, which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.[140] The remaining 8 million residents had *hukou* permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.[140]\n\n\nThe population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.[140] The total population in 2004 was 14.213 million.[152] The population gains are driven largely by migration. The population's rate of natural increase in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a birth rate of 8.93 and a mortality rate of 4.52.[140] The gender balance was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.[140]\n\n\nWorking age people account for nearly 73.6% of the population.[3] Compared to 2004, residents age 0–14 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.95% to 9.92% in 2013, but again increased to 12.1% in 2021.[3]\nResidents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 8.58%, but increased to 14.2% in 2021.[3] From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of city residents with at least some college education nearly doubled, from 20.4% to 37.3%, and further increased to 49.1% by 2021.[3] About 66.4% have senior secondary school education and 88.2% had reached middle school.[3]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, nearly 96% of Beijing's population are ethnic Han Chinese.[153] Of the 800,000 ethnic minority population living in the capital, Manchu (336,000), Hui (249,000), Korean (77,000), Mongol (37,000) and Tujia (24,000) constitute the five largest groups.[154] In addition, there were 8,045 Hong Kong residents, 500 Macau residents, and 7,772 Taiwan residents along with 91,128 registered foreigners living in Beijing.[153] A study by the Beijing Academy of Sciences estimates that in 2010 there were on average 200,000 foreigners living in Beijing on any given day including students, business travellers and tourists that are not counted as registered residents.[155]\n\n\nIn 2017 the Chinese government implemented population controls for Beijing and Shanghai to fight what it called the \"big city disease\" which includes congestion, pollution, and shortages of education and health care services. From this policy, Beijing's population declined by 20,000 from 2016 to 2017.[156] Some low-income people are being forcibly removed from the city as both legal and illegal housing is being demolished in some high-density residential neighborhoods.[156] The population is being redistributed to Jing-Jin-Ji and Xiong'an New Area, the transfer to the latter expected to include 300,000-500,000 people working in government research, universities, and corporate headquarters.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Beijing, Education in China, and Higher education in China\n\nSee also: Rankings of universities in China, List of universities in China, and Double First Class University Plan\nBeijing is a world leading center for scientific and technological innovation and has been ranked the No.1 city in the world with the largest scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][159][28] The city is also leading the world with the highest share of articles published in the fields of physical sciences, chemistry, and earth and environmental sciences, especially in the United Nations'17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related output.[160][161][162][163]\n\n\nBeijing has over 90 public colleges and universities, which is the largest urban public university system in Asia and the first city in China with most higher education institutions,[164][165] and it is home to the two best universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the whole of Asia-Oceania region and emerging countries with its shared rankings at 16th place in the world by the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[166][167][26] Both are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[168]\n\n\nBeijing also has the highest number of universities of any city in the country, representing more than one-fifth of 147 Double First-Class Universities, a national plan to develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions by the end of 2050.[169] A number of Beijing's most prestigious universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beihang University, Beijing Institute of Technology, China Agricultural University, Minzu University of China, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, University of International Business and Economics, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Central University of Finance and Economics.[170][22][171][172] These universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[173][174]\n\n\nThe city is a seat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been consistently ranked the No.1 research institute in the world by *Nature Index* since the list's inception in 2014, by Nature Research.[175][176][177] The academy also runs the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in Beijing and ranked among the world's top five research institutions by the Nature Index.[178] Beijing is also a site of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\nSome of the national key universities in Beijing are:\n\n* Beijing Forestry University\n* Beijing Jiaotong University\n* Beijing University of Technology\n* Beijing University of Chinese Medicine\n* Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications\n* Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute\n*

High-level Tibetan Buddhism College of China [zh] (中国藏语系高级佛学院)\n* National Seminary of Catholic Church in China (中国天主教神哲学院)\n\nThe city's compulsory education system is among the best in the world: in 2018, 15-year-old students from Beijing (together with Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu) outperformed all of the other 78 participating countries in all categories (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[179]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Beijing Ancient Observatory\nPeople native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. This speech is the basis for *putonghua*, the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.\n\n\nBeijing or Peking opera is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sliced Peking duck served with traditional condiments\nBeijing cuisine is the local style of cooking. Peking duck is perhaps the best known dish. Fuling jiabing, a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (*bing*) resembling a flat disk with a filling made from *fu ling*, a fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing.\n\n\nThe cloisonné (or *Jingtailan*, literally \"Blue of Jingtai\") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonné making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.[181] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include \"carved lacquer\" and \"engraved gold\".\n\n\nYounger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.[182] Today, Houhai, Sanlitun and Wudaokou are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.\n\n\nIn 2012 Beijing was named as City of Design and became part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[183]\n\n\n\n### Places of interest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Beijing) and List of Beijing landmarks\n\n\n> ...the city remains an epicenter of tradition with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view—in the famed Forbidden City and in the city's lush pavilions and gardens...\n> \n> — National Geographic[184]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Qianmen Avenue, a traditional commercial street outside Qianmen Gate along the southern Central Axis\n![](image)Inside the Forbidden City\nAt the historical heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;[185] the Forbidden City hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably Beihai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places, particularly Beihai Park, are described as masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,[186] and are tourist destinations of historical importance;[187] in the modern era, Zhongnanhai has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. From Tiananmen Square, right across from the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the city; the former, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[188] contains a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that served as the summer retreats for the Qing imperial family.\n\n\nAmong the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (*Tiantan*), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[189] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayers to Heaven for good harvest. In the north of the city is the Temple of Earth (*Ditan*), while the Temple of the Sun (*Ritan*) and the Temple of the Moon (*Yuetan*) lie in the eastern and western urban areas respectively.

The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the Chinese giant panda.\n\n\nThere are 144 museums and galleries (as of June 2008[update]) in the city.[190][191][192] In addition to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.[192]\n\n\nLocated at the outskirts of urban Beijing, but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[193] The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the municipality,[194] containing a wealth of discoveries, among them one of the first specimens of *Homo erectus* and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena *Pachycrocuta brevirostris*. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China,[195] most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Beijing is the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[196] Theme parks located within the city include Universal Studios Beijing and Happy Valley Beijing, both of which are among the most visited theme parks in Asia.[197]\n\n\n\n### Intangible cultural heritage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peking opera\nThe cultural heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse. Starting 2006, the Beijing government started the process of selecting and preserving cultural heritages. Five cultural heritage lists have been published over the years. 288 distinct practices are categorized as cultural heritage. These 288 cultural heritages are further divided into ten categories, namely folk music, folk dance, traditional opera, melodious art, juggling and game, folk art, traditional handicraft, traditional medicine, folk literature and folklore.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n* Folk music\n\t+ Zhihua Temple music\n\t+ Tongzhou shanty\n* Folk dance\n\t+ Tongzhou Dragon dance\n\t+ Miliangtun Stilts\n* Traditional opera\n\t+ Kunqu\n\t+ Peking opera\n* Melodious art\n\t+ Xiangsheng\n* Acrobatic Performance and game\n\t+ Weiqi(Go)\n\t+ Xiangqi\n* Folk art\n\t+ Ivory carving\n* Traditional handicraft\n\t+ Peking duck manufacturing techniques\n\t+ Cloisonné manufacturing techniques\n* Traditional medicine\n\t+ Tong Ren Tang culture\n* Folk literature\n\t+ Yongding River legend[*permanent dead link*]\n* Folklore\n\t+ Miaohui\n\t+ Lantern Festival\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThe religious heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse as Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity all have significant historical presence in the city. As the national capital, the city also hosts the State Administration for Religious Affairs and various state-sponsored institutions of the leading religions.[202] In recent decades, foreign residents have brought other religions to the city.[202] According to Wang Zhiyun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2010 there were 2.2 million Buddhists in the city, equal to 11.2% of the total population.[203] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.78% of the city's population.[204] According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 1.76% of the population of Beijing.[205]\n\n\n\n### Chinese folk religion and Taoism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fire God Temple in Di'anmen\nBeijing has many temples dedicated to folk religious and communal deities, many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s. Yearly sacrifices to the God of Heaven (祭天; *jìtiān*) at the Temple of Heaven have been resumed by Confucian groups in the 2010s.\n\n\nThere are temples dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (娘娘; *Niángniáng*) in the city, one of them near the Olympic Village, and they revolve around a major cult center at Mount Miaofeng.

Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake, while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the tallest in the world.[206][207]\n\n\nThe national Chinese Taoist Association and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the White Cloud Temple of Quanzhen Taoism, which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times.

The Big Air Shougang ski jump is in the western suburbs and was built for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[219]\n\n\n\n### Clubs[edit]\n\n\nProfessional sports teams based in Beijing include:\n\n\n\n* China Baseball League\n\t+ Beijing Tigers\n* Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Ducks\n\t+ Beijing Royal Fighters\n* Women's Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Shougang\n* Kontinental Hockey League\n\t+ HC Kunlun Red Star\n* Chinese Super League\n\t+ Beijing Guoan\n* China League Two\n\t+ Beijing BIT\n* Chinese Women's National League\n\t+ Beijing BG Phoenix\n\nThe Beijing Olympians of the American Basketball Association, formerly a Chinese Basketball Association team, kept their name and maintained a roster of primarily Chinese players after moving to Maywood, California in 2005.\n\n\nChina Bandy Federation is based in Beijing, one of several cities in which the potential for bandy development is explored.[220]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing South railway station, one of several rail stations in the city\nBeijing is an important transport hub in North China with six ring roads, 1167 km (725 miles) of expressways,[221] 15 National Highways, nine conventional railways, and six high-speed railways converging on the city.\n\n\n\n### Rail and high-speed rail[edit]\n\n\nBeijing serves as a large rail hub in China's railway network. Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: Shanghai (Jinghu Line), Guangzhou (Jingguang Line), Kowloon (Jingjiu Line), Harbin (Jingha Line) (including Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)), Baotou (Jingbao Line), Chengde (Jingcheng Line), Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line), Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line) and Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line). In addition, the Datong–Qinhuangdao railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\n\nBeijing also has six high-speed rail lines: the Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway, which opened in 2008; the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011; the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, which opened in 2012; and the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway and the Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway, both of which opened in 2019. The Beijing–Shenyang high-speed railway was completed in 2021.\n\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the Beijing railway station, which opened in 1959; the Beijing West railway station, which opened in 1996; and the Beijing South railway station, which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The Beijing North railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The Qinghe railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The Beijing Chaoyang railway station opened in 2021; The Beijing Fengtai railway station opened in 2022; and the Beijing Sub-Center railway station is under construction.\n\n\nSmaller stations in the city including Beijing East railway station and Daxing Airport station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.[222]\n\n\nFrom Beijing, direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam and North Korea. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing\n\n![](image)View of 4th Ring Road in Chaoyang District\n![](image)Traffic jam on the Beijing–Tongzhou Expressway\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the \"ring roads\" that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Beijing–Lhasa Expressway in Changping District\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.[223] The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles.[224] By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.[225]\n\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.[226] More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\n\n\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.[227]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n#### Beijing Capital International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terminal 3 of the Beijing Capital International Airport\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20 mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport.[14] Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Beijing Daxing International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Daxing International Airport\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29 mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019.[228][229][230] The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing–Xiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.\n\n\n\n#### Other airports[edit]\n\n\nWith the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n\n#### Visa requirements for air passengers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 1 January 2013[update], tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers[231] with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.[232]\n\n\n\n### Public transit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Daxing line train on the Beijing Subway, which is among the longest and busiest rapid transit systems in the world\n![](image)An articulated Beijing bus\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783 km (487 mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of ¥2.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650 mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes.[233][*better source needed*] The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\n\n\nOn 28 December 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express.[234] Under the new system a trip under 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) will cost ¥3.00(US$0.49), an additional ¥1.00 will be added for the next 6 km (3+1⁄2 mi) and the next 10 km (6 mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32 km (20 mi).[234] For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional ¥1.00 is added.[234] For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost ¥ 8.00.\n\n\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as ¥1.00 when purchased with the *Yikatong* metrocard.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at ¥13 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9 mi), ¥2.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) and ¥1 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are ¥2.3 (¥4.6 during rush hours of 7–9 am and 5–7 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5 mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, Citroëns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3 mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion *over* that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11 pm and 5 am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15 km (9 mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.[235] On 30 March 2019, a 6.5 km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies.[236] Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.[237]\n\n\n\n## Defence and aerospace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\n\n\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\n\n\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, in Haidian District tracks the country's crewed and uncrewed flight and other space exploration initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Nature and wildlife[edit]\n\n\nBeijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7 km2 (517.3 sq mi).[238] The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard, leopard cat, wolf, red fox, wild boar, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, hog badger, Siberian weasel, Amur hedgehog, roe deer, and mandarin rat snake.[239][240][241] The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District.[242] The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of Père David's deer, now extinct in the wild. The Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007, is endemic to Beijing. The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat and Rickett's big-footed bat.[243]\n\n\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200–300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting.[244][245] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique.[246][247] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets.[245] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.[245][248]\n\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nBeijing is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:[254]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey\n* ![](image) Astana, Kazakhstan\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium\n* ![](image) Bucharest, Romania\n* ![](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt\n* ![](image) Canberra, Australia\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany\n* ![](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n* ![](image) Delhi, India\n* ![](image) Doha, Qatar\n* ![](image) Dublin, Ireland\n* ![](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![](image) Île-de-France, France\n* ![](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![](image) Jakarta, Indonesia\n* ![](image) Johannesburg, South Africa\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![](image) London, England, United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![](image) Minsk, Belarus\n* ![](image) Mexico City, Mexico\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ottawa, Canada\n* ![](image) Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n* ![](image) Riga, Latvia\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) San José, Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Estonia](image) Tallinn, Estonia\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran\n* ![](image) Tel Aviv, Israel\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan\n* ![](image) Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n* ![](image) Vientiane, Laos\n* ![](image) Washington D.C., United States\n* ![](image) Wellington, New Zealand\n\n### Foreign embassies and consulates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: list of diplomatic missions in China\nIn 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world.[255] China hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Beijing.

With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the fifth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\n\n\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of France,[2] making the region France's primate city. The Paris Region had a GDP of €765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\n\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[15] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[16]\n\n\nParis hosts several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, and other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924, and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee Wiktionary for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.\n\nThe ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as *Luteciam Parisiorum* ('Lutetia of the Parisii')*,* and is later attested as *Parision* in the 5th century AD, then as *Paris* in 1265.[17][18] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as *Lutetia* or *Lutecia* in Latin, and as *Leukotekía* in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *\\*lukot-* ('mouse'), or from \\**luto-* ('marsh, swamp').[19][20][18]\n\n\nThe name *Paris* is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period.[21] The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root *pario-* ('cauldron').[21] Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh *peryff* ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as \\**kwar-is-io*-.[22] Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate *Parisii* as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish *carr* ('spear'), derived from an earlier \\**kwar-sā*.[18] In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.\n\n\nInhabitants are known in English as \"Parisians\" and in French as *Parisiens* ([paʁizjɛ̃] ⓘ). They are also pejoratively called *Parigots* ([paʁiɡo] ⓘ).[note 1][23]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Paris\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Paris.\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lutetia\n\nThe *Parisii*, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[24][25] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité, which gradually became an important trading centre.[26] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC)\nThe Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris's Left Bank.[28] The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, *Lutetia Parisiorum*, \"Lutetia of the Parisii\", modern French *Lutèce*). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.[29]\n\n\nBy the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as *Parisius*, a Latin name that would later become *Paris* in French.[30] Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as *Mons Martyrum* (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.[31]\n\n\nClovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508.[32] As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for which the then Count of Paris (*comte de Paris*), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia.[33] From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (*duc des Francs*), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.[31]\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the Middle Ages, Paris in the 16th century, and Paris in the 17th century\n\n![The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410)](image)The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410)\nBy the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.[34] The Palais de la Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.\n\n\nAfter the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century,[35] Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville).[36] The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.\n\n\nIn the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.[37] In 1190, he transformed Paris's former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.[38][34]\n\n\nWith 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants. By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by *merde*, the French word for \"shit\".[39][40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel de Sens (c. 15th–16th), former residence of the Archbishop of Sens\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420;[41] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city,[42] it would remain under English occupation until 1436.\n\n\nIn the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.[43][44] The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris's first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris's streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.[45]\n\n\nDuring the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lutetia Parisiorum vulgo Paris, Plan de Paris en 1657, Jan Janssonius\nDue to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the *Grands Boulevards*.[47] Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.[48]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the 18th century, Paris during the Second Empire, and Haussmann's renovation of Paris\n\nParis grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640, to 650,000 in 1780.[49] A new boulevard named the Champs-Élysées extended the city west to Étoile,[50] while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern side of the city grew increasingly crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël\n![](image)The Panthéon, a major landmark on the Rive Gauche, was completed in 1790.\nParis was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity, known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their *Encyclopédie* in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot air balloon on 21 November 1783. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, and the primary European centre of book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.[52]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, which was a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the *Hôtel de Ville* and elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, on 15 July.[53]\n\n\nLouis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen and mayor were beheaded by guillotine in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.[54] The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.[55] A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (*coup d'état du 18 brumaire*), when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.[56]\n\n\nThe population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815.[57] Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect that reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower, under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians—and the world—with its modernity.\nDuring the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille) brought to power a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.[57] In 1848, Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris. His successor, Napoleon III, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a huge public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes.[58] In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.[58]\n\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28 March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the Belle Époque, Paris during the First World War, Paris between the Wars (1919–1939), Paris in World War II, and History of Paris (1946–2000)\n\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art,[63][64] and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.[65]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[66] In the years after the war, known as *Les Années Folles*, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet[67] and Salvador Dalí.[68]\n\n\nIn the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944\nOn 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an \"open city\".[70] On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the *Vel d'Hiv* (*Vélodrome d'Hiver*), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back.[71][72] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.[73]\n\n\nIn the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.[74][75]\n\n\nIn May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.[76] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.[77] The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 m (689 ft) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.[78] The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs.[79] A suburban railway network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.[80]\n\n\nMost of the postwar presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand had the Opéra Bastille built (1985–1989), the new site of the *Bibliothèque nationale de France* (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989) in La Défense, as well as the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.[81]\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor. He was re-elected in March 2008.[82] In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Demonstrators at the Place de la République, Paris, 11 January 2015, during the Republican marches after the *Charlie Hebdo* shooting\nIn 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016.[84] In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 km (127 mi) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion.[85] The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.[86]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed attacks across the Paris region.[87][88] 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech.[89] In November of the same year, terrorist attacks, claimed by ISIL,[90] killed 130 people and injured more than 350.[91]\n\n\nOn 22 April 2016, the Paris Agreement was signed by 196 nations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in an aim to limit the effects of climate change below 2 °C.[92]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Paris\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Paris, captured by ESA's Sentinel-2 mission\nParis is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (*La Manche*) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.[93] Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).[94]\n\n\nExcluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique.[95] The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi).[96] The metropolitan area is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).[93]\n\n\nMeasured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is 450 km (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 km (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 km (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 km (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 km (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 km (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.[97]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Paris\n\n![](image)Autumn in Paris\nParis has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet.[98] Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.[99] Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night.[100] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and cool nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.[101] In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F).[102] Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below −5 °C (23 °F). The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.[103]\n\n\nParis has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However, the city is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) on 25 July 2019,[104] and the lowest was −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on 10 December 1879.[105]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Paris (Parc Montsouris), elevation: 75 m (246 ft), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1872–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 37.6(99.7)\n | 42.6(108.7)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 36.2(97.2)\n | 28.9(84.0)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 42.6(108.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 9.9(49.8)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −14.6(5.7)\n | −14.7(5.5)\n | −9.1(15.6)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | −0.1(31.8)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | −14.0(6.8)\n | −23.9(−11.0)\n | −23.9(−11.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 47.6(1.87)\n | 41.8(1.65)\n | 45.2(1.78)\n | 45.8(1.80)\n | 69.0(2.72)\n | 51.3(2.02)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 58.0(2.28)\n | 44.7(1.76)\n | 55.2(2.17)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 62.0(2.44)\n | 634.3(24.97)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 9.9\n | 9.1\n | 9.5\n | 8.6\n | 9.2\n | 8.3\n | 7.4\n | 8.1\n | 7.5\n | 9.5\n | 10.4\n | 11.4\n | 108.9\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 3.0\n | 3.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.7\n | 2.1\n | 11.9\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 83\n | 78\n | 73\n | 69\n | 70\n | 69\n | 68\n | 71\n | 76\n | 82\n | 84\n | 84\n | 76\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 59.0\n | 83.7\n | 134.9\n | 177.3\n | 201.0\n | 203.5\n | 222.4\n | 215.3\n | 174.7\n | 118.6\n | 69.8\n | 56.9\n | 1,717\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 22\n | 29\n | 37\n | 43\n | 43\n | 42\n | 46\n | 48\n | 46\n | 35\n | 25\n | 22\n | 37\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 7\n | 7\n | 6\n | 4\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: Meteo France (snow days 1981–2010),[106] Infoclimat.fr (relative humidity 1961–1990)[107] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[108] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administration of Paris\n\n### City government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Arrondissements of Paris and List of mayors of Paris\n\n![](image)A map of the arrondissements of Paris\nFor almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.[109] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014[110] and re-elected 28 June 2020.[111]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel de Ville, or city hall\nThe mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the *Conseil de Paris* (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system. Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.[112] This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.[113]\n\n\nPrior to the 2020 Paris municipal election, each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (*conseil d'arrondissement*), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[114] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[109] The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Métropole du Grand Paris[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Greater Paris Metropolis and its governing territories\nThe Métropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016.[116] It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 km2 (314 sq mi) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.[117][118]\n\n\nThe new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment.[116][118] The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.[119]\n\n\n\n### Regional government[edit]\n\n\nThe Region of Île de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, composed of 209 members representing its different communes. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.[120]\n\n\n\n### National government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Élysée Palace, official residence of the President of France\nAs the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace,[121] while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon.[122][123] Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the Hôtel Matignon.[124]\n\n\nBoth houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg, while the more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palais-Royal, residence of the Conseil d'État\nFrance's highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the *Île de la Cité*,[126] while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement.[127] The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.[128]\n\n\nParis and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.\n\n\n\n### Police force[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police (Gendarmerie) motorcyclists\nThe security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité.[129]\n\n\nThere are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.[129] The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.[130]\n\n\nCrime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.[131]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower in a full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left)\n\n### Urbanism and architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Paris, Haussmann's renovation of Paris, Religious buildings in Paris, and List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region\n\n![](image)Rue de Rivoli\n![](image)Place des Vosges\nParis is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. For this, even its earliest history is still visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty played a large part in giving the city the reputation it has today.[132] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité. A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes.\n\n\nModern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey \"Paris stone\". They also built the major parks around the city centre.[133] The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.[134]\n\n\nParis's urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century,[135] particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned.[135] The 210 m (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building since 1973,[136] but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front de Seine development along the river Seine\nThe most expensive residential street in Paris in 2018 by average price per square metre was Avenue Montaigne, at 22,372 euros per square metre.[137] The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).[138]\n\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.[141]\n\n\n\n### Suburbs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Western Paris in 2016, as photographed by a SkySat satellite\n![](image)West of Paris seen from Tour Montparnasse in 2019\nAside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent \"District de la région parisienne\" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed \"Île-de-France\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.[142] Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.[116]\n\n\nParis's disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs *mésentente* when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:[143] two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban \"villes nouvelles\" (\"new cities\")[144] and the RER commuter train network.[145] Many other suburban residential districts (*grands ensembles*) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:[146] These districts were socially mixed at first,[147] but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).[148] Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.[148]\n\n\nThese areas, *quartiers sensibles* (\"sensitive quarters\"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.[149]\n\n\nThe Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class dotted with wealthy islands located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.[150]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Paris\n\n![](image)City of Paris population pyramid in 2022\n\n\n| 2019 Census Paris Region |\n| --- |\n| (*Île-de-France*)[151][152] |\n| \n\n|  Country/territoryof birth |  Population |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![France](image) Metropolitan France |  9,215,134 |\n| ![Algeria](image) Algeria |  330,935 |\n| ![Morocco](image) Morocco |  253,518 |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portugal |  234,399 |\n| ![Tunisia](image) Tunisia |  127,827 |\n| ![](image) Guadeloupe |  81,269 |\n| ![](image) Martinique |  75,959 |\n| ![China](image) China |  71,500 |\n| ![Turkey](image) Turkey |  67,982 |\n| ![Mali](image) Mali |  66,085 |\n| ![Ivory Coast](image) Côte d'Ivoire |  63,810 |\n| ![Senegal](image) Senegal |  60,124 |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy |  58,141 |\n| ![Romania](image) Romania |  53,848 |\n| ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Democratic Republic of Congo |  52,449 |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain |  45,828 |\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) Sri Lanka |  45,786 |\n| ![Cameroon](image) Cameroon |  45,370 |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Other countries/territories |\n| --- |\n| ![Republic of the Congo](image) Republic of the Congo |  38,651 |\n| ![Haiti](image) Haiti |  36,685 |\n| ![Poland](image) Poland |  35,871 |\n| ![Vietnam](image) Vietnam |  35,251 |\n| ![Cambodia](image) Cambodia |  30,321 |\n| ![](image) Réunion |  30,077 |\n| ![India](image) India |  29,623 |\n| ![Serbia](image) Serbia |  25,632 |\n| ![Lebanon](image) Lebanon |  21,066 |\n| ![Madagascar](image) Madagascar |  21,002 |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany |  20,523 |\n| ![Pakistan](image) Pakistan |  20,178 |\n| ![Russia](image) Russia |  19,019 |\n| ![Mauritius](image) Mauritius |  18,840 |\n| ![Guinea](image) Guinea |  18,709 |\n| ![Brazil](image) Brazil |  17,887 |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) United Kingdom |  17,789 |\n| ![United States](image) United States |  17,583 |\n| ![United Nations](image) Other countries and territories |  857,720 |\n\n |\n\n\nThe official estimated population of the City of Paris on 1 January 1, 2023 was 2,102,650, down from 2,165,423 on January 1, 2022, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\nParis is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the *agglomération Parisienne*, and statistically as a *unité urbaine* (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical *aire d'attraction* de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\n\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.[166][*verification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nUnder French law, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth are defined as immigrants. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific.[167]\n\n\nIn the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.[168]\n\n\nIn 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).[169][170]\n\n\nIn 2020–2021, about 6 million people, or 41% of the population of the Paris Region, were either immigrants (21%) or had at least one immigrant parent (20%); these figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.[171]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religious buildings in Paris\n\n![](image)Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world.[172] French census data does not contain information about religious affiliation.[173] According to a 2011 survey by the Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), a French public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish and 25 percent as without religion.\n\n\nAccording to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.[174][175] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\n\n\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Paris\n\n![](image)La Défense, the largest dedicated business district in Europe[179]\n![](image)The headquarters of BNP Paribas, the largest banking group in Europe, in the Boulevard des Italiens[180]\n![](image)Axa headquarters at 25 Avenue Matignon\n![](image)Crédit Agricole headquarters in Montrouge[181]\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The story is similar in the Paris Region (Île-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.[183]\n\n\nAt the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.[184][185]\n\n\nThe Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 *pôles d'emplois* or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or *quartier central des affaires*; in 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.[186] The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense, just west of the city. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Défense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.[186]\n\n\nThe top French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2021 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region; six in the central business district of the City of Paris; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La Défense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt. Some companies, like Société Générale, have offices in both Paris and La Défense. The Paris Region is France's leading region for economic activity, with a GDP of €742 billion and €59,400 per capita[187] or around 1/3 of the economy of France in 2019.[187]: 12 In 2021, its GDP ranked first among the metropolitan regions of the EU and its per-capita GDP PPP was the 8th highest.[188][189][190] While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2019,[191] the Paris region's GDP accounted for 32 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.[192][193]\n\n\nThe Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.).[194] The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris's economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the *Opéra Garnier*, *La Défense* and the *Val de Seine*.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\n\n\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195] In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.[196] Station F is a business incubator for startups, noted as the world's largest startup facility.[197]\n\n\n\n### Employment and income[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Median income in Paris and its nearest departments in 2018 (high income in red, low income in yellow)\nThe majority of Paris's salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements.[198] Paris's financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district.[198] Paris's department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ ten percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade.[198] Fourteen percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals.[198] Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the State in either administration or education. The majority of Paris's healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements.[198] Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600,[194] and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.[194]\n\n\nParis's manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs, and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades.[194] The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000.[194] Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroën plants (this department alone employs 33,000),[194] but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroën assembly plant.[194] The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology,[194] and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages.[194] The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.[194]\n\n\nIncomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area.[199] While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; in the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line.[200] The unemployment rate in Paris in the 4th trimester of 2021 was six percent, compared with 7.4 percent in the whole of France. This was the lowest rate in thirteen years.[201][202]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Paris\n\nFurther information: Landmarks in Paris, Historical quarters of Paris, and List of tourist attractions in Paris\n\n![](image)Louvre, the most-visited art museum in the world\nTourism continued to recover in the Paris region in 2022, increasing to 44 million visitors, an increase of 95 percent over 2021, but still 13 percent lower than in 2019.[203]\n\n\nGreater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received a record 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel arrivals.[204] These included 12.2 million French visitors. Of the foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).[204]\n\n\nIn 2018, measured by the Euromonitor Global Cities Destination Index, Paris was the second-busiest airline destination in the world, with 19.10 million visitors, behind Bangkok (22.78 million) but ahead of London (19.09 million).[205] According to the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, 393,008 workers in Greater Paris, or 12.4 percent of the total workforce, are engaged in tourism-related sectors such as hotels, catering, transport and leisure.[206]\n\n\nThe city's top cultural attractions in 2022 were the Louvre Museum (7.7 million visitors), the Eiffel Tower (5.8 million visitors), the Musée d'Orsay (3.27 million visitors) and the Centre Pompidou (3 million visitors).[203]\n\n\nIn 2019, Greater Paris had 2,056 hotels, including 94 five-star hotels, with a total of 121,646 rooms.[204] Also in 2019, in addition to the hotels, Greater Paris had 60,000 homes registered with Airbnb.[204] Under French law, renters of these units must pay the Paris tourism tax. The company paid the city government 7.3 million euros in 2016.[207][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nA minuscule fraction of foreign visitors suffer from Paris syndrome when their experiences do not meet expectations.[208]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Painting and sculpture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Art in Paris\n\n![](image)Auguste Renoir, *Bal du moulin de la Galette*, 1876, oil on canvas, 131 cm × 175 cm (52 in × 69 in), Musée d'Orsay\nFor centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\".[209] Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the *Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture* (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.[210]\n\n\nParis was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault.[210] Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris.[210] In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.[211] Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris.\n\n\nThe most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of *Christ the Redeemer* in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Paris\n\n![](image)Musée d'Orsay\nThe Louvre received 2,8 million visitors in 2021, up from 2.7 million in 2020,[212] holding its position as first among the most-visited museums. Its treasures include the *Mona Lisa* (*La Joconde*), the *Venus de Milo* statue, and *Liberty Leading the People*. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2021, with 1.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne The third most visited Paris museum in 2021 was the National Museum of Natural History with 1,4 million visitors. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. It was followed by the Musée d'Orsay, featuring 19th century art and the French Impressionists, which had one million visitors. Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cité des sciences et de l'industrie, (984,000 visitors in 2020). The other most-visited Paris museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Musée Carnavalet (History of Paris) (606,000), and the Petit Palais, the art museum of the City of Paris (518,000).[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Musée du quai Branly\nThe Musée de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large *Water Lilies* murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or *Musée national des arts asiatiques*, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix.\n\n\nThe military history of France is presented by displays at the Musée de l'Armée at Les Invalides. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris.[214] There are also notable private museums. The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nThe largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.[215] In the middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre de la Ville).[216] Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Comédie Française (Salle Richelieu)\nTheatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Comédie-Française, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal.[217] Other famous theatres include the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador; and the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse.[218]\n\n\nThe music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The *Moulin Rouge* was opened in 1889 and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the *Folies Bergère*. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.\n\n\nThe Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include *Le Lido*, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.[219]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Writers in Paris\n\n![](image)Victor Hugo\nThe first book printed in France, *Epistolae* (\"Letters\"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, Charles Perrault,[220] several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the Académie française.[221] In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais.\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris.[222] Another of Victor Hugo's works, *Les Misérables*, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s.[223] One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.[224][*verification needed*]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, André Gide, François Mauriac, André Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier and, Arturo Uslar Pietri. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano, based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.[225]\n\n\nParis is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris.[226] It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.[227]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Paris and History of music in Paris\n\n![](image)Olympia, a famous music hall\n![](image)Umm Kulthum checking a banner for her concert in Olympia, 12 November 1967\nIn the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouvères of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of François I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established.[210] In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and François Couperin.[210] The *Conservatoire de Musique de Paris* was founded in 1795.[228] By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.\n\n\nRomantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, Camille Saint-Saëns, Léo Delibes and Jules Massenet, among others.[210] Georges Bizet's *Carmen* premiered 3 March 1875. *Carmen* has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon.[229][230] Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel . Several foreign-born composers, such as Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Jacques Offenbach, Niccolò Paganini, and Igor Stravinsky, established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris.\n\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls.[231] Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\n\n\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\n\n\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.[235]\n\n\nSome of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the cafés of the city at night.[234] Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord.[233][234] Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine.[236] The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967.[237] December 2015 was the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf—widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars.[238]\n\n\nParis has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s.[239] The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, giving political and social status for many minorities.[240]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of films set in Paris\n\n![](image)Salah Zulfikar and Sabah in *Paris and Love* (1972)\nThe movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Café on 28 December 1895.[241] Many of Paris's concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Paris's largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.[242]  \nBig multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.[243]\n\n\nParisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (*réalisateurs*) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated.[244]\n\n\n\n### Restaurants and cuisine[edit]\n\n\nSee also: French cuisine\n\n![](image)Le Zimmer, on the Place du Châtelet\nSince the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and *haute cuisine*, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.[245] The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the *Belle Époque*, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.[246]\n\n\nToday, due to Paris's cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.[247] The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick Alléno and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.[248][249]\n\n\n\n![](image)Les Deux Magots café on Boulevard Saint-Germain\nParis has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.[246] A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.[250] A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867, it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.[251]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fashion in Paris\n\n![](image)Magdalena Frackowiak at Paris Fashion Week (Fall 2011)\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).[252] It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar.[253][254] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier.[255] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine.\n\n\n\n### Photography[edit]\n\n\nThe inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s.[210] The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard.[256][257] Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which *Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville* has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[210] Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.[210]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1826, *Le Figaro* is still considered a newspaper of record.[258]\nParis and its close suburbs are home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including *Le Monde*, *Le Figaro*, *Libération*, *Le Nouvel Observateur*, *Le Canard enchaîné*, *La Croix*, *Le Parisien* (in *Saint-Ouen*), *Les Échos*, *Paris Match (Neuilly-sur-Seine)*, *Réseaux & Télécoms*, Reuters France, l'Équipe (Boulogne-Billancourt) and *L'Officiel des Spectacles*.[259] France's two most prestigious newspapers, *Le Monde* and *Le Figaro*, are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry.[260] Agence France-Presse is France's oldest, and one of the world's oldest, continually operating news agencies. AFP, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in Paris, as it has since 1835.[261] France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government, and is based in Paris.[262] Another news agency is France Diplomatie, owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.[263]\n\n\nThe most-viewed network in France, TF1, is in nearby Boulogne-Billancourt. France 2, France 3, Canal+, France 5, M6 (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Arte, D8, W9, NT1, NRJ 12, La Chaîne parlementaire, France 4, BFM TV, and Gulli are other stations located in and around the capital.[264] Radio France, France's public radio broadcaster, and its various channels, is headquartered in Paris's 16th arrondissement. Radio France Internationale, another public broadcaster is also based in the city.[265] Paris also holds the headquarters of the La Poste, France's national postal carrier.[266]\n\n\n\n### Holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nBastille Day, a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the Eiffel Tower.[267]\n\n\nSome other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, a festive summertime event when the Right Bank of the Seine is converted into a temporary beach;[267] Journées du Patrimoine, Fête de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cinéma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and Fête des jardins. The Carnaval de Paris, one of the oldest festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries in Paris\n\nThe *Bibliothèque nationale de France* (BnF) operates public libraries in Paris, among them the François Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Opéra Library, and Arsenal Library.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sainte-Geneviève Library\nThe Forney Library, in the Marais district, is dedicated to the decorative arts; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building, and has a large collection on French literature; and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris, also in Le Marais, contains the Paris historical research service. The Sainte-Geneviève Library, designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s, contains a rare book and manuscript division.[269] Bibliothèque Mazarine is the oldest public library in France. The Médiathèque Musicale Mahler opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music. The François Mitterrand Library (nicknamed *Très Grande Bibliothèque*) was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.[269]\n\n\nThere are several academic libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library is the largest university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Archéologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ibériques.[270] Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo da Vinci University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the René Descartes University Library.[271]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Paris\n\n![](image)Parc des Princes\nParis's most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[272] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Three UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000, 2006 and 2022.[273] Paris hosted UEFA Euro 2016.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)2010 Tour de France, Champs Élysées\nThe final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris. Since 1975, the race has finished on the Champs-Elysées.[274]\nTennis is another popular sport in Paris and throughout France; the French Open, held every year on the red clay of the Roland Garros National Tennis Centre,[275] is one of the four Grand Slam events of the world professional tennis tour. The 17,000-seat Bercy Arena (officially named *AccorHotels Arena* and formerly known as the *Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy*) is the venue for the annual Paris Masters ATP Tour tennis tournament. The Bercy Arena also hosted the 2017 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, together with Cologne, Germany. The final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1951 and EuroBasket 1999 were also played in Paris, the latter at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy.\n\n\nThe basketball team Levallois Metropolitans plays some of its games at the 4,000 capacity Stade Pierre de Coubertin.[276] Another top-level professional team, Nanterre 92, plays in Nanterre.\n\n\nIn 2023, a professional American football team, the Paris Saints, were formed in the city[277] joining the European League of Football.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Paris\n\n![](image)The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in Europe.\nParis is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region.[278] The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the Métro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.[279]\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 INSEE survey, a majority of Parisians (64.3 percent) use public transport to get to work. Only 10.6 percent commuted to work by automobile. 10.5 percent walked or used roller skates; 5.5 percent commuted by bicycle; and 4.4 percent commuted by motorbike.[280] Bike lanes are being doubled, while electric car incentives are being created. The French capital is banning the most polluting automobiles from key districts.[281][282]\n\n\n\n#### Railways[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Paris railway stations\n\nMain articles: Paris Métro, Réseau Express Régional, Transilien, and Tramways in Île-de-France\n\n![](image)The Paris Métro is the busiest subway network in the European Union.\nA central hub of the national rail network, Paris's six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: high-speed rail lines (TGV, Eurostar, Thalys, Intercity Express, Frecciarossa), normal speed trains (Intercités, Intercités de nuit, TER), and the suburban rails (Transilien). The Transilien is the commuter rail network serving Paris region through 8 lines, 392 stations and 1,294 km (804.1 mi) of rails.\n\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[283] through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and 226.9 km (141.0 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is 164.4 kilometres (102.2 mi) long with 248 stations.\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 2020, Charles de Gaulle Airport was the busiest airport in Europe and the eighth-busiest airport in the world.[284]\nParis is a major international air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly Airport and Beauvais–Tillé Airport. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 112 million passengers in 2019.[285] There is also one general aviation airport, Paris–Le Bourget Airport, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.[286] For 2017 it was the 5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France.[287] Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located 69 km (43 mi) north of Paris's city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers.\n\n\n\n#### Motorways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Boulevard Périphérique\nThe city is also the most important hub of France's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the Périphérique,[95] which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways.\n\n\n\n#### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nThe Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhône, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Cycling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vélib' at the Place de la Bastille\nThere are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include *piste cyclable* (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers) and *bande cyclable* (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles.[289] Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a bike sharing system called Vélib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations.[290]\n\n\n\n### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nElectricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. In 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France came from cogeneration energy plants; other energy sources included thermal power (35%), waste incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power.[291] A quarter of the city's district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and wood pellets.[292]\n\n\n\n### Water and sanitation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view of the Seine, the Île de la Cité and a Bateau Mouche\nParis in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bièvre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.[293] From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs.[294] From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris's principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris's streets. This system is still a major part of Paris's water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground sewers.[295]\n\n\nAir pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 μg/m3.[296] From the point of view of nitrogen dioxide pollution, Paris has one of the highest levels in the EU.[297]\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of parks and gardens in Paris and History of Parks and Gardens of Paris\n\n![](image)The lawns of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont on a sunny day\nParis today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.[298] Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden (created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672)[299] and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate.[300] The *Jardin des plantes* was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626.[301]\n\n\nBetween 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.[302] Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007).[303] One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay, has floating gardens.\n\n\n\n### Cemeteries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Paris Catacombs hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.\nDuring the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.[304][305]\n\n\nAfter a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.[306] Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux.[307] Famous people buried in Parisian cemeteries include Oscar Wilde, Frédéric Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg.[308]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Paris\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne University\nParis is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a *licence*-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[309] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[310]\n\n\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[311]\n\n\nThe Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the *grandes écoles* – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered *grands établissements*. Most of the *grandes écoles* were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.[312]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel-Dieu de Paris is the oldest hospital in the city.\nHealth care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals.[313] It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.[313]\n\n\nOne of the most notable hospitals is the Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city and the oldest worldwide still operating,[314] although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (one of the largest in Europe), Hôpital Cochin, Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, Bicêtre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisière Hospital, Necker–Enfants Malades Hospital, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Hôpital de la Charité and the American Hospital of Paris.\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### International organisations[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in Paris since November 1958. Paris is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[315] Paris hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in France\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Paris is exclusively and reciprocally twinned with:[316][317]\n\n\n\n* ![Italy](image) Rome, 1956\n\n\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[318]\n### Other relationships[edit]\n\n\nParis has agreements of friendship and co-operation with:[316]\n\n\n\n* ![Algeria](image) Algiers, 2003\n* ![Jordan](image) Amman, 1987\n* ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam, 2013\n* ![Greece](image) Athens, 2000\n* ![China](image) Beijing, 1997\n* ![Lebanon](image) Beirut, 1992\n* ![Germany](image) Berlin, 1987\n* ![Republic of the Congo](image) Brazzaville, 2015\n* ![Argentina](image) Buenos Aires, 1999\n* ![Egypt](image) Cairo, 1985\n* ![Morocco](image) Casablanca, 2004\n* ![United States](image) Chicago, 1996\n* ![Denmark](image) Copenhagen, 2005\n* ![Senegal](image) Dakar, 2011\n* ![Qatar](image) Doha, 2010\n* ![Switzerland](image) Geneva, 2002\n* ![Turkey](image) Istanbul, 2009\n* ![Indonesia](image) Jakarta, 1995\n* ![State of Palestine](image) Jericho, 2009\n* ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Kinshasa, 2014\n* ![Japan](image) Kyoto, 1958\n* ![Portugal](image) Lisbon, 1998\n* ![United Kingdom](image) London, 2001\n* ![Spain](image) Madrid, 2000\n* ![Mexico](image) Mexico City, 1999\n* ![Uruguay](image) Montevideo, 2013\n* ![Canada](image) Montreal, 2006\n* ![Russia](image) Moscow, 1992\n* ![Cambodia](image) Phnom Penh, 2007\n* ![Brazil](image) Porto Alegre, 2001\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Prague, 1997\n* ![Canada](image) Quebec City, 1996\n* ![Morocco](image) Rabat, 2004\n* ![State of Palestine](image) Ramallah, 2011\n* ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro, 2009\n* ![Saudi Arabia](image) Riyadh, 1997\n* ![Russia](image) Saint Petersburg, 1997\n* ![Yemen](image) Sanaa, 1987\n* ![United States](image) San Francisco, 1996\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, 1997\n* ![Brazil](image) São Paulo, 2004\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, 1991\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Sofia, 1998\n* ![Australia](image) Sydney, 1998\n* ![Georgia (country)](image) Tbilisi, 1997\n* ![Israel](image) Tel Aviv, 2010\n* ![Japan](image) Tokyo, 1982\n* ![Tunisia](image) Tunis, 2004\n* ![Poland](image) Warsaw, 1999\n* ![United States](image) Washington, D.C., 2000\n* ![Armenia](image) Yerevan, 1998\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Art Nouveau in Paris\n* Art Deco in Paris\n* C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts held in Paris in 1925\n* Megacity\n* Outline of France\n* Outline of Paris\n* Paris syndrome\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower popular class who spoke \\*argot\\*, then \\*parigot\\*was used in a provocative manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians in general.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.

With an official estimated population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km2 (41 sq mi),[5] Paris is the fifth-most populated city in the European Union and the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, gastronomy and many areas. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its early and extensive system of street lighting, in the 19th century, it became known as the City of Light.[7]\n\n\nThe City of Paris is the centre of the Île-de-France region, or Paris Region, with an official estimated population of 12,271,794 inhabitants on January 1, 2023, or about 19% of the population of France,[2] making the region France's primate city. The Paris Region had a GDP of €765 billion (US$1.064 trillion, PPP)[8] in 2021, the highest in the European Union.[9] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey, in 2022, Paris was the city with the ninth-highest cost of living in the world.[10]\n\n\nParis is a major railway, highway, and air-transport hub served by two international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport (the third-busiest airport in Europe) and Orly Airport.[11][12] Opened in 1900, the city's subway system, the Paris Métro, serves 5.23 million passengers daily;[13] it is the second-busiest metro system in Europe after the Moscow Metro. Gare du Nord is the 24th-busiest railway station in the world and the busiest outside Japan, with 262 million passengers in 2015.[14] Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks: the Louvre received 7.8 million visitors in 2022, keeping its position as the most-visited art museum in the world.[15] The Musée d'Orsay, Musée Marmottan Monet and Musée de l'Orangerie are noted for their collections of French Impressionist art. The Pompidou Centre Musée National d'Art Moderne has the largest collection of modern and contemporary art in Europe and Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso. The historical district along the Seine in the city centre has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991.[16]\n\n\nParis hosts several United Nations organizations including UNESCO, and other international organizations such as the OECD, the OECD Development Centre, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Energy Agency, the International Federation for Human Rights, along with European bodies such as the European Space Agency, the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade Français are based in Paris. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the neighbouring commune of Saint-Denis. Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900 and 1924, and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016 UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee Wiktionary for the name of Paris in various languages other than English and French.\n\nThe ancient oppidum that corresponds to the modern city of Paris was first mentioned in the mid-1st century BC by Julius Caesar as *Luteciam Parisiorum* ('Lutetia of the Parisii')*,* and is later attested as *Parision* in the 5th century AD, then as *Paris* in 1265.[17][18] During the Roman period, it was commonly known as *Lutetia* or *Lutecia* in Latin, and as *Leukotekía* in Greek, which is interpreted as either stemming from the Celtic root *\\*lukot-* ('mouse'), or from \\**luto-* ('marsh, swamp').[19][20][18]\n\n\nThe name *Paris* is derived from its early inhabitants, the Parisii, a Gallic tribe from the Iron Age and the Roman period.[21] The meaning of the Gaulish ethnonym remains debated. According to Xavier Delamarre, it may derive from the Celtic root *pario-* ('cauldron').[21] Alfred Holder interpreted the name as 'the makers' or 'the commanders', by comparing it to the Welsh *peryff* ('lord, commander'), both possibly descending from a Proto-Celtic form reconstructed as \\**kwar-is-io*-.[22] Alternatively, Pierre-Yves Lambert proposed to translate *Parisii* as the 'spear people', by connecting the first element to the Old Irish *carr* ('spear'), derived from an earlier \\**kwar-sā*.[18] In any case, the city's name is not related to the Paris of Greek mythology.\n\n\nInhabitants are known in English as \"Parisians\" and in French as *Parisiens* ([paʁizjɛ̃] ⓘ). They are also pejoratively called *Parigots* ([paʁiɡo] ⓘ).[note 1][23]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Paris\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Paris.\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lutetia\n\nThe *Parisii*, a sub-tribe of the Celtic Senones, inhabited the Paris area from around the middle of the 3rd century BC.[24][25] One of the area's major north–south trade routes crossed the Seine on the île de la Cité, which gradually became an important trading centre.[26] The Parisii traded with many river towns (some as far away as the Iberian Peninsula) and minted their own coins.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gold coins minted by the Parisii (1st century BC)\nThe Romans conquered the Paris Basin in 52 BC and began their settlement on Paris's Left Bank.[28] The Roman town was originally called Lutetia (more fully, *Lutetia Parisiorum*, \"Lutetia of the Parisii\", modern French *Lutèce*). It became a prosperous city with a forum, baths, temples, theatres, and an amphitheatre.[29]\n\n\nBy the end of the Western Roman Empire, the town was known as *Parisius*, a Latin name that would later become *Paris* in French.[30] Christianity was introduced in the middle of the 3rd century AD by Saint Denis, the first Bishop of Paris: according to legend, when he refused to renounce his faith before the Roman occupiers, he was beheaded on the hill which became known as *Mons Martyrum* (Latin \"Hill of Martyrs\"), later \"Montmartre\", from where he walked headless to the north of the city; the place where he fell and was buried became an important religious shrine, the Basilica of Saint-Denis, and many French kings are buried there.[31]\n\n\nClovis the Frank, the first king of the Merovingian dynasty, made the city his capital from 508.[32] As the Frankish domination of Gaul began, there was a gradual immigration by the Franks to Paris and the Parisian Francien dialects were born. Fortification of the Île de la Cité failed to avert sacking by Vikings in 845, but Paris's strategic importance—with its bridges preventing ships from passing—was established by successful defence in the Siege of Paris (885–886), for which the then Count of Paris (*comte de Paris*), Odo of France, was elected king of West Francia.[33] From the Capetian dynasty that began with the 987 election of Hugh Capet, Count of Paris and Duke of the Franks (*duc des Francs*), as king of a unified West Francia, Paris gradually became the largest and most prosperous city in France.[31]\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages to Louis XIV[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the Middle Ages, Paris in the 16th century, and Paris in the 17th century\n\n![The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410)](image)The Palais de la Cité and Sainte-Chapelle, viewed from the Left Bank, from the Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry (month of June) (1410)\nBy the end of the 12th century, Paris had become the political, economic, religious, and cultural capital of France.[34] The Palais de la Cité, the royal residence, was located at the western end of the Île de la Cité. In 1163, during the reign of Louis VII, Maurice de Sully, bishop of Paris, undertook the construction of the Notre Dame Cathedral at its eastern extremity.\n\n\nAfter the marshland between the river Seine and its slower 'dead arm' to its north was filled in from around the 10th century,[35] Paris's cultural centre began to move to the Right Bank. In 1137, a new city marketplace (today's Les Halles) replaced the two smaller ones on the Île de la Cité and Place de Grève (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville).[36] The latter location housed the headquarters of Paris's river trade corporation, an organisation that later became, unofficially (although formally in later years), Paris's first municipal government.\n\n\nIn the late 12th century, Philip Augustus extended the Louvre fortress to defend the city against river invasions from the west, gave the city its first walls between 1190 and 1215, rebuilt its bridges to either side of its central island, and paved its main thoroughfares.[37] In 1190, he transformed Paris's former cathedral school into a student-teacher corporation that would become the University of Paris and would draw students from all of Europe.[38][34]\n\n\nWith 200,000 inhabitants in 1328, Paris, then already the capital of France, was the most populous city of Europe. By comparison, London in 1300 had 80,000 inhabitants. By the early fourteenth century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by *merde*, the French word for \"shit\".[39][40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel de Sens (c. 15th–16th), former residence of the Archbishop of Sens\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, Paris was occupied by England-friendly Burgundian forces from 1418, before being occupied outright by the English when Henry V of England entered the French capital in 1420;[41] in spite of a 1429 effort by Joan of Arc to liberate the city,[42] it would remain under English occupation until 1436.\n\n\nIn the late 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a stronghold of the Catholic League, the organisers of 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in which thousands of French Protestants were killed.[43][44] The conflicts ended when pretender to the throne Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain entry to the capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris's first uncovered, sidewalk-lined bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension connecting it to the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. In spite of Henry IV's efforts to improve city circulation, the narrowness of Paris's streets was a contributing factor in his assassination near Les Halles marketplace in 1610.[45]\n\n\nDuring the 17th century, Cardinal Richelieu, chief minister of Louis XIII, was determined to make Paris the most beautiful city in Europe. He built five new bridges, a new chapel for the College of Sorbonne, and a palace for himself, the Palais-Cardinal. After Richelieu's death in 1642, it was renamed the Palais-Royal.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lutetia Parisiorum vulgo Paris, Plan de Paris en 1657, Jan Janssonius\nDue to the Parisian uprisings during the Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court to a new palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and sciences in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate that the city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the *Grands Boulevards*.[47] Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.[48]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the 18th century, Paris during the Second Empire, and Haussmann's renovation of Paris\n\nParis grew in population from about 400,000 in 1640, to 650,000 in 1780.[49] A new boulevard named the Champs-Élysées extended the city west to Étoile,[50] while the working-class neighbourhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine on the eastern side of the city grew increasingly crowded with poor migrant workers from other regions of France.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)The storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, by Jean-Pierre Houël\n![](image)The Panthéon, a major landmark on the Rive Gauche, was completed in 1790.\nParis was the centre of an explosion of philosophic and scientific activity, known as the Age of Enlightenment. Diderot and d'Alembert published their *Encyclopédie* in 1751, and the Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot air balloon on 21 November 1783. Paris was the financial capital of continental Europe, and the primary European centre of book publishing, fashion and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods.[52]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1789, Paris became the centre stage of the French Revolution. On 14 July, a mob seized the arsenal at the Invalides, acquiring thousands of guns, and stormed the Bastille, which was a principal symbol of royal authority. The first independent Paris Commune, or city council, met in the *Hôtel de Ville* and elected a Mayor, the astronomer Jean Sylvain Bailly, on 15 July.[53]\n\n\nLouis XVI and the royal family were brought to Paris and incarcerated in the Tuileries Palace. In 1793, as the revolution turned increasingly radical, the king, queen and mayor were beheaded by guillotine in the Reign of Terror, along with more than 16,000 others throughout France.[54] The property of the aristocracy and the church was nationalised, and the city's churches were closed, sold or demolished.[55] A succession of revolutionary factions ruled Paris until 9 November 1799 (*coup d'état du 18 brumaire*), when Napoleon Bonaparte seized power as First Consul.[56]\n\n\nThe population of Paris had dropped by 100,000 during the Revolution, but after 1799 it surged with 160,000 new residents, reaching 660,000 by 1815.[57] Napoleon replaced the elected government of Paris with a prefect that reported directly to him. He began erecting monuments to military glory, including the Arc de Triomphe, and improved the neglected infrastructure of the city with new fountains, the Canal de l'Ourcq, Père Lachaise Cemetery and the city's first metal bridge, the Pont des Arts.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Eiffel Tower, under construction in November 1888, startled Parisians—and the world—with its modernity.\nDuring the Restoration, the bridges and squares of Paris were returned to their pre-Revolution names; the July Revolution in 1830 (commemorated by the July Column on the Place de la Bastille) brought to power a constitutional monarch, Louis Philippe I. The first railway line to Paris opened in 1837, beginning a new period of massive migration from the provinces to the city.[57] In 1848, Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris. His successor, Napoleon III, alongside the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a huge public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes.[58] In 1860, Napoleon III annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.[58]\n\n\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), Paris was besieged by the Prussian Army. Following several months of blockade, hunger, and then bombardment by the Prussians, the city was forced to surrender on 28 January 1871. After seizing power in Paris on 28 March, a revolutionary government known as the Paris Commune held power for two months, before being harshly suppressed by the French army during the \"Bloody Week\" at the end of May 1871.[59]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Paris hosted two major international expositions: the 1889 Universal Exposition, which featured the new Eiffel Tower, was held to mark the centennial of the French Revolution; and the 1900 Universal Exposition gave Paris the Pont Alexandre III, the Grand Palais, the Petit Palais and the first Paris Métro line.[60] Paris became the laboratory of Naturalism (Émile Zola) and Symbolism (Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine), and of Impressionism in art (Courbet, Manet, Monet, Renoir).[61]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Paris in the Belle Époque, Paris during the First World War, Paris between the Wars (1919–1939), Paris in World War II, and History of Paris (1946–2000)\n\nBy 1901, the population of Paris had grown to about 2,715,000.[62] At the beginning of the century, artists from around the world including Pablo Picasso, Modigliani, and Henri Matisse made Paris their home. It was the birthplace of Fauvism, Cubism and abstract art,[63][64] and authors such as Marcel Proust were exploring new approaches to literature.[65]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Paris sometimes found itself on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns.[66] In the years after the war, known as *Les Années Folles*, Paris continued to be a mecca for writers, musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Eva Kotchever, Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin, Sidney Bechet[67] and Salvador Dalí.[68]\n\n\nIn the years after the peace conference, the city was also home to growing numbers of students and activists from French colonies and other Asian and African countries, who later became leaders of their countries, such as Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai and Léopold Sédar Senghor.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Charles de Gaulle on the Champs-Élysées celebrating the liberation of Paris, 26 August 1944\nOn 14 June 1940, the German army marched into Paris, which had been declared an \"open city\".[70] On 16–17 July 1942, following German orders, the French police and gendarmes arrested 12,884 Jews, including 4,115 children, and confined them during five days at the *Vel d'Hiv* (*Vélodrome d'Hiver*), from which they were transported by train to the extermination camp at Auschwitz. None of the children came back.[71][72] On 25 August 1944, the city was liberated by the French 2nd Armoured Division and the 4th Infantry Division of the United States Army. General Charles de Gaulle led a huge and emotional crowd down the Champs Élysées towards Notre Dame de Paris, and made a rousing speech from the Hôtel de Ville.[73]\n\n\nIn the 1950s and the 1960s, Paris became one front of the Algerian War for independence; in August 1961, the pro-independence FLN targeted and killed 11 Paris policemen, leading to the imposition of a curfew on Muslims of Algeria (who, at that time, were French citizens). On 17 October 1961, an unauthorised but peaceful protest demonstration of Algerians against the curfew led to violent confrontations between the police and demonstrators, in which at least 40 people were killed. The anti-independence Organisation armée secrète (OAS) carried out a series of bombings in Paris throughout 1961 and 1962.[74][75]\n\n\nIn May 1968, protesting students occupied the Sorbonne and put up barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority. The May 1968 events in France resulted in the break-up of the University of Paris into 13 independent campuses.[76] In 1975, the National Assembly changed the status of Paris to that of other French cities and, on 25 March 1977, Jacques Chirac became the first elected mayor of Paris since 1793.[77] The Tour Maine-Montparnasse, the tallest building in the city at 57 storeys and 210 m (689 ft) high, was built between 1969 and 1973. It was highly controversial, and it remains the only building in the centre of the city over 32 storeys high.[78] The population of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families moved to the suburbs.[79] A suburban railway network, the RER (Réseau Express Régional), was built to complement the Métro; the Périphérique expressway encircling the city, was completed in 1973.[80]\n\n\nMost of the postwar presidents of the Fifth Republic wanted to leave their own monuments in Paris; President Georges Pompidou started the Centre Georges Pompidou (1977), Valéry Giscard d'Estaing began the Musée d'Orsay (1986); President François Mitterrand had the Opéra Bastille built (1985–1989), the new site of the *Bibliothèque nationale de France* (1996), the Arche de la Défense (1985–1989) in La Défense, as well as the Louvre Pyramid with its underground courtyard (1983–1989); Jacques Chirac (2006), the Musée du quai Branly.[81]\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, the population of Paris began to increase slowly again, as more young people moved into the city. It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delanoë became the first socialist mayor. He was re-elected in March 2008.[82] In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic, he introduced the Vélib', a system which rents bicycles. Bertrand Delanoë also transformed a section of the highway along the Left Bank of the Seine into an urban promenade and park, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine, which he inaugurated in June 2013.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Demonstrators at the Place de la République, Paris, 11 January 2015, during the Republican marches after the *Charlie Hebdo* shooting\nIn 2007, President Nicolas Sarkozy launched the Grand Paris project, to integrate Paris more closely with the towns in the region around it. After many modifications, the new area, named the Metropolis of Grand Paris, with a population of 6.7 million, was created on 1 January 2016.[84] In 2011, the City of Paris and the national government approved the plans for the Grand Paris Express, totalling 205 km (127 mi) of automated metro lines to connect Paris, the innermost three departments around Paris, airports and high-speed rail (TGV) stations, at an estimated cost of €35 billion.[85] The system is scheduled to be completed by 2030.[86]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed attacks across the Paris region.[87][88] 1.5 million people marched in Paris in a show of solidarity against terrorism and in support of freedom of speech.[89] In November of the same year, terrorist attacks, claimed by ISIL,[90] killed 130 people and injured more than 350.[91]\n\n\nOn 22 April 2016, the Paris Agreement was signed by 196 nations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in an aim to limit the effects of climate change below 2 °C.[92]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Paris\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Paris, captured by ESA's Sentinel-2 mission\nParis is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (*La Manche*) is about 233 mi (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.[93] Overall, the city is relatively flat, and the lowest point is 35 m (115 ft) above sea level. Paris has several prominent hills, the highest of which is Montmartre at 130 m (427 ft).[94]\n\n\nExcluding the outlying parks of Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, Paris covers an oval measuring about 87 km2 (34 sq mi) in area, enclosed by the 35 km (22 mi) ring road, the Boulevard Périphérique.[95] The city's last major annexation of outlying territories in 1860 not only gave it its modern form but also created the 20 clockwise-spiralling arrondissements (municipal boroughs). From the 1860 area of 78 km2 (30 sq mi), the city limits were expanded marginally to 86.9 km2 (33.6 sq mi) in the 1920s. In 1929, the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes forest parks were officially annexed to the city, bringing its area to about 105 km2 (41 sq mi).[96] The metropolitan area is 2,300 km2 (890 sq mi).[93]\n\n\nMeasured from the 'point zero' in front of its Notre-Dame cathedral, Paris by road is 450 km (280 mi) southeast of London, 287 km (178 mi) south of Calais, 305 km (190 mi) southwest of Brussels, 774 km (481 mi) north of Marseille, 385 km (239 mi) northeast of Nantes, and 135 km (84 mi) southeast of Rouen.[97]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Paris\n\n![](image)Autumn in Paris\nParis has a typical Western European oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*), which is affected by the North Atlantic Current. The overall climate throughout the year is mild and moderately wet.[98] Summer days are usually warm and pleasant with average temperatures between 15 and 25 °C (59 and 77 °F), and a fair amount of sunshine.[99] Each year, however, there are a few days when the temperature rises above 32 °C (90 °F). Longer periods of more intense heat sometimes occur, such as the heat wave of 2003 when temperatures exceeded 30 °C (86 °F) for weeks, reached 40 °C (104 °F) on some days and rarely cooled down at night.[100] Spring and autumn have, on average, mild days and cool nights but are changing and unstable. Surprisingly warm or cool weather occurs frequently in both seasons.[101] In winter, sunshine is scarce; days are cool, and nights are cold but generally above freezing with low temperatures around 3 °C (37 °F).[102] Light night frosts are however quite common, but the temperature seldom dips below −5 °C (23 °F). The city sometimes sees light snow or flurries with or without accumulation.[103]\n\n\nParis has an average annual precipitation of 641 mm (25.2 in), and experiences light rainfall distributed evenly throughout the year. However, the city is known for intermittent, abrupt, heavy showers. The highest recorded temperature was 42.6 °C (108.7 °F) on 25 July 2019,[104] and the lowest was −23.9 °C (−11.0 °F) on 10 December 1879.[105]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Paris (Parc Montsouris), elevation: 75 m (246 ft), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1872–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 37.6(99.7)\n | 42.6(108.7)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 36.2(97.2)\n | 28.9(84.0)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 42.6(108.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 7.9(46.2)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 9.9(49.8)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −14.6(5.7)\n | −14.7(5.5)\n | −9.1(15.6)\n | −3.5(25.7)\n | −0.1(31.8)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | −14.0(6.8)\n | −23.9(−11.0)\n | −23.9(−11.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 47.6(1.87)\n | 41.8(1.65)\n | 45.2(1.78)\n | 45.8(1.80)\n | 69.0(2.72)\n | 51.3(2.02)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 58.0(2.28)\n | 44.7(1.76)\n | 55.2(2.17)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 62.0(2.44)\n | 634.3(24.97)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 9.9\n | 9.1\n | 9.5\n | 8.6\n | 9.2\n | 8.3\n | 7.4\n | 8.1\n | 7.5\n | 9.5\n | 10.4\n | 11.4\n | 108.9\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 3.0\n | 3.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.7\n | 2.1\n | 11.9\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 83\n | 78\n | 73\n | 69\n | 70\n | 69\n | 68\n | 71\n | 76\n | 82\n | 84\n | 84\n | 76\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 59.0\n | 83.7\n | 134.9\n | 177.3\n | 201.0\n | 203.5\n | 222.4\n | 215.3\n | 174.7\n | 118.6\n | 69.8\n | 56.9\n | 1,717\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 22\n | 29\n | 37\n | 43\n | 43\n | 42\n | 46\n | 48\n | 46\n | 35\n | 25\n | 22\n | 37\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 7\n | 7\n | 6\n | 4\n | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: Meteo France (snow days 1981–2010),[106] Infoclimat.fr (relative humidity 1961–1990)[107] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (percent sunshine and UV Index)[108] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administration of Paris\n\n### City government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Arrondissements of Paris and List of mayors of Paris\n\n![](image)A map of the arrondissements of Paris\nFor almost all of its long history, except for a few brief periods, Paris was governed directly by representatives of the king, emperor, or president of France. The city was not granted municipal autonomy by the National Assembly until 1974.[109] The first modern elected mayor of Paris was Jacques Chirac, elected 20 March 1977, becoming the city's first mayor since 1871 and only the fourth since 1794. The current mayor is Anne Hidalgo, a socialist, first elected 5 April 2014[110] and re-elected 28 June 2020.[111]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel de Ville, or city hall\nThe mayor of Paris is elected indirectly by Paris voters; the voters of each of the city's 20 arrondissements elect members to the *Conseil de Paris* (Council of Paris), which subsequently elects the mayor. The council is composed of 163 members, with each arrondissement allocated a number of seats dependent upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements to 34 members for the most populated. The council is elected using closed list proportional representation in a two-round system. Party lists winning an absolute majority in the first round – or at least a plurality in the second round – automatically win half the seats of an arrondissement. The remaining half of seats are distributed proportionally to all lists which win at least 5% of the vote using the highest averages method.[112] This ensures that the winning party or coalition always wins a majority of the seats, even if they do not win an absolute majority of the vote.[113]\n\n\nPrior to the 2020 Paris municipal election, each of Paris's 20 arrondissements had its own town hall and a directly elected council (*conseil d'arrondissement*), which, in turn, elects an arrondissement mayor.[114] The council of each arrondissement is composed of members of the Conseil de Paris and also members who serve only on the council of the arrondissement. The number of deputy mayors in each arrondissement varies depending upon its population. As of 1996, there were a total of 20 arrondissement mayors and 120 deputy mayors.[109] The creation of Paris Centre, a unified administrative division with a single mayor covering the first four arrondissements, took effect with the said 2020 election; the other 16 arrondissements continue to have their own mayors.[115]\n\n\n\n### Métropole du Grand Paris[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Greater Paris Metropolis and its governing territories\nThe Métropole du Grand Paris, or simply Grand Paris, formally came into existence on 1 January 2016.[116] It is an administrative structure for co-operation between the City of Paris and its nearest suburbs. It includes the City of Paris, plus the communes of the three departments of the inner suburbs (Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne), plus seven communes in the outer suburbs, including Argenteuil in Val d'Oise and Paray-Vieille-Poste in Essonne, which were added to include the major airports of Paris. The Metropole covers 814 km2 (314 sq mi) and has a population of 6.945 million persons.[117][118]\n\n\nThe new structure is administered by a Metropolitan Council of 210 members, not directly elected, but chosen by the councils of the member Communes. By 2020 its basic competencies will include urban planning, housing and protection of the environment.[116][118] The first president of the metropolitan council, Patrick Ollier, was elected on 22 January 2016. Though the Metropole has a population of nearly seven million people and accounts for 25 percent of the GDP of France, it has a very small budget: just 65 million Euros, compared with eight billion Euros for the City of Paris.[119]\n\n\n\n### Regional government[edit]\n\n\nThe Region of Île de France, including Paris and its surrounding communities, is governed by the Regional Council, composed of 209 members representing its different communes. On 15 December 2015, a list of candidates of the Union of the Right, a coalition of centrist and right-wing parties, led by Valérie Pécresse, narrowly won the regional election, defeating a coalition of Socialists and ecologists. The Socialists had governed the region for seventeen years. The regional council has 121 members from the Union of the Right, 66 from the Union of the Left and 22 from the extreme right National Front.[120]\n\n\n\n### National government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Élysée Palace, official residence of the President of France\nAs the capital of France, Paris is the seat of France's national government. For the executive, the two chief officers each have their own official residences, which also serve as their offices. The President of the French Republic resides at the Élysée Palace,[121] while the Prime Minister's seat is at the Hôtel Matignon.[122][123] Government ministries are located in various parts of the city, many near the Hôtel Matignon.[124]\n\n\nBoth houses of the French Parliament are located on the Rive Gauche. The upper house, the Senate, meets in the Palais du Luxembourg, while the more important lower house, the National Assembly, meets in the Palais Bourbon. The President of the Senate, the second-highest public official in France (the President of the Republic being the sole superior), resides in the Petit Luxembourg, a smaller palace annexe to the Palais du Luxembourg.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palais-Royal, residence of the Conseil d'État\nFrance's highest courts are located in Paris. The Court of Cassation, the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the Palais de Justice on the *Île de la Cité*,[126] while the Conseil d'État, which provides legal advice to the executive and acts as the highest court in the administrative order, judging litigation against public bodies, is located in the Palais-Royal in the 1st arrondissement.[127] The Constitutional Council, an advisory body with ultimate authority on the constitutionality of laws and government decrees, also meets in the Montpensier wing of the Palais Royal.[128]\n\n\nParis and its region host the headquarters of several international organisations including UNESCO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Paris Club, the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie*, the European Union Institute for Security Studies, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, the International Exhibition Bureau, and the International Federation for Human Rights.\n\n\n\n### Police force[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police (Gendarmerie) motorcyclists\nThe security of Paris is mainly the responsibility of the Prefecture of Police of Paris, a subdivision of the Ministry of the Interior. It supervises the units of the National Police who patrol the city and the three neighbouring departments. It is also responsible for providing emergency services, including the Paris Fire Brigade. Its headquarters is on Place Louis Lépine on the Île de la Cité.[129]\n\n\nThere are 43,800 officers under the prefecture, and a fleet of more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters.[129] The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS). Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in the centre of the city when there are demonstrations and public events. The police are supported by the National Gendarmerie, a branch of the French Armed Forces, though their police operations now are supervised by the Ministry of the Interior.[130]\n\n\nCrime in Paris is similar to that in most large cities. Violent crime is relatively rare in the city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.[131]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Paris as seen from the Eiffel Tower in a full 360-degree view (river flowing from north-east to south-west, right to left)\n\n### Urbanism and architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Paris, Haussmann's renovation of Paris, Religious buildings in Paris, and List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region\n\n![](image)Rue de Rivoli\n![](image)Place des Vosges\nParis is one of the few world capitals that has rarely seen destruction by catastrophe or war. For this, even its earliest history is still visible in its streetmap, and centuries of rulers adding their respective architectural marks on the capital has resulted in an accumulated wealth of history-rich monuments and buildings whose beauty played a large part in giving the city the reputation it has today.[132] At its origin, before the Middle Ages, the city was composed of several islands and sandbanks in a bend of the Seine; of those, two remain today: Île Saint-Louis and the Île de la Cité. A third one is the 1827 artificially created Île aux Cygnes.\n\n\nModern Paris owes much of its downtown plan and architectural harmony to Napoleon III and his Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. Between 1853 and 1870 they rebuilt the city centre, created the wide downtown boulevards and squares where the boulevards intersected, imposed standard facades along the boulevards, and required that the facades be built of the distinctive cream-grey \"Paris stone\". They also built the major parks around the city centre.[133] The high residential population of its city centre also makes it much different from most other western major cities.[134]\n\n\nParis's urbanism laws have been under strict control since the early 17th century,[135] particularly where street-front alignment, building height and building distribution is concerned.[135] The 210 m (690 ft) Tour Montparnasse was both Paris's and France's tallest building since 1973,[136] but this record has been held by the La Défense quarter Tour First tower in Courbevoie since its 2011 construction.\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front de Seine development along the river Seine\nThe most expensive residential street in Paris in 2018 by average price per square metre was Avenue Montaigne, at 22,372 euros per square metre.[137] The total number of residences in the City of Paris in 2011 was 1,356,074, up from a former high of 1,334,815 in 2006. Among these, 1,165,541 (85.9 percent) were main residences, 91,835 (6.8 percent) were secondary residences, and the remaining 7.3 percent were empty (down from 9.2 percent in 2006).[138]\n\n\nSixty-two percent of its buildings date from 1949 and before, 20 percent were built between 1949 and 1974, and only 18 percent of the buildings remaining were built after that date.[139] Two-thirds of the city's 1.3 million residences are studio and two-room apartments. Paris averages 1.9 people per residence, a number that has remained constant since the 1980s, but it is much less than Île-de-France's 2.33 person-per-residence average. Only 33 percent of principal residence Parisians own their habitation (against 47 percent for the entire Île-de-France): the major part of the city's population is a rent-paying one.[139] Social or public housing represented 19.9 percent of the city's total residences in 2017. Its distribution varies widely throughout the city, from 2.6 percent of the housing in the wealthy 7th arrondissement, to 39.9 percent in the 19th arrondissement.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, a Paris NGO conducted its annual citywide count of homeless persons. They counted 3,641 homeless persons in Paris, of whom twelve percent were women. More than half had been homeless for more than a year. 2,885 were living in the streets or parks, 298 in train and metro stations, and 756 in other forms of temporary shelter. This was an increase of 588 persons since 2018.[141]\n\n\n\n### Suburbs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Western Paris in 2016, as photographed by a SkySat satellite\n![](image)West of Paris seen from Tour Montparnasse in 2019\nAside from the 20th-century addition of the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes and the Paris heliport, Paris's administrative limits have remained unchanged since 1860. A greater administrative Seine department had been governing Paris and its suburbs since its creation in 1790, but the rising suburban population had made it difficult to maintain as a unique entity. To address this problem, the parent \"District de la région parisienne\" ('district of the Paris region') was reorganised into several new departments from 1968: Paris became a department in itself, and the administration of its suburbs was divided between the three new departments surrounding it. The district of the Paris region was renamed \"Île-de-France\" in 1977, but this abbreviated \"Paris region\" name is still commonly used today to describe the Île-de-France, and as a vague reference to the entire Paris agglomeration.[142] Long-intended measures to unite Paris with its suburbs began on 1 January 2016, when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.[116]\n\n\nParis's disconnect with its suburbs, its lack of suburban transportation, in particular, became all too apparent with the Paris agglomeration's growth. Paul Delouvrier promised to resolve the Paris-suburbs *mésentente* when he became head of the Paris region in 1961:[143] two of his most ambitious projects for the Region were the construction of five suburban \"villes nouvelles\" (\"new cities\")[144] and the RER commuter train network.[145] Many other suburban residential districts (*grands ensembles*) were built between the 1960s and 1970s to provide a low-cost solution for a rapidly expanding population:[146] These districts were socially mixed at first,[147] but few residents actually owned their homes (the growing economy made these accessible to the middle classes only from the 1970s).[148] Their poor construction quality and their haphazard insertion into existing urban growth contributed to their desertion by those able to move elsewhere and their repopulation by those with more limited possibilities.[148]\n\n\nThese areas, *quartiers sensibles* (\"sensitive quarters\"), are in northern and eastern Paris, namely around its Goutte d'Or and Belleville neighbourhoods. To the north of the city, they are grouped mainly in the Seine-Saint-Denis department, and to a lesser extreme to the east in the Val-d'Oise department. Other difficult areas are located in the Seine valley, in Évry et Corbeil-Essonnes (Essonne), in Mureaux, Mantes-la-Jolie (Yvelines), and scattered among social housing districts created by Delouvrier's 1961 \"ville nouvelle\" political initiative.[149]\n\n\nThe Paris agglomeration's urban sociology is basically that of 19th-century Paris: the wealthy live in the west and southwest, and the middle-to-working classes are in the north and east. The remaining areas are mostly middle-class dotted with wealthy islands located there due to reasons of historical importance, namely Saint-Maur-des-Fossés to the east and Enghien-les-Bains to the north of Paris.[150]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Paris\n\n![](image)City of Paris population pyramid in 2022\n\n\n| 2019 Census Paris Region |\n| --- |\n| (*Île-de-France*)[151][152] |\n| \n\n|  Country/territoryof birth |  Population |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![France](image) Metropolitan France |  9,215,134 |\n| ![Algeria](image) Algeria |  330,935 |\n| ![Morocco](image) Morocco |  253,518 |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portugal |  234,399 |\n| ![Tunisia](image) Tunisia |  127,827 |\n| ![](image) Guadeloupe |  81,269 |\n| ![](image) Martinique |  75,959 |\n| ![China](image) China |  71,500 |\n| ![Turkey](image) Turkey |  67,982 |\n| ![Mali](image) Mali |  66,085 |\n| ![Ivory Coast](image) Côte d'Ivoire |  63,810 |\n| ![Senegal](image) Senegal |  60,124 |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy |  58,141 |\n| ![Romania](image) Romania |  53,848 |\n| ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Democratic Republic of Congo |  52,449 |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain |  45,828 |\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) Sri Lanka |  45,786 |\n| ![Cameroon](image) Cameroon |  45,370 |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Other countries/territories |\n| --- |\n| ![Republic of the Congo](image) Republic of the Congo |  38,651 |\n| ![Haiti](image) Haiti |  36,685 |\n| ![Poland](image) Poland |  35,871 |\n| ![Vietnam](image) Vietnam |  35,251 |\n| ![Cambodia](image) Cambodia |  30,321 |\n| ![](image) Réunion |  30,077 |\n| ![India](image) India |  29,623 |\n| ![Serbia](image) Serbia |  25,632 |\n| ![Lebanon](image) Lebanon |  21,066 |\n| ![Madagascar](image) Madagascar |  21,002 |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany |  20,523 |\n| ![Pakistan](image) Pakistan |  20,178 |\n| ![Russia](image) Russia |  19,019 |\n| ![Mauritius](image) Mauritius |  18,840 |\n| ![Guinea](image) Guinea |  18,709 |\n| ![Brazil](image) Brazil |  17,887 |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) United Kingdom |  17,789 |\n| ![United States](image) United States |  17,583 |\n| ![United Nations](image) Other countries and territories |  857,720 |\n\n |\n\n\nThe official estimated population of the City of Paris on 1 January 1, 2023 was 2,102,650, down from 2,165,423 on January 1, 2022, according to the INSEE, the official French statistical agency. According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\nParis is the fourth largest municipality in the European Union, following Berlin, Madrid and Rome. Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\nParis is the core of a built-up area that extends well beyond its limits: commonly referred to as the *agglomération Parisienne*, and statistically as a *unité urbaine* (a measure of urban area), the Paris agglomeration's population of 10,785,092 in 2017[161] made it the largest urban area in the European Union.[162] City-influenced commuter activity reaches well beyond even this in a statistical *aire d'attraction* de Paris (\"functional area\", a statistical method comparable to a metropolitan area[163]), that had a population of 13,024,518 in 2017,[164] 19.6% of the population of France,[165] and the largest metropolitan area in the Eurozone.[162]\n\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 people per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over 10,000 people per square kilometre, ranking among the 10 most densely populated areas of the EU.[166][*verification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nUnder French law, people born in foreign countries with no French citizenship at birth are defined as immigrants. According to the 2012 census, 135,853 residents of the City of Paris were immigrants from Europe, 112,369 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 70,852 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 5,059 from Turkey, 91,297 from Asia (outside Turkey), 38,858 from the Americas, and 1,365 from the South Pacific.[167]\n\n\nIn the Paris Region, 590,504 residents were immigrants from Europe, 627,078 were immigrants from the Maghreb, 435,339 from sub-Saharan Africa and Egypt, 69,338 from Turkey, 322,330 from Asia (outside Turkey), 113,363 from the Americas, and 2,261 from the South Pacific.[168]\n\n\nIn 2012, there were 8,810 British citizens and 10,019 United States citizens living in the City of Paris (Ville de Paris) and 20,466 British citizens and 16,408 United States citizens living in the entire Paris Region (Île-de-France).[169][170]\n\n\nIn 2020–2021, about 6 million people, or 41% of the population of the Paris Region, were either immigrants (21%) or had at least one immigrant parent (20%); these figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.[171]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religious buildings in Paris\n\n![](image)Sacré-Cœur in Montmartre\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Paris was the largest Catholic city in the world.[172] French census data does not contain information about religious affiliation.[173] According to a 2011 survey by the Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), a French public opinion research organisation, 61 percent of residents of the Paris Region (Île-de-France) identified themselves as Roman Catholic. In the same survey, 7 percent of residents identified themselves as Muslims, 4 percent as Protestants, 2 percent as Jewish and 25 percent as without religion.\n\n\nAccording to the INSEE, between 4 and 5 million French residents were born or had at least one parent born in a predominantly Muslim country, particularly Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. An IFOP survey in 2008 reported that, of immigrants from these predominantly Muslim countries, 25 percent went to the mosque regularly; 41 percent practised the religion, and 34 percent were believers but did not practice the religion.[174][175] In 2012 and 2013, it was estimated that there were almost 500,000 Muslims in the City of Paris, 1.5 million Muslims in the Île-de-France region and 4 to 5 million Muslims in France.[176][177]\n\n\nThe Jewish population of the Paris Region was estimated in 2014 to be 282,000, the largest concentration of Jews in the world outside of Israel and the United States.[178]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Paris\n\n![](image)La Défense, the largest dedicated business district in Europe[179]\n![](image)The headquarters of BNP Paribas, the largest banking group in Europe, in the Boulevard des Italiens[180]\n![](image)Axa headquarters at 25 Avenue Matignon\n![](image)Crédit Agricole headquarters in Montrouge[181]\nThe economy of the City of Paris is based largely on services and commerce; of the 390,480 enterprises in the city, 80.6 percent are engaged in commerce, transportation, and diverse services, 6.5 percent in construction, and just 3.8 percent in industry.[182] The story is similar in the Paris Region (Île-de-France): 76.7 percent of enterprises are engaged in commerce and services, and 3.4 percent in industry.[183]\n\n\nAt the 2012 census, 59.5% of jobs in the Paris Region were in market services (12.0% in wholesale and retail trade, 9.7% in professional, scientific, and technical services, 6.5% in information and communication, 6.5% in transportation and warehousing, 5.9% in finance and insurance, 5.8% in administrative and support services, 4.6% in accommodation and food services, and 8.5% in various other market services), 26.9% in non-market services (10.4% in human health and social work activities, 9.6% in public administration and defence, and 6.9% in education), 8.2% in manufacturing and utilities (6.6% in manufacturing and 1.5% in utilities), 5.2% in construction, and 0.2% in agriculture.[184][185]\n\n\nThe Paris Region had 5.4 million salaried employees in 2010, of whom 2.2 million were concentrated in 39 *pôles d'emplois* or business districts. The largest of these, in terms of number of employees, is known in French as the QCA, or *quartier central des affaires*; in 2010, it was the workplace of 500,000 salaried employees, about 30 percent of the salaried employees in Paris and 10 percent of those in the Île-de-France. The largest sectors of activity in the central business district were finance and insurance (16 percent of employees in the district) and business services (15 percent). The district also includes a large concentration of department stores, shopping areas, hotels and restaurants, as well a government offices and ministries.[186] The second-largest business district in terms of employment is La Défense, just west of the city. In 2010, it was the workplace of 144,600 employees, of whom 38 percent worked in finance and insurance, 16 percent in business support services. Two other important districts, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are extensions of the Paris business district and of La Défense. Another district, including Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and the southern part of the 15th arrondissement, is a centre of activity for the media and information technology.[186]\n\n\nThe top French companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 for 2021 all have their headquarters in the Paris Region; six in the central business district of the City of Paris; and four close to the city in the Hauts-de-Seine Department, three in La Défense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt. Some companies, like Société Générale, have offices in both Paris and La Défense. The Paris Region is France's leading region for economic activity, with a GDP of €742 billion and €59,400 per capita[187] or around 1/3 of the economy of France in 2019.[187]: 12 In 2021, its GDP ranked first among the metropolitan regions of the EU and its per-capita GDP PPP was the 8th highest.[188][189][190] While the Paris region's population accounted for 18.8 percent of metropolitan France in 2019,[191] the Paris region's GDP accounted for 32 percent of metropolitan France's GDP.[192][193]\n\n\nThe Paris Region economy has gradually shifted from industry to high-value-added service industries (finance, IT services) and high-tech manufacturing (electronics, optics, aerospace, etc.).[194] The Paris region's most intense economic activity through the central Hauts-de-Seine department and suburban La Défense business district places Paris's economic centre to the west of the city, in a triangle between the *Opéra Garnier*, *La Défense* and the *Val de Seine*.[194] While the Paris economy is dominated by services, and employment in manufacturing sector has declined sharply, the region remains an important manufacturing centre, particularly for aeronautics, automobiles, and \"eco\" industries.[194]\n\n\nIn the 2017 worldwide cost of living survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, based on a survey made in September 2016, Paris ranked as the seventh most expensive city in the world, and the second most expensive in Europe, after Zurich.[195] In 2018, Paris was the most expensive city in the world with Singapore and Hong Kong.[196] Station F is a business incubator for startups, noted as the world's largest startup facility.[197]\n\n\n\n### Employment and income[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Median income in Paris and its nearest departments in 2018 (high income in red, low income in yellow)\nThe majority of Paris's salaried employees fill 370,000 businesses services jobs, concentrated in the north-western 8th, 16th and 17th arrondissements.[198] Paris's financial service companies are concentrated in the central-western 8th and 9th arrondissement banking and insurance district.[198] Paris's department store district in the 1st, 6th, 8th and 9th arrondissements employ ten percent of mostly female Paris workers, with 100,000 of these registered in the retail trade.[198] Fourteen percent of Parisians work in hotels and restaurants and other services to individuals.[198] Nineteen percent of Paris employees work for the State in either administration or education. The majority of Paris's healthcare and social workers work at the hospitals and social housing concentrated in the peripheral 13th, 14th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements.[198] Outside Paris, the western Hauts-de-Seine department La Défense district specialising in finance, insurance and scientific research district, employs 144,600,[194] and the north-eastern Seine-Saint-Denis audiovisual sector has 200 media firms and 10 major film studios.[194]\n\n\nParis's manufacturing is mostly focused in its suburbs, and the city itself has only around 75,000 manufacturing workers, most of which are in the textile, clothing, leather goods, and shoe trades.[194] The Paris region's 800 aerospace companies employed 100,000.[194] Four hundred automobile industry companies employ another 100,000 workers: many of these are centred in the Yvelines department around the Renault and PSA-Citroën plants (this department alone employs 33,000),[194] but the industry as a whole suffered a major loss with the 2014 closing of a major Aulnay-sous-Bois Citroën assembly plant.[194] The southern Essonne department specialises in science and technology,[194] and the south-eastern Val-de-Marne, with its wholesale Rungis food market, specialises in food processing and beverages.[194] The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers.[194]\n\n\nIncomes are higher in the Western part of the city and in the western suburbs than in the northern and eastern parts of the urban area.[199] While Paris has some of the richest neighbourhoods in France, it also has some of the poorest, mostly on the eastern side of the city. In 2012, 14 percent of households in the city earned less than €977 per month, the official poverty line. Twenty-five percent of residents in the 19th arrondissement lived below the poverty line; in the city's wealthiest neighbourhood, the 7th arrondissement, 7 percent lived below the poverty line.[200] The unemployment rate in Paris in the 4th trimester of 2021 was six percent, compared with 7.4 percent in the whole of France. This was the lowest rate in thirteen years.[201][202]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Paris\n\nFurther information: Landmarks in Paris, Historical quarters of Paris, and List of tourist attractions in Paris\n\n![](image)Louvre, the most-visited art museum in the world\nTourism continued to recover in the Paris region in 2022, increasing to 44 million visitors, an increase of 95 percent over 2021, but still 13 percent lower than in 2019.[203]\n\n\nGreater Paris, comprising Paris and its three surrounding departments, received a record 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel arrivals.[204] These included 12.2 million French visitors. Of the foreign visitors, the greatest number came from the United States (2.6 million), United Kingdom (1.2 million), Germany (981 thousand) and China (711 thousand).[204]\n\n\nIn 2018, measured by the Euromonitor Global Cities Destination Index, Paris was the second-busiest airline destination in the world, with 19.10 million visitors, behind Bangkok (22.78 million) but ahead of London (19.09 million).[205] According to the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, 393,008 workers in Greater Paris, or 12.4 percent of the total workforce, are engaged in tourism-related sectors such as hotels, catering, transport and leisure.[206]\n\n\nThe city's top cultural attractions in 2022 were the Louvre Museum (7.7 million visitors), the Eiffel Tower (5.8 million visitors), the Musée d'Orsay (3.27 million visitors) and the Centre Pompidou (3 million visitors).[203]\n\n\nIn 2019, Greater Paris had 2,056 hotels, including 94 five-star hotels, with a total of 121,646 rooms.[204] Also in 2019, in addition to the hotels, Greater Paris had 60,000 homes registered with Airbnb.[204] Under French law, renters of these units must pay the Paris tourism tax. The company paid the city government 7.3 million euros in 2016.[207][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nA minuscule fraction of foreign visitors suffer from Paris syndrome when their experiences do not meet expectations.[208]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Painting and sculpture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Art in Paris\n\n![](image)Auguste Renoir, *Bal du moulin de la Galette*, 1876, oil on canvas, 131 cm × 175 cm (52 in × 69 in), Musée d'Orsay\nFor centuries, Paris has attracted artists from around the world. As a result, Paris has acquired a reputation as the \"City of Art\".[209] Italian artists were a profound influence on the development of art in Paris in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly in sculpture and reliefs. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during the French Baroque and Classicism era. Sculptors such as Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in 17th-century France. Pierre Mignard became the first painter to King Louis XIV during this period. In 1648, the *Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture* (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) was established to accommodate for the dramatic interest in art in the capital. This served as France's top art school until 1793.[210]\n\n\nParis was in its artistic prime in the 19th century and early 20th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and others. Paris was central to the development of Romanticism in art, with painters such as Géricault.[210] Impressionism, Art Nouveau, Symbolism, Fauvism, Cubism and Art Deco movements all evolved in Paris.[210] In the late 19th century, many artists in the French provinces and worldwide flocked to Paris to exhibit their works in the numerous salons and expositions and make a name for themselves.[211] Artists such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and many others became associated with Paris.\n\n\nThe most prestigious sculptors who made their reputation in Paris in the modern era are Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of *Christ the Redeemer* in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol. The Golden Age of the School of Paris ended between the two world wars.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Paris\n\n![](image)Musée d'Orsay\nThe Louvre received 2,8 million visitors in 2021, up from 2.7 million in 2020,[212] holding its position as first among the most-visited museums. Its treasures include the *Mona Lisa* (*La Joconde*), the *Venus de Milo* statue, and *Liberty Leading the People*. The second-most visited museum in the city in 2021, with 1.5 million visitors, was the Centre Georges Pompidou, also known as Beaubourg, which houses the Musée National d'Art Moderne The third most visited Paris museum in 2021 was the National Museum of Natural History with 1,4 million visitors. It is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections and its Gallery of Evolution. It was followed by the Musée d'Orsay, featuring 19th century art and the French Impressionists, which had one million visitors. Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cité des sciences et de l'industrie, (984,000 visitors in 2020). The other most-visited Paris museums in 2021 were the Fondation Louis Vuitton (691,000), the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac, featuring the indigenous art and cultures of Africa, Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. (616,000); the Musée Carnavalet (History of Paris) (606,000), and the Petit Palais, the art museum of the City of Paris (518,000).[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Musée du quai Branly\nThe Musée de l'Orangerie, near both the Louvre and the Orsay, also exhibits Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, including most of Claude Monet's large *Water Lilies* murals. The Musée national du Moyen Âge, or Cluny Museum, presents Medieval art. The Guimet Museum, or *Musée national des arts asiatiques*, has one of the largest collections of Asian art in Europe. There are also notable museums devoted to individual artists, including the Musée Picasso, the Musée Rodin and the Musée national Eugène Delacroix.\n\n\nThe military history of France is presented by displays at the Musée de l'Armée at Les Invalides. In addition to the national museums, run by the Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Palais de Tokyo, the House of Victor Hugo, the House of Balzac and the Catacombs of Paris.[214] There are also notable private museums. The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne.\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nThe largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern.[215] In the middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique (which still exists), Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre de la Ville).[216] Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Comédie Française (Salle Richelieu)\nTheatre traditionally has occupied a large place in Parisian culture, and many of its most popular actors today are also stars of French television. The oldest and most famous Paris theatre is the Comédie-Française, founded in 1680. Run by the Government of France, it performs mostly French classics at the Salle Richelieu in the Palais-Royal.[217] Other famous theatres include the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe, also a state institution and theatrical landmark; the Théâtre Mogador; and the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Montparnasse.[218]\n\n\nThe music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The *Moulin Rouge* was opened in 1889 and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the *Folies Bergère*. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Dalida, Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland and the Grateful Dead.\n\n\nThe Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include *Le Lido*, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly by visitors to the city.[219]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Writers in Paris\n\n![](image)Victor Hugo\nThe first book printed in France, *Epistolae* (\"Letters\"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was published in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been the centre of the French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, Charles Perrault,[220] several coming from the provinces, as well as the foundation of the Académie française.[221] In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris revolved around the cafés and salons; it was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux and Pierre Beaumarchais.\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, Paris was the home and subject for some of France's greatest writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris.[222] Another of Victor Hugo's works, *Les Misérables*, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s.[223] One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.[224][*verification needed*]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, the Paris literary community was dominated by figures such as Colette, André Gide, François Mauriac, André Malraux, Albert Camus, and, after World War II, by Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. Between the wars it was the home of many important expatriate writers, including Ernest Hemingway, Samuel Beckett, Miguel Ángel Asturias, Alejo Carpentier and, Arturo Uslar Pietri. The winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Literature, Patrick Modiano, based most of his literary work on the depiction of the city during World War II and the 1960s–1970s.[225]\n\n\nParis is a city of books and bookstores. In the 1970s, 80 percent of French-language publishing houses were found in Paris.[226] It is also a city of small bookstores. There are about 150 bookstores in the 5th arrondissement alone, plus another 250 book stalls along the Seine. Small Paris bookstores are protected against competition from discount booksellers by French law; books, even e-books, cannot be discounted more than five percent below their publisher's cover price.[227]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Paris and History of music in Paris\n\n![](image)Olympia, a famous music hall\n![](image)Umm Kulthum checking a banner for her concert in Olympia, 12 November 1967\nIn the late 12th century, a school of polyphony was established at Notre-Dame. Among the Trouvères of northern France, a group of Parisian aristocrats became known for their poetry and songs. Troubadours, from the south of France, were also popular. During the reign of François I, in the Renaissance era, the lute became popular in the French court. The French royal family and courtiers \"disported themselves in masques, ballets, allegorical dances, recitals, and opera and comedy\", and a national musical printing house was established.[210] In the Baroque-era, noted composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, and François Couperin.[210] The *Conservatoire de Musique de Paris* was founded in 1795.[228] By 1870, Paris had become an important centre for symphony, ballet and operatic music.\n\n\nRomantic-era composers (in Paris) include Hector Berlioz, Charles Gounod, Camille Saint-Saëns, Léo Delibes and Jules Massenet, among others.[210] Georges Bizet's *Carmen* premiered 3 March 1875. *Carmen* has since become one of the most popular and frequently-performed operas in the classical canon.[229][230] Among the Impressionist composers who created new works for piano, orchestra, opera, chamber music and other musical forms, stand in particular, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel . Several foreign-born composers, such as Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Jacques Offenbach, Niccolò Paganini, and Igor Stravinsky, established themselves or made significant contributions both with their works and their influence in Paris.\n\n\nBal-musette is a style of French music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s; by 1880 Paris had some 150 dance halls.[231] Patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \"musette\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy) in the cafés and bars of the city. Parisian and Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars,[232] anParis became a major centre for jazz and still attracts jazz musicians from all around the world to its clubs and cafés.[233]\n\n\nParis is the spiritual home of gypsy jazz in particular, and many of the Parisian jazzmen who developed in the first half of the 20th century began by playing Bal-musette in the city.[232] Django Reinhardt rose to fame in Paris, having moved to the 18th arrondissement in a caravan as a young boy, and performed with violinist Stéphane Grappelli and their Quintette du Hot Club de France in the 1930s and 1940s.[234]\n\n\nImmediately after the War the Saint-Germain-des-Pres quarter and the nearby Saint-Michel quarter became home to many small jazz clubs, including the Caveau des Lorientais, the Club Saint-Germain, the Rose Rouge, the Vieux-Colombier, and the most famous, Le Tabou. They introduced Parisians to the music of Claude Luter, Boris Vian, Sydney Bechet, Mezz Mezzrow, and Henri Salvador. Most of the clubs closed by the early 1960s, as musical tastes shifted toward rock and roll.[235]\n\n\nSome of the finest manouche musicians in the world are found here playing the cafés of the city at night.[234] Some of the more notable jazz venues include the New Morning, Le Sunset, La Chope des Puces and Bouquet du Nord.[233][234] Several yearly festivals take place in Paris, including the Paris Jazz Festival and the rock festival Rock en Seine.[236] The Orchestre de Paris was established in 1967.[237] December 2015 was the 100th anniversary of the birth of Edith Piaf—widely regarded as France's national chanteuse, as well as being one of France's greatest international stars.[238]\n\n\nParis has a big hip hop scene. This music became popular during the 1980s.[239] The presence of a large African and Caribbean community helped to its development, giving political and social status for many minorities.[240]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of films set in Paris\n\n![](image)Salah Zulfikar and Sabah in *Paris and Love* (1972)\nThe movie industry was born in Paris when Auguste and Louis Lumière projected the first motion picture for a paying audience at the Grand Café on 28 December 1895.[241] Many of Paris's concert/dance halls were transformed into cinemas when the media became popular beginning in the 1930s. Paris's largest cinema room today is in the Grand Rex theatre with 2,700 seats.[242]  \nBig multiplex cinemas have been built since the 1990s. UGC Ciné Cité Les Halles with 27 screens, MK2 Bibliothèque with 20 screens and UGC Ciné Cité Bercy with 18 screens are among the largest.[243]\n\n\nParisians tend to share the same movie-going trends as many of the world's global cities, with cinemas primarily dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (*réalisateurs*) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown and appreciated.[244]\n\n\n\n### Restaurants and cuisine[edit]\n\n\nSee also: French cuisine\n\n![](image)Le Zimmer, on the Place du Châtelet\nSince the late 18th century, Paris has been famous for its restaurants and *haute cuisine*, food meticulously prepared and artfully presented. A luxury restaurant, La Taverne Anglaise, opened in 1786 in the arcades of the Palais-Royal by Antoine Beauvilliers; it became a model for future Paris restaurants. The restaurant Le Grand Véfour in the Palais-Royal dates from the same period.[245] The famous Paris restaurants of the 19th century, including the Café de Paris, the Rocher de Cancale, the Café Anglais, Maison Dorée and the Café Riche, were mostly located near the theatres on the Boulevard des Italiens. Several of the best-known restaurants in Paris today appeared during the *Belle Époque*, including Maxim's on Rue Royale, Ledoyen in the gardens of the Champs-Élysées, and the Tour d'Argent on the Quai de la Tournelle.[246]\n\n\nToday, due to Paris's cosmopolitan population, every French regional cuisine and almost every national cuisine in the world can be found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants.[247] The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2018, of the 27 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, ten are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick Alléno and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.[248][249]\n\n\n\n![](image)Les Deux Magots café on Boulevard Saint-Germain\nParis has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers.[246] A bistro is a type of eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood restaurant with a modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition, and different eating habits of Parisian diners.[250] A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867, it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.[251]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fashion in Paris\n\n![](image)Magdalena Frackowiak at Paris Fashion Week (Fall 2011)\nSince the 19th century, Paris has been an international fashion capital, particularly in the domain of haute couture (clothing hand-made to order for private clients).[252] It is home to some of the largest fashion houses in the world, including Dior and Chanel, as well as many other well-known and more contemporary fashion designers, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Christian Lacroix. Paris Fashion Week, held in January and July in the Carrousel du Louvre among other renowned city locations, is one of the top four events on the international fashion calendar.[253][254] Moreover, Paris is also the home of the world's largest cosmetics company: L'Oréal as well as three of the top five global makers of luxury fashion accessories: Louis Vuitton, Hermés, and Cartier.[255] Most of the major fashion designers have their showrooms along the Avenue Montaigne, between the Champs-Élysées and the Seine.\n\n\n\n### Photography[edit]\n\n\nThe inventor Nicéphore Niépce produced the first permanent photograph on a polished pewter plate in Paris in 1825. In 1839, after the death of Niépce, Louis Daguerre patented the Daguerrotype, which became the most common form of photography until the 1860s.[210] The work of Étienne-Jules Marey in the 1880s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography. Photography came to occupy a central role in Parisian Surrealist activity, in the works of Man Ray and Maurice Tabard.[256][257] Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of Paris, including Eugène Atget, noted for his depictions of street scenes, Robert Doisneau, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which *Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville* has become iconic of the romantic vision of Paris), Marcel Bovis, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson.[210] Poster art also became an important art form in Paris in the late nineteenth century, through the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha.[210]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1826, *Le Figaro* is still considered a newspaper of record.[258]\nParis and its close suburbs are home to numerous newspapers, magazines and publications including *Le Monde*, *Le Figaro*, *Libération*, *Le Nouvel Observateur*, *Le Canard enchaîné*, *La Croix*, *Le Parisien* (in *Saint-Ouen*), *Les Échos*, *Paris Match (Neuilly-sur-Seine)*, *Réseaux & Télécoms*, Reuters France, l'Équipe (Boulogne-Billancourt) and *L'Officiel des Spectacles*.[259] France's two most prestigious newspapers, *Le Monde* and *Le Figaro*, are the centrepieces of the Parisian publishing industry.[260] Agence France-Presse is France's oldest, and one of the world's oldest, continually operating news agencies. AFP, as it is colloquially abbreviated, maintains its headquarters in Paris, as it has since 1835.[261] France 24 is a television news channel owned and operated by the French government, and is based in Paris.[262] Another news agency is France Diplomatie, owned and operated by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, and pertains solely to diplomatic news and occurrences.[263]\n\n\nThe most-viewed network in France, TF1, is in nearby Boulogne-Billancourt. France 2, France 3, Canal+, France 5, M6 (Neuilly-sur-Seine), Arte, D8, W9, NT1, NRJ 12, La Chaîne parlementaire, France 4, BFM TV, and Gulli are other stations located in and around the capital.[264] Radio France, France's public radio broadcaster, and its various channels, is headquartered in Paris's 16th arrondissement. Radio France Internationale, another public broadcaster is also based in the city.[265] Paris also holds the headquarters of the La Poste, France's national postal carrier.[266]\n\n\n\n### Holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nBastille Day, a celebration of the storming of the Bastille in 1789, the biggest festival in the city, is a military parade taking place every year on 14 July on the Champs-Élysées, from the Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde. It includes a flypast over the Champs Élysées by the Patrouille de France, a parade of military units and equipment, and a display of fireworks in the evening, the most spectacular being the one at the Eiffel Tower.[267]\n\n\nSome other yearly festivals are Paris-Plages, a festive summertime event when the Right Bank of the Seine is converted into a temporary beach;[267] Journées du Patrimoine, Fête de la Musique, Techno Parade, Nuit Blanche, Cinéma au clair de lune, Printemps des rues, Festival d'automne, and Fête des jardins. The Carnaval de Paris, one of the oldest festivals in Paris, dates back to the Middle Ages.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries in Paris\n\nThe *Bibliothèque nationale de France* (BnF) operates public libraries in Paris, among them the François Mitterrand Library, Richelieu Library, Louvois, Opéra Library, and Arsenal Library.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sainte-Geneviève Library\nThe Forney Library, in the Marais district, is dedicated to the decorative arts; the Arsenal Library occupies a former military building, and has a large collection on French literature; and the Bibliothèque historique de la ville de Paris, also in Le Marais, contains the Paris historical research service. The Sainte-Geneviève Library, designed by Henri Labrouste and built in the mid-1800s, contains a rare book and manuscript division.[269] Bibliothèque Mazarine is the oldest public library in France. The Médiathèque Musicale Mahler opened in 1986 and contains collections related to music. The François Mitterrand Library (nicknamed *Très Grande Bibliothèque*) was completed in 1994 to a design of Dominique Perrault and contains four glass towers.[269]\n\n\nThere are several academic libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library is the largest university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Archéologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des Etudes Ibériques.[270] Other academic libraries include Interuniversity Pharmaceutical Library, Leonardo da Vinci University Library, Paris School of Mines Library, and the René Descartes University Library.[271]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Football in Paris\n\n![](image)Parc des Princes\nParis's most popular sport clubs are the association football club Paris Saint-Germain F.C. and the rugby union clubs Stade Français and Racing 92, the last of which is based just outside the city proper. The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[272] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France). Three UEFA Champions League Finals in the current century have also been played in the Stade de France: the 2000, 2006 and 2022.[273] Paris hosted UEFA Euro 2016.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)2010 Tour de France, Champs Élysées\nThe final stage of the most famous bicycle racing in the world, Tour de France, always finishes in Paris. Since 1975, the race has finished on the Champs-Elysées.[274]\nTennis is another popular sport in Paris and throughout France; the French Open, held every year on the red clay of the Roland Garros National Tennis Centre,[275] is one of the four Grand Slam events of the world professional tennis tour. The 17,000-seat Bercy Arena (officially named *AccorHotels Arena* and formerly known as the *Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy*) is the venue for the annual Paris Masters ATP Tour tennis tournament. The Bercy Arena also hosted the 2017 IIHF World Ice Hockey Championship, together with Cologne, Germany. The final stages of the FIBA EuroBasket 1951 and EuroBasket 1999 were also played in Paris, the latter at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy.\n\n\nThe basketball team Levallois Metropolitans plays some of its games at the 4,000 capacity Stade Pierre de Coubertin.[276] Another top-level professional team, Nanterre 92, plays in Nanterre.\n\n\nIn 2023, a professional American football team, the Paris Saints, were formed in the city[277] joining the European League of Football.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Paris\n\n![](image)The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in Europe.\nParis is a major rail, highway, and air transport hub. Île-de-France Mobilités (IDFM), formerly the Syndicat des transports d'Île-de-France (STIF) and before that the Syndicat des transports parisiens (STP), oversees the transit network in the region.[278] The syndicate coordinates public transport and contracts it out to the RATP (operating 347 bus lines, the Métro, eight tramway lines, and sections of the RER), the SNCF (operating suburban rails, one tramway line and the other sections of the RER) and the Optile consortium of private operators managing 1,176 bus lines.[279]\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 INSEE survey, a majority of Parisians (64.3 percent) use public transport to get to work. Only 10.6 percent commuted to work by automobile. 10.5 percent walked or used roller skates; 5.5 percent commuted by bicycle; and 4.4 percent commuted by motorbike.[280] Bike lanes are being doubled, while electric car incentives are being created. The French capital is banning the most polluting automobiles from key districts.[281][282]\n\n\n\n#### Railways[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Paris railway stations\n\nMain articles: Paris Métro, Réseau Express Régional, Transilien, and Tramways in Île-de-France\n\n![](image)The Paris Métro is the busiest subway network in the European Union.\nA central hub of the national rail network, Paris's six major railway stations (Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est, Gare de Lyon, Gare d'Austerlitz, Gare Montparnasse, Gare Saint-Lazare) and a minor one (Gare de Bercy) are connected to three networks: high-speed rail lines (TGV, Eurostar, Thalys, Intercity Express, Frecciarossa), normal speed trains (Intercités, Intercités de nuit, TER), and the suburban rails (Transilien). The Transilien is the commuter rail network serving Paris region through 8 lines, 392 stations and 1,294 km (804.1 mi) of rails.\n\n\nSince the inauguration of its first line in 1900, Paris's Métro network has grown to become the city's most widely used local transport system; today it carries about 5.23 million passengers daily[283] through 16 lines, 308 stations (391 stops) and 226.9 km (141.0 mi) of rails. Superimposed on this is a 'regional express network', the RER, whose five lines, 257 stops and 587 km (365 mi) of rails connect Paris to more distant parts of the urban area. In addition, the Paris region is served by a light rail network, the tramway. Opened since 1992 for its first line, thirteen lines are currently operational. The network is 164.4 kilometres (102.2 mi) long with 248 stations.\n\n\n\n#### Air[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 2020, Charles de Gaulle Airport was the busiest airport in Europe and the eighth-busiest airport in the world.[284]\nParis is a major international air transport hub with the 5th busiest airport system in the world. The city is served by three commercial international airports: Charles de Gaulle Airport, Orly Airport and Beauvais–Tillé Airport. Together these three airports recorded traffic of 112 million passengers in 2019.[285] There is also one general aviation airport, Paris–Le Bourget Airport, historically the oldest Parisian airport and closest to the city centre, which is now used only for private business flights and air shows. Charles de Gaulle Airport, located on the edge of the northern suburbs of Paris, opened to commercial traffic in 1974 and became the busiest Parisian airport in 1993.[286] For 2017 it was the 5th busiest airport in the world by international traffic and it is the hub for the nation's flag carrier Air France.[287] Beauvais-Tillé Airport, located 69 km (43 mi) north of Paris's city centre, is used by charter airlines and low-cost carriers.\n\n\n\n#### Motorways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Boulevard Périphérique\nThe city is also the most important hub of France's motorway network, and is surrounded by three orbital freeways: the Périphérique,[95] which follows the approximate path of 19th-century fortifications around Paris, the A86 motorway in the inner suburbs, and finally the Francilienne motorway in the outer suburbs. Paris has an extensive road network with over 2,000 km (1,243 mi) of highways and motorways.\n\n\n\n#### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nThe Paris region is the most active water transport area in France, with most of the cargo handled by Ports of Paris in facilities located around Paris. The rivers Loire, Rhine, Rhône, Meuse, and Scheldt can be reached by canals connecting with the Seine, which include the Canal Saint-Martin, Canal Saint-Denis, and the Canal de l'Ourcq.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Cycling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vélib' at the Place de la Bastille\nThere are 440 km (270 mi) of cycle paths and routes in Paris. These include *piste cyclable* (bike lanes separated from other traffic by physical barriers) and *bande cyclable* (a bicycle lane denoted by a painted path on the road). Some 29 km (18 mi) of specially marked bus lanes are free to be used by cyclists, with a protective barrier protecting against encroachments from vehicles.[289] Cyclists have also been given the right to ride in both directions on certain one-way streets. Paris offers a bike sharing system called Vélib' with more than 20,000 public bicycles distributed at 1,800 parking stations.[290]\n\n\n\n### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nElectricity is provided to Paris through a peripheral grid fed by multiple sources. In 2012, around 50% of electricity generated in the Île-de-France came from cogeneration energy plants; other energy sources included thermal power (35%), waste incineration (9% – with cogeneration plants, these provide the city in heat as well), methane gas (5%), hydraulics (1%), solar power (0.1%) and a negligible amount of wind power.[291] A quarter of the city's district heating is to come from a plant in Saint-Ouen-sur-Seine, burning a 50/50-mix of coal and wood pellets.[292]\n\n\n\n### Water and sanitation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view of the Seine, the Île de la Cité and a Bateau Mouche\nParis in its early history had only the rivers Seine and Bièvre for water. From 1809, the Canal de l'Ourcq provided Paris with water from less-polluted rivers to the north-east of the capital.[293] From 1857, the civil engineer Eugène Belgrand, under Napoleon III, oversaw the construction of a series of new aqueducts that brought water from locations all around the city to several reservoirs.[294] From then on, the new reservoir system became Paris's principal source of drinking water, and the remains of the old system, pumped into lower levels of the same reservoirs, were from then on used for the cleaning of Paris's streets. This system is still a major part of Paris's water-supply network. Today Paris has more than 2,400 km (1,491 mi) of underground sewers.[295]\n\n\nAir pollution in Paris, from the point of view of particulate matter (PM10), is the highest in France with 38 μg/m3.[296] From the point of view of nitrogen dioxide pollution, Paris has one of the highest levels in the EU.[297]\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of parks and gardens in Paris and History of Parks and Gardens of Paris\n\n![](image)The lawns of the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont on a sunny day\nParis today has more than 421 municipal parks and gardens, covering more than 3,000 hectares and containing more than 250,000 trees.[298] Two of Paris's oldest and most famous gardens are the Tuileries Garden (created in 1564 for the Tuileries Palace and redone by André Le Nôtre between 1664 and 1672)[299] and the Luxembourg Garden, for the Luxembourg Palace, built for Marie de' Medici in 1612, which today houses the Senate.[300] The *Jardin des plantes* was the first botanical garden in Paris, created in 1626.[301]\n\n\nBetween 1853 and 1870, Emperor Napoleon III and the city's first director of parks and gardens, Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, created the Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes, Parc Montsouris and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, located at the four points of the compass around the city, as well as many smaller parks, squares and gardens in the Paris's quarters.[302] Since 1977, the city has created 166 new parks, most notably the Parc de la Villette (1987), Parc André Citroën (1992), Parc de Bercy (1997) and Parc Clichy-Batignolles (2007).[303] One of the newest parks, the Promenade des Berges de la Seine (2013), built on a former highway on the left bank of the Seine between the Pont de l'Alma and the Musée d'Orsay, has floating gardens.\n\n\n\n### Cemeteries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Paris Catacombs hold the remains of approximately 6 million people.\nDuring the Roman era, the city's main cemetery was located to the outskirts of the left bank settlement, but this changed with the rise of Catholic Christianity, where most every inner-city church had adjoining burial grounds for use by their parishes. With Paris's growth many of these, particularly the city's largest cemetery, the Holy Innocents' Cemetery, were filled to overflowing. When inner-city burials were condemned from 1786, the contents of all Paris's parish cemeteries were transferred to a renovated section of Paris's stone mines, today place Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th arrondissement.[304][305]\n\n\nAfter a tentative creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution in the creation of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.[306] Open from 1804, these were the cemeteries of Père Lachaise, Montmartre, Montparnasse, and later Passy. New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux.[307] Famous people buried in Parisian cemeteries include Oscar Wilde, Frédéric Chopin, Jim Morrison, Édith Piaf and Serge Gainsbourg.[308]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Paris\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne University\nParis is the département with the highest proportion of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a *licence*-level diploma or higher, the highest proportion in France,[309] while 13 percent have no diploma, the third-lowest percentage in France. Education in Paris and the Île-de-France region employs approximately 330,000 people, 170,000 of whom are teachers and professors teaching approximately 2.9 million students in around 9,000 primary, secondary, and higher education schools and institutions.[310]\n\n\nThe University of Paris, founded in the 12th century, is often called the Sorbonne after one of its original medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968. Most of the campuses today are in the Latin Quarter where the old university was located, while others are scattered around the city and the suburbs.[311]\n\n\nThe Paris region hosts France's highest concentration of the *grandes écoles* – 55 specialised centres of higher-education outside or inside the public university structure. The prestigious public universities are usually considered *grands établissements*. Most of the *grandes écoles* were relocated to the suburbs of Paris in the 1960s and 1970s, in new campuses much larger than the old campuses within the crowded City of Paris, though the École Normale Supérieure, PSL University has remained on rue d'Ulm in the 5th arrondissement.[312]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hôtel-Dieu de Paris is the oldest hospital in the city.\nHealth care and emergency medical service in the City of Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system that employs more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals.[313] It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and emergency medical service in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.[313]\n\n\nOne of the most notable hospitals is the Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 651, the oldest hospital in the city and the oldest worldwide still operating,[314] although the current building is the product of a reconstruction of 1877. Other hospitals include Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (one of the largest in Europe), Hôpital Cochin, Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital, Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, Bicêtre Hospital, Beaujon Hospital, the Curie Institute, Lariboisière Hospital, Necker–Enfants Malades Hospital, Hôpital Saint-Louis, Hôpital de la Charité and the American Hospital of Paris.\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### International organisations[edit]\n\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has had its headquarters in Paris since November 1958. Paris is also the home of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).[315] Paris hosts the headquarters of the European Space Agency, the International Energy Agency, European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Banking Authority.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in France\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Paris is exclusively and reciprocally twinned with:[316][317]\n\n\n\n* ![Italy](image) Rome, 1956\n\n\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[318]\n### Other relationships[edit]\n\n\nParis has agreements of friendship and co-operation with:[316]\n\n\n\n* ![Algeria](image) Algiers, 2003\n* ![Jordan](image) Amman, 1987\n* ![Netherlands](image) Amsterdam, 2013\n* ![Greece](image) Athens, 2000\n* ![China](image) Beijing, 1997\n* ![Lebanon](image) Beirut, 1992\n* ![Germany](image) Berlin, 1987\n* ![Republic of the Congo](image) Brazzaville, 2015\n* ![Argentina](image) Buenos Aires, 1999\n* ![Egypt](image) Cairo, 1985\n* ![Morocco](image) Casablanca, 2004\n* ![United States](image) Chicago, 1996\n* ![Denmark](image) Copenhagen, 2005\n* ![Senegal](image) Dakar, 2011\n* ![Qatar](image) Doha, 2010\n* ![Switzerland](image) Geneva, 2002\n* ![Turkey](image) Istanbul, 2009\n* ![Indonesia](image) Jakarta, 1995\n* ![State of Palestine](image) Jericho, 2009\n* ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Kinshasa, 2014\n* ![Japan](image) Kyoto, 1958\n* ![Portugal](image) Lisbon, 1998\n* ![United Kingdom](image) London, 2001\n* ![Spain](image) Madrid, 2000\n* ![Mexico](image) Mexico City, 1999\n* ![Uruguay](image) Montevideo, 2013\n* ![Canada](image) Montreal, 2006\n* ![Russia](image) Moscow, 1992\n* ![Cambodia](image) Phnom Penh, 2007\n* ![Brazil](image) Porto Alegre, 2001\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Prague, 1997\n* ![Canada](image) Quebec City, 1996\n* ![Morocco](image) Rabat, 2004\n* ![State of Palestine](image) Ramallah, 2011\n* ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro, 2009\n* ![Saudi Arabia](image) Riyadh, 1997\n* ![Russia](image) Saint Petersburg, 1997\n* ![Yemen](image) Sanaa, 1987\n* ![United States](image) San Francisco, 1996\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, 1997\n* ![Brazil](image) São Paulo, 2004\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, 1991\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Sofia, 1998\n* ![Australia](image) Sydney, 1998\n* ![Georgia (country)](image) Tbilisi, 1997\n* ![Israel](image) Tel Aviv, 2010\n* ![Japan](image) Tokyo, 1982\n* ![Tunisia](image) Tunis, 2004\n* ![Poland](image) Warsaw, 1999\n* ![United States](image) Washington, D.C., 2000\n* ![Armenia](image) Yerevan, 1998\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Art Nouveau in Paris\n* Art Deco in Paris\n* C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group\n* International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts held in Paris in 1925\n* Megacity\n* Outline of France\n* Outline of Paris\n* Paris syndrome\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The word was most likely created by Parisians of the lower popular class who spoke \\*argot\\*, then \\*parigot\\*was used in a provocative manner outside the Parisian region and throughout France to mean Parisians in general.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.

It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special *comune* named *Comune di Roma Capitale*. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[2] Rome is the country's most populated *comune* and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[3] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[4] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[5] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the \"Eternal City\".[6] Rome is generally considered to be the \"cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture\", and the centre of the Catholic Church.[7][8][9]\n\n\nRome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.[10] The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis.[11] It was first called *The Eternal City* (Latin: *Urbs Aeterna*; Italian: *La Città Eterna*) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.[12][13] Rome is also called \"Caput Mundi\" (Capital of the World). \n\n\nAfter the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world.[14] In this way, Rome first became one of the major centres of the Renaissance[15] and then became the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.\n\n\nIn 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited city in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy.[16] Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[17] The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean[18] (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many multinational companies, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Ancient Romans' founding myth,[20] the name *Roma* came from the city's founder and first king, Romulus.[1]\n\n\nHowever, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.[21] As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name *Roma*. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:[22]\n\n\n\n* From *Rumon* or *Rumen*, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb ῥέω (*rhéō*) 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb *ruō* 'to hurry, rush';[b]\n* From the Etruscan word 𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀 (*ruma*), whose root is *\\*rum-* \"teat\", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;\n* From the Greek word ῥώμη (*rhṓmē*), which means *strength*.[c]\n\n\n### Other names and symbols[edit]\n\n\nRome has also been called in ancient times simply \"Urbs\" (central city),[23] from *urbs roma*, or identified with its ancient Roman symbol of SPQR, the symbol of its in Rome constituted republican government. Furthermore Rome has been called Urbs Aeterna (The Eternal City), Caput Mundi (The Capital of the world), Throne of St. Peter and Roma Capitale.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rome\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Rome.\n\n### Earliest history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Founding of Rome\n\nHistorical States\n\n\n> \n> Roman Kingdom 753–509 BC  \n> \n> Roman Republic 509–27 BC  \n> \n> Roman Empire 27 BC– 395 AD  \n> \n> Western Roman Empire 286–476  \n> \n> Kingdom of Italy 476–493  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 493–536  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 536–546  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 546–547  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 547–549  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 549–552  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 552–751  \n> \n> Kingdom of the Lombards 751–756  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 756–1798  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1798–1799  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1799–1809  \n> \n> ![](image) First French Empire 1809–1814  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1814–1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1849–1870  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1870–1943  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Social Republic 1943–1944  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1944–1946  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Republic 1946–present  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nWhile there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.[10] Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, each hill between the sea and the Capitoline Hill was topped by a village (on the Capitoline, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).[24] However, none of them yet had an urban quality.[24] Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"synoecism\") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.[24] This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae).[24] These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the \"birth\" of the city.[24] Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Legend of the founding of Rome[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Romulus and Remus and Romulus\n\n![](image)*Capitoline Wolf*, a sculpture of the mythical she-wolf suckling the infant twins Romulus and Remus\nTraditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf.[20] They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC.[26] This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.[27]\nThis was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC. In addition, Strabo mentions an older story, that the city was an Arcadian colony founded by Evander. Strabo also writes that Lucius Coelius Antipater believed that Rome was founded by Greeks.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Monarchy and republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancient Rome, Roman Kingdom, and Roman Republic\n\n![](image)The Temple of Portunus, god of grain storage, keys, livestock and ports.[30] Rome, built between 120 and 80 BC\n![](image)The Roman Forum are the remains of those buildings that during most of ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic centre of the city and the neuralgic centre of all the Roman civilisation.[31]\nAfter the foundation by Romulus according to a legend,[26] Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.[26]\n\n\nIn 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, Volsci, Aequi, and Marsi.[32] After becoming master of Latium, Rome led several wars (against the Gauls, Osci-Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto, allied with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus) whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula, from the central area up to Magna Graecia.[33]\n\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the Balkans, through the three Punic Wars (264–146 BC) fought against the city of Carthage and the three Macedonian Wars (212–168 BC) against Macedonia.[34] The first Roman provinces were established at this time: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Hispania, Macedonia, Achaea and Africa.[35]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the optimates, representing the conservative part of the Senate, and the populares, which relied on the help of the plebs (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus,[36] and the war against Jugurtha,[36] there was a civil war from which the general Sulla emerged victorious.[36] A major slave revolt under Spartacus followed,[37] and then the establishment of the first Triumvirate with Caesar, Pompey and Crassus.[37]\n\n\nThe conquest of Gaul made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a second civil war against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory, Caesar established himself as dictator for life.[37] His assassination led to a second Triumvirate among Octavian (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), Mark Antony and Lepidus, and to another civil war between Octavian and Antony.[38]\n\n\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Ancient-Imperial-Roman palaces of the Palatine, a series of palaces located in the Palatine Hill, express power and wealth of emperors from Augustus until the 4th century.\n![](image)The Imperial fora belong to a series of *monumental fora* (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors. Also seen in the image is Trajan's Market.\n![](image)The Temple of Claudius to the south (left) of the Colosseum (model of Imperial Rome at the Museo della civiltà romana in Rome)\nIn 27 BC, Octavian became *princeps civitatis* and took the title of Augustus, founding the principate, a diarchy between the *princeps* and the senate.[38] During the reign of Nero, two thirds of the city was ruined after the Great Fire of Rome, and the persecution of Christians commenced.[39][40][41] Rome was established as a de facto empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor Trajan. Rome was confirmed as caput Mundi, i.e. the capital of the known world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the Julio-Claudian,[42] Flavian (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the Colosseum),[42] and Antonine dynasties.[43] This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by Jesus Christ in Judea in the first half of the first century (under Tiberius) and popularised by his apostles through the empire and beyond.[44] The Antonine age is considered the zenith of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates and from Britain to Egypt.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colosseum at night\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into a 50-year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260 to 274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions – Britain, Spain, and North Africa – were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s–280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The Persian Empire invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.[45] Emperor Diocletian (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the Tetrarchy which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed price controls which did not last. He or Constantine regionalised the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Vérone et la province de Grande-Arménie, Mélanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in Nicomedia. In 296, he elevated Maximian to *Augustus* of the western half, where he ruled mostly from Mediolanum when not on the move.[45] In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in Trier and Galerius in Sirmium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they, in turn, appointed two colleagues for themselves.[45]\n\n\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306–313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325–330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called Edict of Milan of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence, which, however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; Constantinople.[46]\n\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the Edict of Thessalonica issued in the name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and Theodosius I – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, Arcadius and Honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to Ravenna in 408, but from 450 the emperors mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Visigoths sacking Rome in 410, by Joseph-Noël Sylvestre (1890), the first time in c. 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the Visigoths led by Alaric I,[48] but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by Genseric, king of the Vandals.[49] The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of Romulus Augustus on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the Middle Ages.[46]\n\n\nThe decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443, and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised.[50]\n\n\nHowever, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. The population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, the population dropped to 30,000 but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.[51] The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.[52] The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.[53] Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fall of the Western Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Vandals sacking Rome in 455, by Karl Briullov (1830s)\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War, which devastated the city in 546 and 550. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273[54] to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535–554),[55] reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.[56] It is generally thought the population of the city until 300 AD was 1 million (estimates range from 2 million to 750,000) declining to 750–800,000 in 400 AD, 450–500,000 in 450 AD and down to 80–100,000 in 500 AD (though it may have been twice this).[57]\n\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church.\n\n\nAfter the Lombard invasion of Italy (569–572), the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality, the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Lombards.[58] In 729, the Lombard king Liutprand donated the north Latium town of Sutri to the Church, starting its temporal power.[58] In 756, Pepin the Short, after having defeated the Lombards, gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the Exarchate of Ravenna, thus creating the Papal States.[58] Since this period, three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility (together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace), and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius, and Emperor.[58] These three parties (theocratic, republican, and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.[58] On Christmas night of 800, Charlemagne was crowned in Rome as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III: on that occasion, the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail view on an illustration by Raphael portraying the crowning of Charlemagne in Old Saint Peter's Basilica, on 25 December 800\nIn 846, Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city's walls, but managed to loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall.[59] After the decay of Carolingian power, Rome fell prey to feudal chaos: several noble families fought against the pope, the emperor, and each other. These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of Crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors Otto II and Otto III.[60] The scandals of this period forced the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana, who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became involved into the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV.[60] Subsequently, Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans under Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in Castel Sant'Angelo.[60]\n\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a *senatore* or *patrizio*. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the commune, a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.[60] Pope Lucius II fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor Pope Eugenius III: by this stage, the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by Arnaldo da Brescia, a monk who was a religious and social reformer.[61] After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by Adrianus IV, which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.[61] Under Pope Innocent III, whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a *Senatore*, who was subject to the pope.[61]\n\n\nIn this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers.[62][63][64]\n\n\nIn 1266, Charles of Anjou, who was heading south to fight the Hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator. Charles founded the Sapienza, the university of Rome.[61] In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in Viterbo, could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the conclave.[61] In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: Annibaldi, Caetani, Colonna, Orsini, Conti, nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome in 1376 and ended the Avignon Papacy.\nPope Boniface VIII, born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain; he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna family and, in 1300, called for the first Jubilee of Christianity, which brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.[61] However, his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair, who took him prisoner and killed him in Anagni.[61] Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377).[65] During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, Cola di Rienzo, came to power.[65] An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of *Tribuno*, his reforms were rejected by the populace.[65] Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal Albornoz, who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.[65] Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under Gregory XI.[65] The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the Western Schism (1377–1418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.[65]\n\n\n\n### Early modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Renaissance\n\n![](image)Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by Mario Cartaro (from 1575) shows the city's primary monuments.\n![](image)Castel Sant'Angelo, or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia was created by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1629.\nIn 1418, the Council of Constance settled the Western Schism, and a Roman pope, Martin V, was elected.[65] This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the Renaissance.[65] The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from Nicholas V, founder of the Vatican Library, to Pius II, humanist and literate, from Sixtus IV, a warrior pope, to Alexander VI, immoral and nepotist, from Julius II, soldier and patron, to Leo X, who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.[65]\n\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the Italian Renaissance moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new Saint Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and *Ponte Sisto* (the first bridge to be built across the Tiber since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including Michelangelo, Perugino, Raphael, Ghirlandaio, Luca Signorelli, Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli.\n\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in nepotism and simony. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the Pietà by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartments. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II (1503–1513) and his successors Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family.\n\n\n\n![](image)Carnival in Rome, c. 1650, by Johannes Lingelbach\n![](image)*A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome*, by Hendrik Frans van Lint, c. 1730\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor Constantine the Great[66] (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli and Bramante, who built the temple of San Pietro in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the Villa Farnesina, the Raphael's Rooms, plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb of Julius II.\n\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The War of the League of Cognac caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since the previous sack; in 1527, the Landsknechts of Emperor Charles V sacked the city, bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.[65]\n\n\nBeginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.[65] Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V, Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.[67] The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.[67]\n\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families (Barberini, Pamphili, Chigi, Rospigliosi, Altieri, Odescalchi) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.[67] During the Age of Enlightenment, new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.[65] But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.[65]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived Roman Republic (1798–1800), which was established under the influence of the French Revolution. The Papal States were restored in June 1800, but during Napoleon's reign Rome was annexed as a *Département* of the French Empire: first as *Département du Tibre* (1808–1810) and then as *Département Rome* (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the Congress of Vienna of 1814.\n\n\nIn 1849, a second Roman Republic was proclaimed during a year of revolutions in 1848. Two of the most influential figures of the Italian unification, Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, fought for the short-lived republic.\n\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 with the temporary capital in Florence. That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of Napoleon III. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. In 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia. Pope Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.[68] In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bombardment of Rome by Allied planes, 1943\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of Italian Fascism led by Benito Mussolini, who led a march on the city. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.[69] The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943, the San Lorenzo district was subject to Allied bombing raids, resulting in about 3,000 fatalities and 11,000 injuries, of whom another 1,500 died.[70] Mussolini was arrested on 25 July 1943. On the date of the Italian Armistice 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an open city. It was liberated on 4 June 1944.\n\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"Italian economic miracle\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of *la dolce vita* (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, *Roman Holiday* and *La Dolce Vita* filmed in the city's iconic Cinecittà Studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s when the *comune* had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Rome\nRome is in the Lazio region of central Italy on the Tiber (Italian: *Tevere*) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the Aventine Hill, the Caelian Hill, the Capitoline Hill, the Esquiline Hill, the Palatine Hill, the Quirinal Hill, and the Viminal Hill. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\n\nAlthough the city centre is about 24 km (15 mi) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of Ostia is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from 13 m (43 ft) above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to 139 m (456 ft) above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).[71] The *Comune* of Rome covers an overall area of about 1,285 km2 (496 sq mi), including many green areas.\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of parks and gardens in Rome\n\n![](image)The Temple of Aesculapius, in the Villa Borghese gardens\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.[72] The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are the Villa Borghese, Villa Ada, and Villa Doria Pamphili. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill, comprising some 1.8 km2 (0.7 sq mi). The Villa Sciarra is on the hill, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere, the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of Pincio and Villa Medici. There is also a notable pine wood at Castelfusano, near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin, including the Pineto Regional Park and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Rome\n\n![](image)Stone pines in the Villa Doria Pamphili\nRome has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*),[73] with hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters.\n\n\nIts average annual temperature is above 21 °C (70 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. In the coldest month, January, the average temperature is 12.6 °C (54.7 °F) during the day and 2.1 °C (35.8 °F) at night. In the warmest month, August, the average temperature is 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) during the day and 17.3 °C (63.1 °F) at night.\n\n\nDecember, January and February are the coldest months, with a daily mean temperature of approximately 8 °C (46 °F). Temperatures during these months generally vary between 10 and 15 °C (50 and 59 °F) during the day and between 3 and 5 °C (37 and 41 °F) at night, with colder or warmer spells occurring frequently. Snowfall is rare but not unheard of, with light snow or flurries occurring on some winters, generally without accumulation, and major snowfalls on a very rare occurrence (the most recent ones were in 2018, 2012 and 1986).[74][75][76]\n\n\nThe average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November. Sea temperatures vary from a low of 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) in February to a high of 25.0 °C (77.0 °F) in August.[77]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Rome was 42.9 °C (109.2 °F) on 18 July 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rome Ciampino Airport, elevation: 129 m or 423 ft, 1991-2020 normals, extremes 1944–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 39.7(103.5)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 4.3(39.7)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −6.6(20.1)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 65.6(2.58)\n | 62.8(2.47)\n | 58.6(2.31)\n | 68.6(2.70)\n | 56.9(2.24)\n | 30.1(1.19)\n | 19.8(0.78)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 64.9(2.56)\n | 88.1(3.47)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 98.3(3.87)\n | 752.0(29.61)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.40\n | 7.48\n | 6.85\n | 7.42\n | 5.54\n | 3.38\n | 2.16\n | 2.20\n | 6.00\n | 7.32\n | 8.84\n | 9.44\n | 74.03\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 75.8\n | 71.5\n | 70.6\n | 70.4\n | 69.0\n | 65.4\n | 63.3\n | 64.1\n | 69.1\n | 74.0\n | 77.9\n | 77.2\n | 70.7\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 155.9\n | 171.9\n | 203.1\n | 221.1\n | 276.5\n | 298.8\n | 337.6\n | 320.2\n | 237.9\n | 200.6\n | 153.3\n | 146.9\n | 2,723.9\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[79] |\n| Source 2: Temperature estreme in Toscana[80] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographics of Italy\n\n![](image)Rome (comune) age-sex pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 194,500 | —     |\n| 1871  | 212,432 | +9.2% |\n| 1881  | 273,952 | +29.0% |\n| 1901  | 422,411 | +54.2% |\n| 1911  | 518,917 | +22.8% |\n| 1921  | 660,235 | +27.2% |\n| 1931  | 930,926 | +41.0% |\n| 1936  | 1,150,589 | +23.6% |\n| 1951  | 1,651,754 | +43.6% |\n| 1961  | 2,188,160 | +32.5% |\n| 1971  | 2,781,993 | +27.1% |\n| 1981  | 2,840,259 | +2.1% |\n| 1991  | 2,775,250 | −2.3% |\n| 2001  | 2,663,182 | −4.0% |\n| 2011  | 2,617,175 | −1.7% |\n| 2021  | 2,770,226 | +5.8% |\n| Source: ISTAT, 2022 |\n\n\nIn 550 BC, Rome was the second largest city in Italy, with Tarentum being the largest.[*citation needed*] It had an area of about 285 ha (700 acres) and an estimated population of 35,000. Other sources suggest the population was just under 100,000 from 600 to 500 BC.[81][82] When the Republic was founded in 509 BC the census recorded a population of 130,000.[83] The republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings. Other sources suggest a population of 150,000 in 500 BC. It surpassed 300,000 in 150 BC.[84][85][86][87][88]\n\n\nThe size of the city at the time of the Emperor Augustus is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.[89][90][91][92] Estimates of the city's population towards and after the end of the Roman empire also vary. A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.[93] According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452, and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535–552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory I (590–604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.[94] Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the reform of 419.[95] Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.[96] Novel 36 of Emperor Valentinian III records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the Vandals, and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the Early Middle Ages from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance.[97]\n\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*] Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nIn mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi)). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.[98] The current[*when?*] birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.9 million.[99] Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in the Rome metropolitan area.[100][101][102][103][104]\n\n\n\n### Origin groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Esquilino *rione*\nAccording to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT,[105] approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians. About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7% of the population. The remaining 4.8% are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), and Chinese (10,283).\n\n\nThe Esquilino *rione*, off Termini Railway Station, has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood. It is perceived as Rome's Chinatown. Immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there. A commercial district, Esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine. There are wholesale clothes shops. Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.[106]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Roman dialect and Latin\n\n![](image)Advertisement in Romanesco dialect at a subway station in Rome\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive, however. Through the process of Romanization, the peoples of Italy, Gallia, the Iberian Peninsula and Dacia developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonisation and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the Norman Conquest, borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.[107]\n\n\nThe medieval Roman dialect belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects, and was thus much closer to the Neapolitan language than to the Florentine.[108][109] A typical example of Romanesco of that period is *Vita di Cola di Rienzo [it]* (\"Life of Cola di Rienzo\"), written by an anonymous Roman during the 14th century.[108] Starting with the 16th century, the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the Tuscan dialect (from which modern Italian derives) starting with the reigns of the two Medici popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and with the Sack of Rome in 1527, two events which provoked a large immigration from Tuscany.[110][111] Therefore, current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy.[111]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Rome\n\nSee also: Vatican City\n\n![](image)Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome's Cathedral, built in 324, and partly rebuilt between 1660 and 1734\n![](image)Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and the largest Catholic Marian church in Rome\nMuch like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Christian, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the pontifex maximus and later the seat of the Vatican and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the Religio Romana (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were Jupiter, the Most High, and Mars, the god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, Romulus and Remus, according to tradition. Other deities such as Vesta and Minerva were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as Mithraism. Later, after St Peter and St Paul were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.\n\n\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, the Basilica di San Clemente, San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane and the Church of the Gesù. There are also the ancient Catacombs of Rome underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the Pontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Biblical Institute, Pontifical Gregorian University, and Pontifical Oriental Institute.\n\n\nSince the end of the Roman Republic, Rome is also the centre of an important Jewish community,[112] which was once based in Trastevere, and later in the Roman Ghetto. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the *Tempio Maggiore*.\n\n\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the *Mons Vaticanus* (Vatican Hill), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the Tiber, the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV, later expanded by the current fortification walls of Paul III, Pius IV, and Urban VIII. When the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. \n\n\nRome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the Middle Ages, Rome kept its status as Papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the Pilate's stairs: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, which Jesus Christ stood on during his Passion on his way to trial.[113]\n\n\n\n![Panorama of St. Peter's Square](image)\nSt. Peter's Square in Vatican City\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Rome, City Council of Rome, Elections in Rome, and Administrative subdivisions of Rome\n\n![](image)Current seat of the Mayor of Rome, *Palazzo Senatorio* on Capitoline Hill.\n![](image)The Palazzo del Quirinale, now seat of the President of the Italian Republic\nRome constitutes a comune *speciale*, named *\"Roma Capitale\"*,[114] and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 *comuni* of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the *comune* is the *Palazzo Senatorio* on the Capitoline Hill, the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as *\"Campidoglio\"*, the Italian name of the hill.\n\n\nSince 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called *municipi* (sing. *municipio*) (until 2001 named *circoscrizioni*).[115] They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each *municipio* is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The *municipi* frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,[116] and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.[117]\n\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 *rioni*, all of which are located within the Aurelian Walls except Prati and Borgo. These originate from the 14 regions of Augustan Rome, which evolved in the Middle Ages into the medieval rioni.[118] In the Renaissance, under Pope Sixtus V, they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under Pope Benedict XIV in 1743.\n\n\nRome is the principal town of the Metropolitan City of Rome, operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old provincia di Roma, which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until Civitavecchia. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At 5,352 km2 (2,066 sq mi), its dimensions are comparable to the region of Liguria. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the Lazio region.[119]\n\n\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the Italian Government. The official residences of the President of the Italian Republic and the Italian Prime Minister, the seats of both houses of the Italian Parliament and that of the Italian Constitutional Court are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in Palazzo della Farnesina near the Olympic stadium.\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FAO headquarters in Rome, Circo Massimo\nAmong the global cities, Rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian capital city and a sovereign possession of the Holy See, which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[120][121] Rome is the seat of the so-called \"Polo Romano\" made up by three main international agencies of the United Nations: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).[122]\n\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The Treaties of the EU are located in Palazzo della Farnesina. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (predecessor to the European Union), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed European Constitution in July 2004. Rome is the seat of the European Olympic Committee and of the NATO Defense College. The city is the place where the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the European Convention on Human Rights were formulated. The city hosts also other important international entities such as the IDLO (International Development Law Organisation), the ICCROM (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n\n\n#### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Italy\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Rome is exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Paris, France, 1956\n\n\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[123][124][125][126][127]\nRome's other partner cities are:[128]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Achacachi, Bolivia[128]\n* ![](image) Algiers, Algeria[128]\n* ![](image) Beijing, China[129][130]\n* ![](image) Belgrade, Serbia[128]\n* ![](image) Brasília, Brazil[128]\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina[128]\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt[128]\n* ![](image) Cincinnati, United States[128]\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine[128]\n* ![](image) Kobanî, Syria[131]\n* ![](image) Kraków, Poland[132]\n* ![](image) Madrid, Spain[133]\n* ![](image) Multan, Pakistan[134]\n* ![](image) New Delhi, India[128]\n* ![](image) New York City, United States[135]\n* ![](image) Plovdiv, Bulgaria[128]\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea[136][137]\n* ![](image) Sydney, Australia[128]\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania[138][139]\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran[128]\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan[140]\n* ![](image) Tongeren, Belgium[128]\n* ![](image) Tunis, Tunisia[141]\n* ![](image) Washington, D.C., United States[142]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Rome\n\n![](image)Palazzo Eni, in the EUR business district, headquarters of Eni, considered one of the world's oil and gas \"supermajors\".[143]\n![](image)Enel's headquarters in Rome, the second largest power company in the world by revenue after the State Grid Corporation of China.[144]\n![](image)Orizzonte Europa, BNL headquarters in Rome\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single *Ministeri*), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), the NATO Defence College, and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).\n\n\nAccording to the GaWC study of world cities, Rome is a \"Beta +\" city.[145] The city was ranked in 2014 as 32nd in the Global Cities Index, the highest in Italy.[146] With a 2005 GDP of €94.376 billion (US$121.5 billion),[147][*needs update*] the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.[147] Rome's economy grows at around 4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.[147] This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt. Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of €29,153 (US$37,412), which was second in Italy (after Milan), and is more than 134.1% of the EU average GDP per capita.[148][*needs update*] Rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in Italy, reaching €47,076,890,463 in 2008,[149][*needs update*] yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in Italy, with €24,509.[149] On a global level, Rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd.[150][*needs update*] The Rome area had a GDP amounting to $167.8 billion, and $38,765 per capita.[151]\n\n\nAlthough the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry, and it is largely dominated by services, high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, Fiumicino, is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: Enel, Eni, and Telecom Italia.[152]\n\n\nUniversities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the Italian film industry, thanks to the Cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the Esposizione Universale Roma (EUR); the *Torrino* (further south from the EUR); the *Magliana*; the *Parco de' Medici-Laurentina* and the so-called *Tiburtina-valley* along the ancient Via Tiburtina.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in Rome and List of tourist attractions in Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia in Piazza di Spagna, the Spanish Steps and Trinità dei Monti\n![](image)Piazza Navona\n![](image)The Vatican Museums are the 8th most visited art museum in the world (2021).[153]\nRome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent \"villas\" (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums – Capitoline Museums, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs. Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7–10 million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and the Vatican Museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.[154]\n\n\nRome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of archaeological research. There are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the American Academy in Rome,[155] and The Swedish Institute at Rome.[156] Rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the Forum Romanum, Trajan's Market, Trajan's Forum,[157] the Colosseum, and the Pantheon, to name but a few. The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the world.[158][159]\n\n\nRome contains a vast collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods. Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome, with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Metal-work, coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are considered to be 'minor' forms of Roman artwork.[160] Rome later became a major centre of Renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general. Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice. The city was affected greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and Cortona.[161] In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour,[162] when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy, and architecture. Rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as Pannini and Bernardo Bellotto. Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes[163] and museums.\n\n\nRome has a growing stock of contemporary and modern art and architecture. The National Gallery of Modern Art has works by Balla, Morandi, Pirandello, Carrà, De Chirico, De Pisis, Guttuso, Fontana, Burri, Mastroianni, Turcato, Kandisky, and Cézanne on permanent exhibition. 2010 saw the opening of Rome's newest arts foundation, a contemporary art and architecture gallery designed by acclaimed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. Known as MAXXI – National Museum of the 21st Century Arts it restores a dilapidated area with striking modern architecture. Maxxi[164] features a campus dedicated to culture, experimental research laboratories, international exchange and study and research. It is one of Rome's most ambitious modern architecture projects alongside Renzo Piano's Auditorium Parco della Musica[165] and Massimiliano Fuksas' Rome Convention Center, Centro Congressi Italia EUR, in the EUR district, due to open in 2016.[166] The convention centre features a huge translucent container inside which is suspended a steel and teflon structure resembling a cloud and which contains meeting rooms and an auditorium with two piazzas open to the neighbourhood on either side.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sapienza University of Rome, founded in 1303\nRome is a nationwide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. It boasts a large variety of academies and colleges, and has always been a major worldwide intellectual and educational centre, especially during Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, along with Florence.[167] According to the City Brands Index, Rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.[168]\n\n\nRome has many universities and colleges. Its first university, La Sapienza (founded in 1303), is one of the largest in the world, with more than 140,000 students attending; in 2005 it ranked as Europe's 33rd best university[169] and in 2013 the Sapienza University of Rome ranked as the 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its *World University Rankings*.[170] and has been ranked among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges.[171] In order to decrease the overcrowding of La Sapienza, two new public universities were founded during the last decades: Tor Vergata in 1982, and Roma Tre in 1992. Rome hosts also the LUISS School of Government,[172] Italy's most important graduate university in the areas of international affairs and European studies as well as LUISS Business School, Italy's most important business school. Rome ISIA was founded in 1973 by Giulio Carlo Argan and is Italy's oldest institution in the field of industrial design.\n\n\n\n![](image)Biblioteca Casanatense\nRome contains many pontifical universities and other institutes, including the British School at Rome, the French School in Rome, the Pontifical Gregorian University (the oldest Jesuit university in the world, founded in 1551), Istituto Europeo di Design, the Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici, the Link Campus of Malta, and the Università Campus Bio-Medico. Rome is also the location of two American Universities; The American University of Rome[173] and John Cabot University as well as St. John's University branch campus, John Felice Rome Center, a campus of Loyola University Chicago and Temple University Rome, a campus of Temple University.[174] The Roman Colleges are several seminaries for students from foreign countries studying for the priesthood at the Pontifical Universities.[175] Examples include the Venerable English College, the Pontifical North American College, the Scots College, and the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome.\nRome's major libraries include: the Biblioteca Angelica, opened in 1604, making it Italy's first public library; the Biblioteca Vallicelliana, established in 1565; the Biblioteca Casanatense, opened in 1701; the National Central Library, one of the two national libraries in Italy, which contains 4,126,002 volumes; The Biblioteca del Ministero degli Affari Esteri, specialised in diplomacy, foreign affairs and modern history; the Biblioteca dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana; the Biblioteca Don Bosco, one of the largest and most modern of all Salesian libraries; the Biblioteca e Museo teatrale del Burcardo, a museum-library specialised in history of drama and theatre; the Biblioteca della Società Geografica Italiana, which is based in the Villa Celimontana and is the most important geographical library in Italy, and one of Europe's most important;[176] and the Vatican Library, one of the oldest and most important libraries in the world, which was formally established in 1475, though in fact much older and has 75,000 codices, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. There are also many specialist libraries attached to various foreign cultural institutes in Rome, among them that of the American Academy in Rome, the French Academy in Rome and the Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute of Art History, a German library, often noted for excellence in the arts and sciences.[177]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture in Rome\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in EUR district\nThis section is an excerpt from Architecture of Rome.[edit]\nThe architecture of Rome over the centuries has greatly developed from Ancient Roman architecture to Italian modern and contemporary architecture. Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture.[178] Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in style.\n\n#### Fountains and aqueducts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of fountains in Rome and List of aqueducts in the city of Rome\n\n![](image)The Trevi Fountain. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of Nicola Salvi.\nRome is a city known for its numerous fountains, built-in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had fountains for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of Rome. During the Roman Empire, in 98 AD, according to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named *curator aquarum* or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.[179]\n\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other degraded Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".[180]\n\n\n\n#### Statues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Talking statues of Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana dei Fiumi by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1648\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the talking statues of Rome. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the Pasquino and the Marforio, yet there are four other noted ones: il Babuino, Madama Lucrezia, il Facchino and Abbot Luigi. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents Menelaus, Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be Silenus, Marforio represents Oceanus, Madama Lucrezia is a bust of Isis, and il Facchino is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or graffiti expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to Giordano Bruno in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n\n\n#### Obelisks and columns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of obelisks in Rome\n\n![](image)Flaminio Obelisk, Piazza del Popolo\nThe city hosts eight ancient Egyptian and five ancient Roman obelisks, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an ancient Ethiopian obelisk in Rome.[181] The city contains some of obelisks in piazzas, such as in Piazza Navona, St Peter's Square, Piazza Montecitorio, and Piazza del Popolo, and others in villas, thermae parks and gardens, such as in Villa Celimontana, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Pincian Hill. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also Trajan's and Antonine Column, two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in Piazza Colonna and it was built around 180 AD by Commodus in memory of his parents. The Column of Marcus Aurelius was inspired by Trajan's Column at Trajan's Forum, which is part of the Imperial Fora.[182]\n\n\n\n#### Bridges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of bridges in Rome\n\n![](image)Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset\nThe city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the Tiber. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is Ponte dei Quattro Capi, which connects the Isola Tiberina with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are Ponte Cestio, Ponte Sant'Angelo and Ponte Milvio. Considering Ponte Nomentano, also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the Aniene, currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.[183] Other noteworthy bridges are Ponte Sisto, the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; Ponte Rotto, actually the only remaining arch of the ancient *Pons Aemilius*, collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the Ponte Sant'Angelo, which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by Bernini in 1688.[184]\n\n\n\n#### Catacombs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catacombs of Rome\n\n![](image)The Vatican Caves, the place where many popes are buried\nRome has an extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include pagan and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through tuff, a soft volcanic rock, outside the boundaries of the city, because Roman law forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the Papacy which has invested in the Salesians of Don Bosco the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Rome and Events in Rome\n\n![](image)The Teatro dell'Opera di Roma at the Piazza Beniamino Gigli\nRome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new Parco della Musica, one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004.\n\n\nRome has also had a major impact on music history. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.\n\n\nBetween 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a \"new Hollywood\" because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.[185]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Via Condotti\nRome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor after Milan, New York, and Paris, and beating London.[186]\n\n\nMajor luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi,[187] Laura Biagiotti, Brioni, and Renato Balestra, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Versace have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman cuisine\n\n![](image)*Spaghetti alla carbonara*, a typical Roman dish\nRome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the ancient age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.[188]\n\n\nLater, during the Renaissance, Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef working for Pius IV; he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook *Opera dell'arte del cucinare* was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.[189]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Concia di zucchine*, an example of Roman-Jewish cuisine\nThe Testaccio, Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, was often known as the \"belly\" or \"slaughterhouse\" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or *vaccinari*.[190] The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the \"fifth quarter\".[190] The old-fashioned *coda alla vaccinara* (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers)[190] is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs.[190]\n\n\nIn the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common).[191] In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the *cucina giudaico-romanesca*.\n\n\nExamples of Roman dishes include *saltimbocca alla romana* – a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; *carciofi alla romana* – artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *carciofi alla giudia* – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *spaghetti alla carbonara* – spaghetti with bacon, eggs and pecorino; and *gnocchi di semolino alla romana* – semolina dumpling, Roman-style.[192]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of films set in Rome and List of films set in ancient Rome\n\n![](image)Entrance to the Cinecittà studios, the largest film studio in Europe[193]\nRome hosts the Cinecittà Studios,[194] the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where many of today's biggest box office hits are filmed. The 99-acre (40 ha) studio complex is 9.0 km (5.6 mi) from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to Hollywood, with well over 5,000 professionals – from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFounded in 1937 by Benito Mussolini, the studios were bombed by the Western Allies during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecittà was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with Federico Fellini. Today, Cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walkout\" with a completed film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stadio Olimpico, home of A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio, is one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity of over 70,000.[195]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country.\nThe city hosted the final games of the 1934 and 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nThe latter took place in the Stadio Olimpico, which is also the shared home stadium for local Serie A clubs S.S. Lazio, founded in 1900, and A.S. Roma, founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the Derby della Capitale has become a staple of Roman sports culture.[196]\nFootballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi (both for A.S. Roma), and Alessandro Nesta (for S.S. Lazio).\n\n\n\n![](image)Stadio dei Marmi\nRome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics, with great success, using many ancient sites such as the Villa Borghese and the Thermae of Caracalla as venues. For the Olympic Games many new facilities were built, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was then enlarged and renewed to host several matches and the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup), the Stadio Flaminio, the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc. Rome made a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but it was withdrawn.[197][198]\n\n\nFurther, Rome hosted the 1991 EuroBasket and is home to the internationally recognised basketball team Virtus Roma. Rugby union is gaining wider acceptance. Until 2011 the Stadio Flaminio was the home stadium for the Italy national rugby union team, which has been playing in the Six Nations Championship since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety. Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as Rugby Roma (winner of five Italian championships), Unione Rugby Capitolina and S.S. Lazio 1927 (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).\n\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the ATP Masters Series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the Giro d'Italia three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Other local sports teams include volleyball (M. Roma Volley), handball or waterpolo.\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Rome\n\n![](image)Rome–Fiumicino Airport was the tenth busiest airport in Europe in 2016.\n![](image)Port of Civitavecchia\nRome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the Capitoline Hill and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the *Grande Raccordo Anulare* or *GRA*).\n\n\nDue to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, Termini, is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, Roma Tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed rail terminus.[199] As well as frequent high-speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna.\n\n\nRome is served by three airports. The intercontinental Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, Italy's chief airport is located in the nearby Fiumicino, south-west of Rome. The older Rome Ciampino Airport is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as \"Ciampino Airport\", as it is located beside Ciampino, south-east of Rome. A third airport, the Roma-Urbe Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights. The main airport system of the city (composed of Fiumicino and Ciampino), with 32.8 million passengers transported in 2022, is the second busiest airport system in Italy.[200]\n\n\nAlthough the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea (Lido di Ostia), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is Port of Civitavecchia, located about 62 km (39 mi) northwest of the city.[201]\n\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.[202] Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during daylight hours. Areas, where these restrictions apply, are known as Limited Traffic Zones (*Zona a Traffico Limitato* (ZTL)). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016\n![](image)Conca d'Oro metro station\nA three-line metro system called the *Metropolitana* operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s.[203] The line had been planned to quickly connect the main railway station with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where 1942 the World Fair was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed Esposizione Universale Roma in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500 million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of 3.9 km (2 mi).\n\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3 billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of 25.5 km (16 mi). It will partly replace the existing Termini-Pantano rail line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.[204] The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.[205] The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.\n\n\nA fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of 20 km (12 mi). The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis, the project has been put on hold.\n\n\nAbove-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39 km (24 mi) of track and 192 stops.[206] There are also trolleybuses.[207]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![flag](image)EU portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Outline of Rome\n* SPQR\n* Tourism in Italy\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also the Vatican City\n2. **^** This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus.

It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special *comune* named *Comune di Roma Capitale*. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[2] Rome is the country's most populated *comune* and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[3] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[4] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[5] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and also as the \"Eternal City\".[6] Rome is generally considered to be the \"cradle of Western civilization and Christian culture\", and the centre of the Catholic Church.[7][8][9]\n\n\nRome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.[10] The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis.[11] It was first called *The Eternal City* (Latin: *Urbs Aeterna*; Italian: *La Città Eterna*) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.[12][13] Rome is also called \"Caput Mundi\" (Capital of the World). \n\n\nAfter the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447–1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world.[14] In this way, Rome first became one of the major centres of the Renaissance[15] and then became the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors, and architects made Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In 1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became the Italian Republic.\n\n\nIn 2019, Rome was the 14th most visited city in the world, with 8.6 million tourists, the third most visited city in the European Union, and the most popular tourist destination in Italy.[16] Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.[17] The host city for the 1960 Summer Olympics, Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean[18] (UfM) as well as the headquarters of many multinational companies, such as Eni, Enel, TIM, Leonardo, and banks such as BNL. Numerous companies are based within Rome's EUR business district, such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana. The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design, and the Cinecittà Studios have been the set of many Academy Award–winning movies.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Name and symbol[edit]\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Ancient Romans' founding myth,[20] the name *Roma* came from the city's founder and first king, Romulus.[1]\n\n\nHowever, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.[21] As early as the 4th century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name *Roma*. Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:[22]\n\n\n\n* From *Rumon* or *Rumen*, archaic name of the Tiber, which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb ῥέω (*rhéō*) 'to flow, stream' and the Latin verb *ruō* 'to hurry, rush';[b]\n* From the Etruscan word 𐌓𐌖𐌌𐌀 (*ruma*), whose root is *\\*rum-* \"teat\", with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus, or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills;\n* From the Greek word ῥώμη (*rhṓmē*), which means *strength*.[c]\n\n\n### Other names and symbols[edit]\n\n\nRome has also been called in ancient times simply \"Urbs\" (central city),[23] from *urbs roma*, or identified with its ancient Roman symbol of SPQR, the symbol of its in Rome constituted republican government. Furthermore Rome has been called Urbs Aeterna (The Eternal City), Caput Mundi (The Capital of the world), Throne of St. Peter and Roma Capitale.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Rome\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Rome.\n\n### Earliest history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Founding of Rome\n\nHistorical States\n\n\n> \n> Roman Kingdom 753–509 BC  \n> \n> Roman Republic 509–27 BC  \n> \n> Roman Empire 27 BC– 395 AD  \n> \n> Western Roman Empire 286–476  \n> \n> Kingdom of Italy 476–493  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 493–536  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 536–546  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 546–547  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 547–549  \n> \n> Ostrogothic Kingdom 549–552  \n> \n> ![](image) Eastern Roman Empire 552–751  \n> \n> Kingdom of the Lombards 751–756  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 756–1798  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1798–1799  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1799–1809  \n> \n> ![](image) First French Empire 1809–1814  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1814–1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Roman Republic 1849  \n> \n> ![](image) Papal States 1849–1870  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1870–1943  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Social Republic 1943–1944  \n> \n> ![](image) Kingdom of Italy 1944–1946  \n> \n> ![](image) Italian Republic 1946–present  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nWhile there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately 14,000 years ago, the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.[10] Evidence of stone tools, pottery, and stone weapons attest to about 10,000 years of human presence. Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum. Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age, each hill between the sea and the Capitoline Hill was topped by a village (on the Capitoline, a village is attested since the end of the 14th century BC).[24] However, none of them yet had an urban quality.[24] Nowadays, there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation (\"synoecism\") of several villages around the largest one, placed above the Palatine.[24] This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level, which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities. These, in turn, boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy (mainly Ischia and Cumae).[24] These developments, which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid-eighth century BC, can be considered as the \"birth\" of the city.[24] Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill, the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC, as the legend of Romulus suggests, remains a fringe hypothesis.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Legend of the founding of Rome[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Romulus and Remus and Romulus\n\n![](image)*Capitoline Wolf*, a sculpture of the mythical she-wolf suckling the infant twins Romulus and Remus\nTraditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, the twins who were suckled by a she-wolf.[20] They decided to build a city, but after an argument, Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name. According to the Roman annalists, this happened on 21 April 753 BC.[26] This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition, set earlier in time, that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus, the namesake of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.[27]\nThis was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC. In addition, Strabo mentions an older story, that the city was an Arcadian colony founded by Evander. Strabo also writes that Lucius Coelius Antipater believed that Rome was founded by Greeks.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### Monarchy and republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancient Rome, Roman Kingdom, and Roman Republic\n\n![](image)The Temple of Portunus, god of grain storage, keys, livestock and ports.[30] Rome, built between 120 and 80 BC\n![](image)The Roman Forum are the remains of those buildings that during most of ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic centre of the city and the neuralgic centre of all the Roman civilisation.[31]\nAfter the foundation by Romulus according to a legend,[26] Rome was ruled for a period of 244 years by a monarchical system, initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: Romulus, Numa Pompilius, Tullus Hostilius, Ancus Marcius, Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.[26]\n\n\nIn 509 BC, the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic. Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, Volsci, Aequi, and Marsi.[32] After becoming master of Latium, Rome led several wars (against the Gauls, Osci-Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto, allied with Pyrrhus, king of Epirus) whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula, from the central area up to Magna Graecia.[33]\n\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the Balkans, through the three Punic Wars (264–146 BC) fought against the city of Carthage and the three Macedonian Wars (212–168 BC) against Macedonia.[34] The first Roman provinces were established at this time: Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Hispania, Macedonia, Achaea and Africa.[35]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the optimates, representing the conservative part of the Senate, and the populares, which relied on the help of the plebs (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic. Because of this, in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally: after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus,[36] and the war against Jugurtha,[36] there was a civil war from which the general Sulla emerged victorious.[36] A major slave revolt under Spartacus followed,[37] and then the establishment of the first Triumvirate with Caesar, Pompey and Crassus.[37]\n\n\nThe conquest of Gaul made Caesar immensely powerful and popular, which led to a second civil war against the Senate and Pompey. After his victory, Caesar established himself as dictator for life.[37] His assassination led to a second Triumvirate among Octavian (Caesar's grandnephew and heir), Mark Antony and Lepidus, and to another civil war between Octavian and Antony.[38]\n\n\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Ancient-Imperial-Roman palaces of the Palatine, a series of palaces located in the Palatine Hill, express power and wealth of emperors from Augustus until the 4th century.\n![](image)The Imperial fora belong to a series of *monumental fora* (public squares) constructed in Rome by the emperors. Also seen in the image is Trajan's Market.\n![](image)The Temple of Claudius to the south (left) of the Colosseum (model of Imperial Rome at the Museo della civiltà romana in Rome)\nIn 27 BC, Octavian became *princeps civitatis* and took the title of Augustus, founding the principate, a diarchy between the *princeps* and the senate.[38] During the reign of Nero, two thirds of the city was ruined after the Great Fire of Rome, and the persecution of Christians commenced.[39][40][41] Rome was established as a de facto empire, which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor Trajan. Rome was confirmed as caput Mundi, i.e. the capital of the known world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the Julio-Claudian,[42] Flavian (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the Colosseum),[42] and Antonine dynasties.[43] This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by Jesus Christ in Judea in the first half of the first century (under Tiberius) and popularised by his apostles through the empire and beyond.[44] The Antonine age is considered the zenith of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates and from Britain to Egypt.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Colosseum at night\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into a 50-year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260 to 274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions – Britain, Spain, and North Africa – were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s–280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The Persian Empire invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.[45] Emperor Diocletian (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the Tetrarchy which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level: whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed price controls which did not last. He or Constantine regionalised the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Vérone et la province de Grande-Arménie, Mélanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in Nicomedia. In 296, he elevated Maximian to *Augustus* of the western half, where he ruled mostly from Mediolanum when not on the move.[45] In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in Trier and Galerius in Sirmium in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they, in turn, appointed two colleagues for themselves.[45]\n\n\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306–313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325–330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called Edict of Milan of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence, which, however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; Constantinople.[46]\n\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the Edict of Thessalonica issued in the name of three emperors – Gratian, Valentinian II, and Theodosius I – with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, Arcadius and Honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to Ravenna in 408, but from 450 the emperors mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Visigoths sacking Rome in 410, by Joseph-Noël Sylvestre (1890), the first time in c. 800 years that Rome had fallen to a foreign enemy\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, was sacked in 410 by the Visigoths led by Alaric I,[48] but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450–500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by Genseric, king of the Vandals.[49] The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of Romulus Augustus on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the Middle Ages.[46]\n\n\nThe decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443, and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised.[50]\n\n\nHowever, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. The population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, the population dropped to 30,000 but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.[51] The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.[52] The figure of 450,000–500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.[53] Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n\n\n### Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fall of the Western Roman Empire\n\n![](image)The Vandals sacking Rome in 455, by Karl Briullov (1830s)\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War, which devastated the city in 546 and 550. Its population declined from more than a million in 210 AD to 500,000 in 273[54] to 35,000 after the Gothic War (535–554),[55] reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins, vegetation, vineyards and market gardens.[56] It is generally thought the population of the city until 300 AD was 1 million (estimates range from 2 million to 750,000) declining to 750–800,000 in 400 AD, 450–500,000 in 450 AD and down to 80–100,000 in 500 AD (though it may have been twice this).[57]\n\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the Pope, was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there. The Bishops of Rome were also seen (and still are seen by Catholics) as the successors of Peter, who is considered the first Bishop of Rome. The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church.\n\n\nAfter the Lombard invasion of Italy (569–572), the city remained nominally Byzantine, but in reality, the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the Byzantines, the Franks, and the Lombards.[58] In 729, the Lombard king Liutprand donated the north Latium town of Sutri to the Church, starting its temporal power.[58] In 756, Pepin the Short, after having defeated the Lombards, gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the Exarchate of Ravenna, thus creating the Papal States.[58] Since this period, three powers tried to rule the city: the pope, the nobility (together with the chiefs of militias, the judges, the Senate and the populace), and the Frankish king, as king of the Lombards, patricius, and Emperor.[58] These three parties (theocratic, republican, and imperial) were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages.[58] On Christmas night of 800, Charlemagne was crowned in Rome as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III: on that occasion, the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages.[58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail view on an illustration by Raphael portraying the crowning of Charlemagne in Old Saint Peter's Basilica, on 25 December 800\nIn 846, Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city's walls, but managed to loot St. Peter's and St. Paul's basilica, both outside the city wall.[59] After the decay of Carolingian power, Rome fell prey to feudal chaos: several noble families fought against the pope, the emperor, and each other. These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia, concubines and mothers of several popes, and of Crescentius, a powerful feudal lord, who fought against the Emperors Otto II and Otto III.[60] The scandals of this period forced the papacy to reform itself: the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals, and reform of the clergy was attempted. The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana, who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became involved into the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV.[60] Subsequently, Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans under Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in Castel Sant'Angelo.[60]\n\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a *senatore* or *patrizio*. In the 12th century, this administration, like other European cities, evolved into the commune, a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes.[60] Pope Lucius II fought against the Roman commune, and the struggle was continued by his successor Pope Eugenius III: by this stage, the commune, allied with the aristocracy, was supported by Arnaldo da Brescia, a monk who was a religious and social reformer.[61] After the pope's death, Arnaldo was taken prisoner by Adrianus IV, which marked the end of the commune's autonomy.[61] Under Pope Innocent III, whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy, the commune liquidated the senate, and replaced it with a *Senatore*, who was subject to the pope.[61]\n\n\nIn this period, the papacy played a role of secular importance in Western Europe, often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers.[62][63][64]\n\n\nIn 1266, Charles of Anjou, who was heading south to fight the Hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope, was appointed Senator. Charles founded the Sapienza, the university of Rome.[61] In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in Viterbo, could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the conclave.[61] In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: Annibaldi, Caetani, Colonna, Orsini, Conti, nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pope Gregory XI returned to Rome in 1376 and ended the Avignon Papacy.\nPope Boniface VIII, born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's universal domain; he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna family and, in 1300, called for the first Jubilee of Christianity, which brought millions of pilgrims to Rome.[61] However, his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair, who took him prisoner and killed him in Anagni.[61] Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377).[65] During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, Cola di Rienzo, came to power.[65] An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of *Tribuno*, his reforms were rejected by the populace.[65] Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal Albornoz, who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.[65] Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under Gregory XI.[65] The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the Western Schism (1377–1418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.[65]\n\n\n\n### Early modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Renaissance\n\n![](image)Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by Mario Cartaro (from 1575) shows the city's primary monuments.\n![](image)Castel Sant'Angelo, or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia was created by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1629.\nIn 1418, the Council of Constance settled the Western Schism, and a Roman pope, Martin V, was elected.[65] This brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the Renaissance.[65] The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from Nicholas V, founder of the Vatican Library, to Pius II, humanist and literate, from Sixtus IV, a warrior pope, to Alexander VI, immoral and nepotist, from Julius II, soldier and patron, to Leo X, who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.[65]\n\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the Italian Renaissance moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new Saint Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel and *Ponte Sisto* (the first bridge to be built across the Tiber since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the Popes engaged the best artists of the time, including Michelangelo, Perugino, Raphael, Ghirlandaio, Luca Signorelli, Botticelli, and Cosimo Rosselli.\n\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many Popes fathering children, and engaging in nepotism and simony. The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the Reformation and, in turn, the Counter-Reformation. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the Pietà by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartments. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II (1503–1513) and his successors Leo X and Clement VII, both members of the Medici family.\n\n\n\n![](image)Carnival in Rome, c. 1650, by Johannes Lingelbach\n![](image)*A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome*, by Hendrik Frans van Lint, c. 1730\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world. The old St. Peter's Basilica built by Emperor Constantine the Great[66] (which by then was in a dilapidated state) was demolished and a new one begun. The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Botticelli and Bramante, who built the temple of San Pietro in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the Villa Farnesina, the Raphael's Rooms, plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb of Julius II.\n\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including Agostino Chigi, who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The War of the League of Cognac caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since the previous sack; in 1527, the Landsknechts of Emperor Charles V sacked the city, bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.[65]\n\n\nBeginning with the Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.[65] Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V, Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.[67] The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.[67]\n\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families (Barberini, Pamphili, Chigi, Rospigliosi, Altieri, Odescalchi) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.[67] During the Age of Enlightenment, new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.[65] But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed.[65]\n\n\n\n### Late modern and contemporary[edit]\n\n\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived Roman Republic (1798–1800), which was established under the influence of the French Revolution. The Papal States were restored in June 1800, but during Napoleon's reign Rome was annexed as a *Département* of the French Empire: first as *Département du Tibre* (1808–1810) and then as *Département Rome* (1810–1814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the Congress of Vienna of 1814.\n\n\nIn 1849, a second Roman Republic was proclaimed during a year of revolutions in 1848. Two of the most influential figures of the Italian unification, Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, fought for the short-lived republic.\n\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 with the temporary capital in Florence. That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of Napoleon III. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. In 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia. Pope Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.[68] In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bombardment of Rome by Allied planes, 1943\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of Italian Fascism led by Benito Mussolini, who led a march on the city. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.[69] The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943, the San Lorenzo district was subject to Allied bombing raids, resulting in about 3,000 fatalities and 11,000 injuries, of whom another 1,500 died.[70] Mussolini was arrested on 25 July 1943. On the date of the Italian Armistice 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an open city. It was liberated on 4 June 1944.\n\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"Italian economic miracle\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of *la dolce vita* (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as *Ben Hur*, *Quo Vadis*, *Roman Holiday* and *La Dolce Vita* filmed in the city's iconic Cinecittà Studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s when the *comune* had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Rome\nRome is in the Lazio region of central Italy on the Tiber (Italian: *Tevere*) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island, the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the Aventine Hill, the Caelian Hill, the Capitoline Hill, the Esquiline Hill, the Palatine Hill, the Quirinal Hill, and the Viminal Hill. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the Aniene, which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\n\nAlthough the city centre is about 24 km (15 mi) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of Ostia is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from 13 m (43 ft) above sea level (at the base of the Pantheon) to 139 m (456 ft) above sea level (the peak of Monte Mario).[71] The *Comune* of Rome covers an overall area of about 1,285 km2 (496 sq mi), including many green areas.\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of parks and gardens in Rome\n\n![](image)The Temple of Aesculapius, in the Villa Borghese gardens\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.[72] The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are the Villa Borghese, Villa Ada, and Villa Doria Pamphili. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill, comprising some 1.8 km2 (0.7 sq mi). The Villa Sciarra is on the hill, with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere, the Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana, close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of Pincio and Villa Medici. There is also a notable pine wood at Castelfusano, near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin, including the Pineto Regional Park and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Rome\n\n![](image)Stone pines in the Villa Doria Pamphili\nRome has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*),[73] with hot, dry summers and mild, humid winters.\n\n\nIts average annual temperature is above 21 °C (70 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. In the coldest month, January, the average temperature is 12.6 °C (54.7 °F) during the day and 2.1 °C (35.8 °F) at night. In the warmest month, August, the average temperature is 31.7 °C (89.1 °F) during the day and 17.3 °C (63.1 °F) at night.\n\n\nDecember, January and February are the coldest months, with a daily mean temperature of approximately 8 °C (46 °F). Temperatures during these months generally vary between 10 and 15 °C (50 and 59 °F) during the day and between 3 and 5 °C (37 and 41 °F) at night, with colder or warmer spells occurring frequently. Snowfall is rare but not unheard of, with light snow or flurries occurring on some winters, generally without accumulation, and major snowfalls on a very rare occurrence (the most recent ones were in 2018, 2012 and 1986).[74][75][76]\n\n\nThe average relative humidity is 75%, varying from 72% in July to 77% in November. Sea temperatures vary from a low of 13.9 °C (57.0 °F) in February to a high of 25.0 °C (77.0 °F) in August.[77]\n\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Rome was 42.9 °C (109.2 °F) on 18 July 2023.[78]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rome Ciampino Airport, elevation: 129 m or 423 ft, 1991-2020 normals, extremes 1944–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 39.7(103.5)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 40.0(104.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −2.4(27.7)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 4.3(39.7)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −6.6(20.1)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 65.6(2.58)\n | 62.8(2.47)\n | 58.6(2.31)\n | 68.6(2.70)\n | 56.9(2.24)\n | 30.1(1.19)\n | 19.8(0.78)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 64.9(2.56)\n | 88.1(3.47)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 98.3(3.87)\n | 752.0(29.61)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.40\n | 7.48\n | 6.85\n | 7.42\n | 5.54\n | 3.38\n | 2.16\n | 2.20\n | 6.00\n | 7.32\n | 8.84\n | 9.44\n | 74.03\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 75.8\n | 71.5\n | 70.6\n | 70.4\n | 69.0\n | 65.4\n | 63.3\n | 64.1\n | 69.1\n | 74.0\n | 77.9\n | 77.2\n | 70.7\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 155.9\n | 171.9\n | 203.1\n | 221.1\n | 276.5\n | 298.8\n | 337.6\n | 320.2\n | 237.9\n | 200.6\n | 153.3\n | 146.9\n | 2,723.9\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[79] |\n| Source 2: Temperature estreme in Toscana[80] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographics of Italy\n\n![](image)Rome (comune) age-sex pyramid in 2022\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 194,500 | —     |\n| 1871  | 212,432 | +9.2% |\n| 1881  | 273,952 | +29.0% |\n| 1901  | 422,411 | +54.2% |\n| 1911  | 518,917 | +22.8% |\n| 1921  | 660,235 | +27.2% |\n| 1931  | 930,926 | +41.0% |\n| 1936  | 1,150,589 | +23.6% |\n| 1951  | 1,651,754 | +43.6% |\n| 1961  | 2,188,160 | +32.5% |\n| 1971  | 2,781,993 | +27.1% |\n| 1981  | 2,840,259 | +2.1% |\n| 1991  | 2,775,250 | −2.3% |\n| 2001  | 2,663,182 | −4.0% |\n| 2011  | 2,617,175 | −1.7% |\n| 2021  | 2,770,226 | +5.8% |\n| Source: ISTAT, 2022 |\n\n\nIn 550 BC, Rome was the second largest city in Italy, with Tarentum being the largest.[*citation needed*] It had an area of about 285 ha (700 acres) and an estimated population of 35,000. Other sources suggest the population was just under 100,000 from 600 to 500 BC.[81][82] When the Republic was founded in 509 BC the census recorded a population of 130,000.[83] The republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings. Other sources suggest a population of 150,000 in 500 BC. It surpassed 300,000 in 150 BC.[84][85][86][87][88]\n\n\nThe size of the city at the time of the Emperor Augustus is a matter of speculation, with estimates based on grain distribution, grain imports, aqueduct capacity, city limits, population density, census reports, and assumptions about the number of unreported women, children and slaves providing a very wide range. Glenn Storey estimates 450,000 people, Whitney Oates estimates 1.2 million, Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of 800,000 and excludes earlier suggestions of 2 million.[89][90][91][92] Estimates of the city's population towards and after the end of the Roman empire also vary. A.H.M. Jones estimated the population at 650,000 in the mid-fifth century. The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated. The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward, although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire.[93] According to Krautheimer it was still close to 800,000 in 400 AD; had declined to 500,000 by 452, and dwindled to perhaps 100,000 in 500 AD. After the Gothic Wars, 535–552, the population may have dwindled temporarily to 30,000. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory I (590–604), it may have reached 90,000, augmented by refugees.[94] Lancon estimates 500,000 based on the number of 'incisi' enrolled as eligible to receive bread, oil and wine rations; the number fell to 120,000 in the reform of 419.[95] Neil Christie, citing free rations for the poorest, estimated 500,000 in the mid-fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century.[96] Novel 36 of Emperor Valentinian III records 3.629 million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at 5 lbs. per month for the five winter months, sufficient for 145,000 recipients. This has been used to suggest a population of just under 500,000. Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in 439 by the Vandals, and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while. The city's population declined to less than 50,000 people in the Early Middle Ages from 700 AD onward. It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance.[97]\n\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in 1870, the city had a population of about 225,000. Less than half the city within the walls was built up in 1881 when the population recorded was 275,000. This increased to 600,000 by the eve of World War I. The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early 1930s.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*] Population growth continued after the Second World War, helped by a post-war economic boom. A construction boom also created many suburbs during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nIn mid-2010, there were 2,754,440 residents in the city proper, while some 4.2 million people lived in the greater Rome area (which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city, with a population density of about 800 inhabitants/km2 stretching over more than 5,000 km2 (1,900 sq mi)). Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 17.00% of the population compared to pensioners who number 20.76%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of a Roman resident is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Rome grew by 6.54%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.56%.[98] The current[*when?*] birth rate of Rome is 9.10 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.9 million.[99] Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in the Rome metropolitan area.[100][101][102][103][104]\n\n\n\n### Origin groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Esquilino *rione*\nAccording to the latest statistics conducted by ISTAT,[105] approximately 9.5% of the population consists of non-Italians. About half of the immigrant population consists of those of various other European origins (chiefly Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian, and Albanian) numbering a combined total of 131,118 or 4.7% of the population. The remaining 4.8% are those with non-European origins, chiefly Filipinos (26,933), Bangladeshis (12,154), and Chinese (10,283).\n\n\nThe Esquilino *rione*, off Termini Railway Station, has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood. It is perceived as Rome's Chinatown. Immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there. A commercial district, Esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine. There are wholesale clothes shops. Of the 1,300 or so commercial premises operating in the district 800 are Chinese-owned; around 300 are run by immigrants from other countries around the world; 200 are owned by Italians.[106]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Roman dialect and Latin\n\n![](image)Advertisement in Romanesco dialect at a subway station in Rome\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive, however. Through the process of Romanization, the peoples of Italy, Gallia, the Iberian Peninsula and Dacia developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonisation and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the Norman Conquest, borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.[107]\n\n\nThe medieval Roman dialect belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects, and was thus much closer to the Neapolitan language than to the Florentine.[108][109] A typical example of Romanesco of that period is *Vita di Cola di Rienzo [it]* (\"Life of Cola di Rienzo\"), written by an anonymous Roman during the 14th century.[108] Starting with the 16th century, the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the Tuscan dialect (from which modern Italian derives) starting with the reigns of the two Medici popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and with the Sack of Rome in 1527, two events which provoked a large immigration from Tuscany.[110][111] Therefore, current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy.[111]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Rome\n\nSee also: Vatican City\n\n![](image)Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome's Cathedral, built in 324, and partly rebuilt between 1660 and 1734\n![](image)Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and the largest Catholic Marian church in Rome\nMuch like the rest of Italy, Rome is predominantly Christian, and the city has been an important centre of religion and pilgrimage for centuries, the base of the ancient Roman religion with the pontifex maximus and later the seat of the Vatican and the pope. Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the Religio Romana (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were Jupiter, the Most High, and Mars, the god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, Romulus and Remus, according to tradition. Other deities such as Vesta and Minerva were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as Mithraism. Later, after St Peter and St Paul were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the Old St. Peter's Basilica was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the Avignon papacy), Rome has for centuries been the home of the Roman Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, otherwise known as the Pope.\n\n\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the Vatican City and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls, the Basilica di San Clemente, San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane and the Church of the Gesù. There are also the ancient Catacombs of Rome underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the Pontifical Lateran University, Pontifical Biblical Institute, Pontifical Gregorian University, and Pontifical Oriental Institute.\n\n\nSince the end of the Roman Republic, Rome is also the centre of an important Jewish community,[112] which was once based in Trastevere, and later in the Roman Ghetto. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the *Tempio Maggiore*.\n\n\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the *Mons Vaticanus* (Vatican Hill), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman rione of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the Tiber, the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV, later expanded by the current fortification walls of Paul III, Pius IV, and Urban VIII. When the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. \n\n\nRome has been a major Christian pilgrimage site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the Christian world visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The city became a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the Middle Ages, Rome kept its status as Papal capital and holy city for centuries, even when the Papacy briefly relocated to Avignon (1309–1377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter. Pilgrimages to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the Pilate's stairs: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the praetorium of Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem, which Jesus Christ stood on during his Passion on his way to trial.[113]\n\n\n\n![Panorama of St. Peter's Square](image)\nSt. Peter's Square in Vatican City\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Rome, City Council of Rome, Elections in Rome, and Administrative subdivisions of Rome\n\n![](image)Current seat of the Mayor of Rome, *Palazzo Senatorio* on Capitoline Hill.\n![](image)The Palazzo del Quirinale, now seat of the President of the Italian Republic\nRome constitutes a comune *speciale*, named *\"Roma Capitale\"*,[114] and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 *comuni* of Italy. It is governed by a mayor and a city council. The seat of the *comune* is the *Palazzo Senatorio* on the Capitoline Hill, the historic seat of the city government. The local administration in Rome is commonly referred to as *\"Campidoglio\"*, the Italian name of the hill.\n\n\nSince 1972, the city has been divided into administrative areas, called *municipi* (sing. *municipio*) (until 2001 named *circoscrizioni*).[115] They were created for administrative reasons to increase decentralisation in the city. Each *municipio* is governed by a president and a council of twenty-five members who are elected by its residents every five years. The *municipi* frequently cross the boundaries of the traditional, non-administrative divisions of the city. The municipi were originally 20, then 19,[116] and in 2013, their number was reduced to 15.[117]\n\n\nRome is also divided into differing types of non-administrative units. The historic centre is divided into 22 *rioni*, all of which are located within the Aurelian Walls except Prati and Borgo. These originate from the 14 regions of Augustan Rome, which evolved in the Middle Ages into the medieval rioni.[118] In the Renaissance, under Pope Sixtus V, they again reached fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under Pope Benedict XIV in 1743.\n\n\nRome is the principal town of the Metropolitan City of Rome, operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old provincia di Roma, which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until Civitavecchia. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At 5,352 km2 (2,066 sq mi), its dimensions are comparable to the region of Liguria. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the Lazio region.[119]\n\n\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the Italian Government. The official residences of the President of the Italian Republic and the Italian Prime Minister, the seats of both houses of the Italian Parliament and that of the Italian Constitutional Court are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in Palazzo della Farnesina near the Olympic stadium.\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FAO headquarters in Rome, Circo Massimo\nAmong the global cities, Rome is unique in having two sovereign entities located entirely within its city limits, the Holy See, represented by the Vatican City State, and the territorially smaller Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian capital city and a sovereign possession of the Holy See, which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[120][121] Rome is the seat of the so-called \"Polo Romano\" made up by three main international agencies of the United Nations: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).[122]\n\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The Treaties of the EU are located in Palazzo della Farnesina. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (predecessor to the European Union), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed European Constitution in July 2004. Rome is the seat of the European Olympic Committee and of the NATO Defense College. The city is the place where the Statute of the International Criminal Court and the European Convention on Human Rights were formulated. The city hosts also other important international entities such as the IDLO (International Development Law Organisation), the ICCROM (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the UNIDROIT (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n\n\n#### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Italy\n\nSince 9 April 1956, Rome is exclusively and reciprocally twinned only with:\n\n\n\n* ![France](image) Paris, France, 1956\n\n\n*Solo Parigi è degna di Roma; solo Roma è degna di Parigi.* (in Italian)\n*Seule Paris est digne de Rome; seule Rome est digne de Paris.* (in French)\n\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\"[123][124][125][126][127]\nRome's other partner cities are:[128]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Achacachi, Bolivia[128]\n* ![](image) Algiers, Algeria[128]\n* ![](image) Beijing, China[129][130]\n* ![](image) Belgrade, Serbia[128]\n* ![](image) Brasília, Brazil[128]\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina[128]\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt[128]\n* ![](image) Cincinnati, United States[128]\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine[128]\n* ![](image) Kobanî, Syria[131]\n* ![](image) Kraków, Poland[132]\n* ![](image) Madrid, Spain[133]\n* ![](image) Multan, Pakistan[134]\n* ![](image) New Delhi, India[128]\n* ![](image) New York City, United States[135]\n* ![](image) Plovdiv, Bulgaria[128]\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea[136][137]\n* ![](image) Sydney, Australia[128]\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania[138][139]\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran[128]\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan[140]\n* ![](image) Tongeren, Belgium[128]\n* ![](image) Tunis, Tunisia[141]\n* ![](image) Washington, D.C., United States[142]\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Rome\n\n![](image)Palazzo Eni, in the EUR business district, headquarters of Eni, considered one of the world's oil and gas \"supermajors\".[143]\n![](image)Enel's headquarters in Rome, the second largest power company in the world by revenue after the State Grid Corporation of China.[144]\n![](image)Orizzonte Europa, BNL headquarters in Rome\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single *Ministeri*), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City. Many international institutions are located in Rome, notably cultural and scientific ones, such as the American Institute, the British School, the French Academy, the Scandinavian Institutes, and the German Archaeological Institute. There are also specialised agencies of the United Nations, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Rome also hosts major international and worldwide political and cultural organisations, such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), World Food Programme (WFP), the NATO Defence College, and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM).\n\n\nAccording to the GaWC study of world cities, Rome is a \"Beta +\" city.[145] The city was ranked in 2014 as 32nd in the Global Cities Index, the highest in Italy.[146] With a 2005 GDP of €94.376 billion (US$121.5 billion),[147][*needs update*] the city produces 6.7% of the national GDP (more than any other single city in Italy), and its unemployment rate, lowered from 11.1% to 6.5% between 2001 and 2005, is now one of the lowest rates of all the European Union capital cities.[147] Rome's economy grows at around 4.4% annually and continues to grow at a higher rate in comparison to any other city in the rest of the country.[147] This means that were Rome a country, it would be the world's 52nd richest country by GDP, near to the size to that of Egypt. Rome also had a 2003 GDP per capita of €29,153 (US$37,412), which was second in Italy (after Milan), and is more than 134.1% of the EU average GDP per capita.[148][*needs update*] Rome, on the whole, has the highest total earnings in Italy, reaching €47,076,890,463 in 2008,[149][*needs update*] yet, in terms of average workers' incomes, the city places itself 9th in Italy, with €24,509.[149] On a global level, Rome's workers receive the 30th highest wages in 2009, coming three places higher than in 2008, in which the city ranked 33rd.[150][*needs update*] The Rome area had a GDP amounting to $167.8 billion, and $38,765 per capita.[151]\n\n\nAlthough the economy of Rome is characterised by the absence of heavy industry, and it is largely dominated by services, high-technology companies (IT, aerospace, defence, telecommunications), research, construction and commercial activities (especially banking), and the huge development of tourism are very dynamic and extremely important to its economy. Rome's international airport, Fiumicino, is the largest in Italy, and the city hosts the head offices of the vast majority of the major Italian companies, as well as the headquarters of three of the world's 100 largest companies: Enel, Eni, and Telecom Italia.[152]\n\n\nUniversities, national radio and television and the movie industry in Rome are also important parts of the economy: Rome is also the hub of the Italian film industry, thanks to the Cinecittà studios, working since the 1930s. The city is also a centre for banking and insurance as well as electronics, energy, transport, and aerospace industries. Numerous international companies and agencies headquarters, government ministries, conference centres, sports venues, and museums are located in Rome's principal business districts: the Esposizione Universale Roma (EUR); the *Torrino* (further south from the EUR); the *Magliana*; the *Parco de' Medici-Laurentina* and the so-called *Tiburtina-valley* along the ancient Via Tiburtina.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tourism in Rome and List of tourist attractions in Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana della Barcaccia in Piazza di Spagna, the Spanish Steps and Trinità dei Monti\n![](image)Piazza Navona\n![](image)The Vatican Museums are the 8th most visited art museum in the world (2021).[153]\nRome today is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world, due to the incalculable immensity of its archaeological and artistic treasures, as well as for the charm of its unique traditions, the beauty of its panoramic views, and the majesty of its magnificent \"villas\" (parks). Among the most significant resources are the many museums – Capitoline Museums, the Vatican Museums and the Galleria Borghese and others dedicated to modern and contemporary art – aqueducts, fountains, churches, palaces, historical buildings, the monuments and ruins of the Roman Forum, and the Catacombs. Rome is the third most visited city in the EU, after London and Paris, and receives an average of 7–10 million tourists a year, which sometimes doubles on holy years. The Colosseum (4 million tourists) and the Vatican Museums (4.2 million tourists) are the 39th and 37th (respectively) most visited places in the world, according to a recent study.[154]\n\n\nRome is a major archaeological hub, and one of the world's main centres of archaeological research. There are numerous cultural and research institutes located in the city, such as the American Academy in Rome,[155] and The Swedish Institute at Rome.[156] Rome contains numerous ancient sites, including the Forum Romanum, Trajan's Market, Trajan's Forum,[157] the Colosseum, and the Pantheon, to name but a few. The Colosseum, arguably one of Rome's most iconic archaeological sites, is regarded as a wonder of the world.[158][159]\n\n\nRome contains a vast collection of art, sculpture, fountains, mosaics, frescos, and paintings, from all different periods. Rome first became a major artistic centre during ancient Rome, with forms of important Roman art such as architecture, painting, sculpture and mosaic work. Metal-work, coin die and gem engraving, ivory carvings, figurine glass, pottery, and book illustrations are considered to be 'minor' forms of Roman artwork.[160] Rome later became a major centre of Renaissance art, since the popes spent vast sums of money for the constructions of grandiose basilicas, palaces, piazzas and public buildings in general. Rome became one of Europe's major centres of Renaissance artwork, second only to Florence, and able to compare to other major cities and cultural centres, such as Paris and Venice. The city was affected greatly by the baroque, and Rome became the home of numerous artists and architects, such as Bernini, Caravaggio, Carracci, Borromini and Cortona.[161] In the late 18th century and early 19th century, the city was one of the centres of the Grand Tour,[162] when wealthy, young English and other European aristocrats visited the city to learn about ancient Roman culture, art, philosophy, and architecture. Rome hosted a great number of neoclassical and rococo artists, such as Pannini and Bernardo Bellotto. Today, the city is a major artistic centre, with numerous art institutes[163] and museums.\n\n\nRome has a growing stock of contemporary and modern art and architecture. The National Gallery of Modern Art has works by Balla, Morandi, Pirandello, Carrà, De Chirico, De Pisis, Guttuso, Fontana, Burri, Mastroianni, Turcato, Kandisky, and Cézanne on permanent exhibition. 2010 saw the opening of Rome's newest arts foundation, a contemporary art and architecture gallery designed by acclaimed Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. Known as MAXXI – National Museum of the 21st Century Arts it restores a dilapidated area with striking modern architecture. Maxxi[164] features a campus dedicated to culture, experimental research laboratories, international exchange and study and research. It is one of Rome's most ambitious modern architecture projects alongside Renzo Piano's Auditorium Parco della Musica[165] and Massimiliano Fuksas' Rome Convention Center, Centro Congressi Italia EUR, in the EUR district, due to open in 2016.[166] The convention centre features a huge translucent container inside which is suspended a steel and teflon structure resembling a cloud and which contains meeting rooms and an auditorium with two piazzas open to the neighbourhood on either side.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sapienza University of Rome, founded in 1303\nRome is a nationwide and major international centre for higher education, containing numerous academies, colleges and universities. It boasts a large variety of academies and colleges, and has always been a major worldwide intellectual and educational centre, especially during Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, along with Florence.[167] According to the City Brands Index, Rome is considered the world's second most historically, educationally and culturally interesting and beautiful city.[168]\n\n\nRome has many universities and colleges. Its first university, La Sapienza (founded in 1303), is one of the largest in the world, with more than 140,000 students attending; in 2005 it ranked as Europe's 33rd best university[169] and in 2013 the Sapienza University of Rome ranked as the 62nd in the world and the top in Italy in its *World University Rankings*.[170] and has been ranked among Europe's 50 and the world's 150 best colleges.[171] In order to decrease the overcrowding of La Sapienza, two new public universities were founded during the last decades: Tor Vergata in 1982, and Roma Tre in 1992. Rome hosts also the LUISS School of Government,[172] Italy's most important graduate university in the areas of international affairs and European studies as well as LUISS Business School, Italy's most important business school. Rome ISIA was founded in 1973 by Giulio Carlo Argan and is Italy's oldest institution in the field of industrial design.\n\n\n\n![](image)Biblioteca Casanatense\nRome contains many pontifical universities and other institutes, including the British School at Rome, the French School in Rome, the Pontifical Gregorian University (the oldest Jesuit university in the world, founded in 1551), Istituto Europeo di Design, the Scuola Lorenzo de' Medici, the Link Campus of Malta, and the Università Campus Bio-Medico. Rome is also the location of two American Universities; The American University of Rome[173] and John Cabot University as well as St. John's University branch campus, John Felice Rome Center, a campus of Loyola University Chicago and Temple University Rome, a campus of Temple University.[174] The Roman Colleges are several seminaries for students from foreign countries studying for the priesthood at the Pontifical Universities.[175] Examples include the Venerable English College, the Pontifical North American College, the Scots College, and the Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome.\nRome's major libraries include: the Biblioteca Angelica, opened in 1604, making it Italy's first public library; the Biblioteca Vallicelliana, established in 1565; the Biblioteca Casanatense, opened in 1701; the National Central Library, one of the two national libraries in Italy, which contains 4,126,002 volumes; The Biblioteca del Ministero degli Affari Esteri, specialised in diplomacy, foreign affairs and modern history; the Biblioteca dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana; the Biblioteca Don Bosco, one of the largest and most modern of all Salesian libraries; the Biblioteca e Museo teatrale del Burcardo, a museum-library specialised in history of drama and theatre; the Biblioteca della Società Geografica Italiana, which is based in the Villa Celimontana and is the most important geographical library in Italy, and one of Europe's most important;[176] and the Vatican Library, one of the oldest and most important libraries in the world, which was formally established in 1475, though in fact much older and has 75,000 codices, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. There are also many specialist libraries attached to various foreign cultural institutes in Rome, among them that of the American Academy in Rome, the French Academy in Rome and the Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute of Art History, a German library, often noted for excellence in the arts and sciences.[177]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture in Rome\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana in EUR district\nThis section is an excerpt from Architecture of Rome.[edit]\nThe architecture of Rome over the centuries has greatly developed from Ancient Roman architecture to Italian modern and contemporary architecture. Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture.[178] Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in style.\n\n#### Fountains and aqueducts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of fountains in Rome and List of aqueducts in the city of Rome\n\n![](image)The Trevi Fountain. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of Nicola Salvi.\nRome is a city known for its numerous fountains, built-in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had fountains for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the piazzas of Rome. During the Roman Empire, in 98 AD, according to Sextus Julius Frontinus, the Roman consul who was named *curator aquarum* or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine aqueducts which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.[179]\n\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other degraded Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of Rubens, were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. In these fountains, sculpture became the principal element, and the water was used simply to animate and decorate the sculptures. They, like baroque gardens, were \"a visual representation of confidence and power\".[180]\n\n\n\n#### Statues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Talking statues of Rome\n\n![](image)Fontana dei Fiumi by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1648\nRome is well known for its statues but, in particular, the talking statues of Rome. These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the Pasquino and the Marforio, yet there are four other noted ones: il Babuino, Madama Lucrezia, il Facchino and Abbot Luigi. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents Menelaus, Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be Silenus, Marforio represents Oceanus, Madama Lucrezia is a bust of Isis, and il Facchino is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or graffiti expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to Giordano Bruno in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n\n\n#### Obelisks and columns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of obelisks in Rome\n\n![](image)Flaminio Obelisk, Piazza del Popolo\nThe city hosts eight ancient Egyptian and five ancient Roman obelisks, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an ancient Ethiopian obelisk in Rome.[181] The city contains some of obelisks in piazzas, such as in Piazza Navona, St Peter's Square, Piazza Montecitorio, and Piazza del Popolo, and others in villas, thermae parks and gardens, such as in Villa Celimontana, the Baths of Diocletian, and the Pincian Hill. Moreover, the centre of Rome hosts also Trajan's and Antonine Column, two ancient Roman columns with spiral relief. The Column of Marcus Aurelius is located in Piazza Colonna and it was built around 180 AD by Commodus in memory of his parents. The Column of Marcus Aurelius was inspired by Trajan's Column at Trajan's Forum, which is part of the Imperial Fora.[182]\n\n\n\n#### Bridges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of bridges in Rome\n\n![](image)Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II at sunset\nThe city of Rome contains numerous famous bridges which cross the Tiber. The only bridge to remain unaltered until today from the classical age is Ponte dei Quattro Capi, which connects the Isola Tiberina with the left bank. The other surviving – albeit modified – ancient Roman bridges crossing the Tiber are Ponte Cestio, Ponte Sant'Angelo and Ponte Milvio. Considering Ponte Nomentano, also built during ancient Rome, which crosses the Aniene, currently there are five ancient Roman bridges still remaining in the city.[183] Other noteworthy bridges are Ponte Sisto, the first bridge built in the Renaissance above Roman foundations; Ponte Rotto, actually the only remaining arch of the ancient *Pons Aemilius*, collapsed during the flood of 1598 and demolished at the end of the 19th century; and Ponte Vittorio Emanuele II, a modern bridge connecting Corso Vittorio Emanuele and Borgo. Most of the city's public bridges were built in Classical or Renaissance style, but also in Baroque, Neoclassical and Modern styles. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, the finest ancient bridge remaining in Rome is the Ponte Sant'Angelo, which was completed in 135 AD, and was decorated with ten statues of the angels, designed by Bernini in 1688.[184]\n\n\n\n#### Catacombs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catacombs of Rome\n\n![](image)The Vatican Caves, the place where many popes are buried\nRome has an extensive amount of ancient catacombs, or underground burial places under or near the city, of which there are at least forty, some discovered only in recent decades. Though most famous for Christian burials, they include pagan and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through tuff, a soft volcanic rock, outside the boundaries of the city, because Roman law forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the Papacy which has invested in the Salesians of Don Bosco the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music in Rome and Events in Rome\n\n![](image)The Teatro dell'Opera di Roma at the Piazza Beniamino Gigli\nRome is an important centre for music, and it has an intense musical scene, including several prestigious music conservatories and theatres. It hosts the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (founded in 1585), for which new concert halls have been built in the new Parco della Musica, one of the largest musical venues in the world. Rome also has an opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, as well as several minor musical institutions. The city also played host to the Eurovision Song Contest in 1991 and the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2004.\n\n\nRome has also had a major impact on music history. The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music, which were active in the city during the 16th and 17th centuries, therefore spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. The term also refers to the music they produced. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose name has been associated for four hundred years with smooth, clear, polyphonic perfection. However, there were other composers working in Rome, and in a variety of styles and forms.\n\n\nBetween 1960 and 1970 Rome was considered to be as a \"new Hollywood\" because of the many actors and directors who worked there; Via Vittorio Veneto had transformed into a glamour place where you could meet famous people.[185]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Via Condotti\nRome is also widely recognised as a world fashion capital. Although not as important as Milan, Rome is the fourth most important centre for fashion in the world, according to the 2009 Global Language Monitor after Milan, New York, and Paris, and beating London.[186]\n\n\nMajor luxury fashion houses and jewellery chains, such as Valentino, Bulgari, Fendi,[187] Laura Biagiotti, Brioni, and Renato Balestra, are headquartered or were founded in the city. Also, other major labels, such as Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, and Versace have luxury boutiques in Rome, primarily along its prestigious and upscale Via dei Condotti.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman cuisine\n\n![](image)*Spaghetti alla carbonara*, a typical Roman dish\nRome's cuisine has evolved through centuries and periods of social, cultural, and political changes. Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the ancient age. Ancient Roman cuisine was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques.[188]\n\n\nLater, during the Renaissance, Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was Bartolomeo Scappi, who was a chef working for Pius IV; he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook *Opera dell'arte del cucinare* was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance cuisine and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a fork.[189]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Concia di zucchine*, an example of Roman-Jewish cuisine\nThe Testaccio, Rome's trade and slaughterhouse area, was often known as the \"belly\" or \"slaughterhouse\" of Rome, and was inhabited by butchers, or *vaccinari*.[190] The most common or ancient Roman cuisine included the \"fifth quarter\".[190] The old-fashioned *coda alla vaccinara* (oxtail cooked in the way of butchers)[190] is still one of the city's most popular meals and is part of most of Rome's restaurants' menus. Lamb is also a very popular part of Roman cuisine, and is often roasted with spices and herbs.[190]\n\n\nIn the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby Campagna, as lamb and vegetables (globe artichokes are common).[191] In parallel, Roman Jews – present in the city since the 1st century BC – developed their own cuisine, the *cucina giudaico-romanesca*.\n\n\nExamples of Roman dishes include *saltimbocca alla romana* – a veal cutlet, Roman-style, topped with raw ham and sage and simmered with white wine and butter; *carciofi alla romana* – artichokes Roman-style, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *carciofi alla giudia* – artichokes fried in olive oil, typical of Roman Jewish cooking, outer leaves removed, stuffed with mint, garlic, breadcrumbs and braised; *spaghetti alla carbonara* – spaghetti with bacon, eggs and pecorino; and *gnocchi di semolino alla romana* – semolina dumpling, Roman-style.[192]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of films set in Rome and List of films set in ancient Rome\n\n![](image)Entrance to the Cinecittà studios, the largest film studio in Europe[193]\nRome hosts the Cinecittà Studios,[194] the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where many of today's biggest box office hits are filmed. The 99-acre (40 ha) studio complex is 9.0 km (5.6 mi) from the centre of Rome and is part of one of the biggest production communities in the world, second only to Hollywood, with well over 5,000 professionals – from period costume makers to visual effects specialists. More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFounded in 1937 by Benito Mussolini, the studios were bombed by the Western Allies during the Second World War. In the 1950s, Cinecittà was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with Federico Fellini. Today, Cinecittà is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walkout\" with a completed film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stadio Olimpico, home of A.S. Roma and S.S. Lazio, is one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity of over 70,000.[195]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Rome, as in the rest of the country.\nThe city hosted the final games of the 1934 and 1990 FIFA World Cup.\nThe latter took place in the Stadio Olimpico, which is also the shared home stadium for local Serie A clubs S.S. Lazio, founded in 1900, and A.S. Roma, founded in 1927, whose rivalry in the Derby della Capitale has become a staple of Roman sports culture.[196]\nFootballers who play for these teams and are also born in the city tend to become especially popular, as has been the case with players such as Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi (both for A.S. Roma), and Alessandro Nesta (for S.S. Lazio).\n\n\n\n![](image)Stadio dei Marmi\nRome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics, with great success, using many ancient sites such as the Villa Borghese and the Thermae of Caracalla as venues. For the Olympic Games many new facilities were built, notably the new large Olympic Stadium (which was then enlarged and renewed to host several matches and the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup), the Stadio Flaminio, the Villaggio Olimpico (Olympic Village, created to host the athletes and redeveloped after the games as a residential district), ecc. Rome made a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics but it was withdrawn.[197][198]\n\n\nFurther, Rome hosted the 1991 EuroBasket and is home to the internationally recognised basketball team Virtus Roma. Rugby union is gaining wider acceptance. Until 2011 the Stadio Flaminio was the home stadium for the Italy national rugby union team, which has been playing in the Six Nations Championship since 2000. The team now plays home games at the Stadio Olimpico because the Stadio Flaminio needs works of renovation in order to improve both its capacity and safety. Rome is home to local rugby union teams such as Rugby Roma (winner of five Italian championships), Unione Rugby Capitolina and S.S. Lazio 1927 (rugby union branch of the multisport club S.S. Lazio).\n\n\nEvery May, Rome hosts the ATP Masters Series tennis tournament on the clay courts of the Foro Italico. Cycling was popular in the post-World War II period, although its popularity has faded. Rome has hosted the final portion of the Giro d'Italia three times, in 1911, 1950, and 2009. Other local sports teams include volleyball (M. Roma Volley), handball or waterpolo.\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Rome\n\n![](image)Rome–Fiumicino Airport was the tenth busiest airport in Europe in 2016.\n![](image)Port of Civitavecchia\nRome is at the centre of the radial network of roads that roughly follow the lines of the ancient Roman roads which began at the Capitoline Hill and connected Rome with its empire. Today Rome is circled, at a distance of about 10 km (6 mi) from the Capitol, by the ring-road (the *Grande Raccordo Anulare* or *GRA*).\n\n\nDue to its location in the centre of the Italian peninsula, Rome is the principal railway node for central Italy. Rome's main railway station, Termini, is one of the largest railway stations in Europe and the most heavily used in Italy, with around 400 thousand travellers passing through every day. The second-largest station in the city, Roma Tiburtina, has been redeveloped as a high-speed rail terminus.[199] As well as frequent high-speed day trains to all major Italian cities, Rome is linked nightly by 'boat train' sleeper services to Sicily, and internationally by overnight sleeper services to Munich and Vienna.\n\n\nRome is served by three airports. The intercontinental Leonardo da Vinci International Airport, Italy's chief airport is located in the nearby Fiumicino, south-west of Rome. The older Rome Ciampino Airport is a joint civilian and military airport. It is commonly referred to as \"Ciampino Airport\", as it is located beside Ciampino, south-east of Rome. A third airport, the Roma-Urbe Airport, is a small, low-traffic airport located about 6 km (4 mi) north of the city centre, which handles most helicopter and private flights. The main airport system of the city (composed of Fiumicino and Ciampino), with 32.8 million passengers transported in 2022, is the second busiest airport system in Italy.[200]\n\n\nAlthough the city has its own quarter on the Mediterranean Sea (Lido di Ostia), this has only a marina and a small channel-harbour for fishing boats. The main harbour which serves Rome is Port of Civitavecchia, located about 62 km (39 mi) northwest of the city.[201]\n\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.[202] Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during daylight hours. Areas, where these restrictions apply, are known as Limited Traffic Zones (*Zona a Traffico Limitato* (ZTL)). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in Trastevere, Testaccio and San Lorenzo has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016\n![](image)Conca d'Oro metro station\nA three-line metro system called the *Metropolitana* operates in Rome. Construction on the first branch started in the 1930s.[203] The line had been planned to quickly connect the main railway station with the newly planned E42 area in the southern suburbs, where 1942 the World Fair was supposed to be held. The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed Esposizione Universale Roma in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999–2000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. The A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of €500 million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of 3.9 km (2 mi).\n\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of €3 billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of 25.5 km (16 mi). It will partly replace the existing Termini-Pantano rail line. It will feature full automated, driverless trains.[204] The first section with 15 stations connecting Pantano with the quarter of Centocelle in the eastern part of the city, opened on 9 November 2014.[205] The end of the work was scheduled in 2015, but archaeological findings often delay underground construction work.\n\n\nA fourth line, D line, is also planned. It will have 22 stations over a distance of 20 km (12 mi). The first section was projected to open in 2015 and the final sections before 2035, but due to the city's financial crisis, the project has been put on hold.\n\n\nAbove-ground public transport in Rome is made up of a bus, tram and urban train network (FR lines). The bus network has in excess of 350 bus lines and over eight thousand bus stops, whereas the more-limited tram system has 39 km (24 mi) of track and 192 stops.[206] There are also trolleybuses.[207]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![flag](image)EU portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Outline of Rome\n* SPQR\n* Tourism in Italy\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also the Vatican City\n2. **^** This hypothesis originates from the Roman Grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus.

It is the ninth-largest city in the European Union by population within city limits and the largest city on the Danube river;[14][15][16] the city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of about 525 square kilometres (203 square miles).[17] Budapest, which is both a city and county, forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan area, which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square miles) and a population of 3,303,786. It is a primate city, constituting 33% of the population of Hungary.[18][19]\n\n\nThe history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum,[20][21] the capital of Lower Pannonia.[20] The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century,[22] but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241–42.[23] Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century.[24][25][26] The Battle of Mohács, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule.[27] After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda, Óbuda and Pest on 17 November 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital.[17][28] Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,[29] a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Battle of Budapest in 1945, as well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.[30][31]\n\n\nBudapest is a global city with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment.[32][33] Hungary's financial centre, Budapest is also the headquarters of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology,[34] the European Police College[35] and the first foreign office of the China Investment Promotion Agency.[36] Over 40 colleges and universities are located in Budapest, including Eötvös Loránd University, Corvinus University, Semmelweis University, University of Veterinary Medicine Budapest and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.[37][38] Opened in 1896,[39] the city's subway system, the Budapest Metro, serves 1.27 million, while the Budapest Tram Network serves 1.08 million passengers daily.[40]\n\n\nThe central area of Budapest along the Danube River is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has several notable monuments of classical architecture, including the Hungarian Parliament and the Buda Castle.[41] The city also has around 80 geothermal springs,[42] the largest thermal water cave system,[43] second largest synagogue, and third largest Parliament building in the world.[44] Budapest attracts around 12 million international tourists per year, making it a highly popular destination in Europe.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and pronunciation[edit]\n\n\nThe previously separate towns of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest were officially unified in 1873[46] and given the new name *Budapest*. Before this, the towns together had sometimes been referred to colloquially as \"Pest-Buda\".[47][48] *Pest* is used *pars pro toto* for the entire city in contemporary colloquial Hungarian.[47]\n\n\nAll varieties of English pronounce the *-s-* as in the English word *pest*. The *-u* in *Buda-* is pronounced either /u/ like *food* (as in US: /ˈbuːdəpɛst/[49]) or /ju/ like *cue* (as in UK: /ˌb(j)uːdəˈpɛst, ˌbʊd-, ˈb(j)uːdəpɛst, ˈbʊd-/). In Hungarian, the *-s-* is pronounced /ʃ/ as in *wash*; in IPA: Hungarian: [ˈbudɒpɛʃt] ⓘ.\n\n\nThe origins of the names \"Buda\" and \"Pest\" are obscure. Buda was\n\n\n\n* probably the name of the first constable of the fortress built on the Castle Hill in the 11th century[50]\n* or a derivative of *Bod* or *Bud*, a personal name of Turkic origin, meaning 'twig'.[51]\n* or a Slavic personal name, *Buda*, the short form of *Budimír*, *Budivoj*.[52]\n\n\nLinguistically, however, a German origin through the Slavic derivative вода (*voda*, water) is not possible, and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word *buta* ~ *buda* 'branch, twig'.[53]\n\n\nAccording to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages, \"Buda\" comes from the name of its founder, Bleda, brother of Hunnic ruler Attila.\n\n\n\n\n> Attila went in the city of Sicambria in Pannonia, where he killed Buda, his brother, and he threw his corpse into the Danube. For while Attila was in the west, his brother crossed the boundaries in his reign, because he named Sicambria after his own name Buda's Castle. And though King Attila forbade the Huns and the other peoples to call that city Buda's Castle, but he called it Attila's Capital, the Germans who were terrified by the prohibition named the city as Eccylburg, which means Attila Castle, however, the Hungarians did not care about the ban and call it Óbuda [Old Buda] and call it to this day.\n> \n> — Mark of Kalt: *Chronicon Pictum*[54]\n> \n\n\n\n> The Scythians are certainly an ancient people and the strength of Scythia lies in the east, as we said above. And the first king of Scythia was Magog, son of Japhet, and his people were called Magyars [Hungarians] after their King Magog, from whose royal line the most renowned and mighty King Attila descended, who, in the 451st year of Our Lord's birth, coming down from Scythia, entered Pannonia with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the Danube above the hot springs, and he ordered all the old buildings that he found there to be restored and he built them in a circular and very strong wall that in the Hungarian language is now called Budavár [Buda Castle] and by the Germans Etzelburg [Attila Castle]\n> \n> — Anonymus: *Gesta Hungarorum*[55]\n> \n\n\nThere are several theories about Pest. One[56] states that the name derives from Roman times, since there was a local fortress (Contra-Aquincum) called by Ptolemy \"Pession\" (\"Πέσσιον\", iii.7.§ 2).[57] Another has it that Pest originates in the Slavic word for cave, *пещера*, or *peštera*. A third cites *пещ*, or *pešt*, referencing a cave where fires burned or a limekiln.[58]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Budapest\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Budapest.\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buda during the Middle Ages, woodcut from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)\nThe first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by Celts[20] before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD.[20] At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest.[59] The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp.[60] The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary. The archaeological site was turned into a museum with indoor and open-air sections.[61]\n\n\nThe Magyar tribes led by Árpád, forced out of their original homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh, settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest,[22][62] and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary.[22] Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an early place of central power near what became Budapest.[63] The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain.[17][22] King Béla IV of Hungary, therefore, ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns[22] and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary.[23][17]\n\n\nThe cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second in size only to the Vatican Library.[17] After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in Pécs in 1367 (University of Pécs), the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 (University of Óbuda).[64] The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473.[65] Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around the year 1500.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Retaking of Buda from the Ottoman Empire*, painted by Frans Geffels in 1686\nThe Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.[67] The Turkish Rule lasted for more than 150 years.[17] The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city.[22] Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later (Rudas Baths and Király Baths). By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it had fallen to only about seventy.[66] The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg monarchy as Royal Hungary.\n\n\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign was started to enter Buda. This time, the Holy League's army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesvár (Timișoara), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, these territorial changes were officially recognized as the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history after Unification[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hungary during World War II\n\n![](image)Millennium Underground (1894–1896), the second oldest metro in the world (after the Metropolitan line of the London Underground)\n![](image)The Hungarian revolutionary army liberates the Buda castle in May 1849.\nThe 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence[17] and modernisation. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube[68] and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.[69][70][71] Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the \"Jewish Mecca\"[23] or \"Judapest\".[72][73] Budapest also became an important center for the Aromanian diaspora during the 19th century.[74] In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (Republic of Hungary). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.[75][76]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hungarian State Opera House, built in the time of Austria-Hungary\n![](image)Bond of the City of Budapest, issued 1 May 1911\n![](image)The Chain Bridge was destroyed during the Siege of Budapest.\n![](image)Soviet tanks in Budapest (1956)\nIn 1944, a year before the end of World War II, Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (first attack 4 April 1944[77][78][79]).\nFrom 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest. Budapest sustained major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians died during the conflict. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.[80]\n\n\nBetween 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party, during the German occupation of Hungary, from 1944 to early 1945.[81]\n\n\nSwiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.[82] Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat.[83][84] Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.\n\n\nFollowing the capture of Hungary from Nazi Germany by the Red Army, Soviet military occupation ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic (People's Republic of Hungary). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see Stalin era).\nOn 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of Hungary. To their surprise, the central committee of the \"Hungarian Working People's Party\" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the Warsaw Pact and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.[85]\n\n\nFrom the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as \"the happiest barrack\" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzsébet Bridge, the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro's east–west M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Andrássy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway, Hősök tere, and Városliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county, i.e., suburbanisation.[86]\n\n\nIn the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 (Fall of the Iron Curtain) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into Memento Park. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, Gábor Demszky.[87]\n\n\nIn October 2019, opposition candidate Gergely Karácsony won the Budapest mayoral election, meaning the first electoral blow for Hungary's nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán since coming to power in 2010.[88]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite imagery of Budapest\nBudapest, strategically placed at the centre of the Carpathian Basin, lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain. By road it is 216 kilometres (134 mi) south-east of Vienna, 545 kilometres (339 mi) south of Warsaw, 1,565 kilometres (972 mi) south-west of Moscow, 1,122 kilometres (697 mi) north of Athens, 788 kilometres (490 mi) north-east of Milan, and 443 kilometres (275 mi) south-east of Prague.[89]\n\n\nThe 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi) area of Budapest lies in Central Hungary, surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 km (16 and 18 mi) in the north–south, east–west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, Óbuda Island and Margaret Island.[17] The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is 230 m (755 ft) wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.[17]\n\n\nThe wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank.[90] Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill.[91]\n\n\nThe Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created speleothems, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length 7,200 m or 23,600 ft) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length 2,200 m or 7,200 ft). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János Hill, at 527 metres (1,729 feet) above sea level. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 metres (315 feet) above sea level. Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the 525 square kilometres (203 square miles) occupied by the city, 83 square kilometres (32 square miles) is green area, park and forest.[92] The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.[93]\n\n\nThe city's importance in terms of traffic is very central, because many major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest.[91] The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes.[94]\nBudapest is one of only three capital cities in the world which has thermal springs (the others being Reykjavík in Iceland and Sofia in Bulgaria). Some 125 springs produce 70 million litres (15,000,000 imperial gallons; 18,000,000 US gallons) of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have been claimed to have medicinal effects due to their high mineral contents.[91]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Budapest\n\nBudapest has a humid subtropical climate.[95] Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of −10 °C (14 °F) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest's long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.\n\n\nMean annual precipitation in Budapest is around 23.5 inches (596.9 mm). On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year.[3][96][97] From March to October, average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy (Venice).\n\n\nThe city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the hardiness zone.[98][99]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Budapest, 1991–2020\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 4.1(39.4)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 4.6(40.3)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 7.2(45.0)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 0.1(32.2)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 4.3(39.7)\n | −0.2(31.6)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −25.6(−14.1)\n | −23.4(−10.1)\n | −15.1(4.8)\n | −4.6(23.7)\n | −1.6(29.1)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −9.5(14.9)\n | −16.4(2.5)\n | −20.8(−5.4)\n | −25.6(−14.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 29(1.1)\n | 30(1.2)\n | 42(1.7)\n | 62(2.4)\n | 63(2.5)\n | 45(1.8)\n | 49(1.9)\n | 40(1.6)\n | 39(1.5)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 43(1.7)\n | 532(20.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 7.3\n | 6.1\n | 6.4\n | 6.6\n | 8.6\n | 8.7\n | 7.2\n | 6.9\n | 5.9\n | 5.3\n | 7.8\n | 7.2\n | 84\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 74\n | 66\n | 59\n | 61\n | 61\n | 59\n | 61\n | 67\n | 72\n | 78\n | 80\n | 68.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 62\n | 93\n | 137\n | 177\n | 234\n | 250\n | 271\n | 255\n | 187\n | 141\n | 69\n | 52\n | 1,988\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 8\n | 8\n | 7\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source: Average temperatures 1991-2020: OMSZ - Hungarian Meteorological Service.[100] |\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Buildings and structures in Budapest and List of churches in Budapest\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise, from upper left**: the ruins of the Celtic and Roman civil town of Aquincum; Romanesque 12th century Gercse Parish Church; the Buda Castle; Kós Károly Square in the Wekerletelep; Ottoman Tomb of Gül Baba; and Gothic Mary Magdalene Church\n\nBudapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern Palace of Arts, the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.[103][104][105]\n\n\nMost buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.[106][107]\n\n\nIn the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing ancient architecture.\n\n\nThe next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the Inner City Parish Church, built in the 12th century,[108] and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century.[109] The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building[110] and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).[111]\n\n\nThe next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[112]\n\n\nDuring the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with \"the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India\".[113] Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, Gül Baba is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as Szechenyi. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (Budapest). The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—\"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon\".[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The most famous Budapest bridge, the Chain Bridge, the icon of the city's 19th century development, built in 1849\nAfter 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.[114] There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.[114]\n\n\nThe Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. Mihály Pollack (1773–1855) and József Hild (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum, the Lutheran Church of Budavár (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president, the Sándor Palace. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.[115] Budapest's two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Dohány Street and the Vigadó Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade, both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station, which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hungarian Parliament, completed in 1904\nArt Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations.[117] Art Nouveau in Hungary (*Szecesszió* in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, Ödön Lechner (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gellért, the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden.[103]\n\n\n\n> \n> It is one of the world's outstanding urban landscapes and illustrates the great periods in the history of the Hungarian capital.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*UNESCO*[118]\n\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats (panelház), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city. Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square, Deák Ferenc square and Liberty Square. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the National Theatre, Palace of Arts, Rákóczi Bridge, Megyeri Bridge, Budapest Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments. But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n**From left**: Saint Anne Parish; Matthias Church; Fisherman's Bastion; and Stigmatisation of Saint Francis Church\n\n## Districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts in Budapest\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Budapest's twenty-three districts overview**\n |\n| **Administration** | **Population** | **Area and Density** |\n| *District* | *Official name* | *Official 2013* | *Km2* | *People/km2* |\n| **I** | Várkerület | 24.528 | 3,41 | 7.233\n |\n| **II** | Rózsadomb | 88.011 | 36,34 | 2.426\n |\n| **III** | Óbuda-Békásmegyer | 123.889 | 39,69 | 3.117\n |\n| **IV** | Újpest | 99.050 | 18,82 | 5.227\n |\n| **V** | Belváros-Lipótváros | 27.342 | 2,59 | 10.534\n |\n| **VI** | Terézváros | 43.377 | 2,38 | 18.226\n |\n| **VII** | Erzsébetváros | 64.767 | 2,09 | **30.989** |\n| **VIII** | Józsefváros | 85.173 | 6,85 | 11.890\n |\n| **IX** | Ferencváros | 63.697 | 12,53 | 4.859\n |\n| **X** | Kőbánya | 81.475 | 32,5 | 2.414\n |\n| **XI** | Újbuda | **145.510** | 33,47 | 4.313\n |\n| **XII** | Hegyvidék | 55.776 | 26,67 | 2.109\n |\n| **XIII** | Angyalföld,Göncz Árpád városközpont,Újlipótváros, Vizafogó | 118.320 | 13,44 | 8.804\n |\n| **XIV** | Zugló | 123.786 | 18,15 | 6.820\n |\n| **XV** | Rákospalota, Pestújhely, Újpalota | 79.779 | 26,95 | 2.988\n |\n| **XVI** | Árpádföld, Cinkota, Mátyásföld,Sashalom, Rákosszentmihály | 68.235 | 33,52 | 2.037\n |\n| **XVII** | Rákosmente | 78.537 | **54.83** | 1.418\n |\n| **XVIII** | Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre | 94.663 | 38,61 | 2.414\n |\n| **XIX** | Kispest | 62.210 | 9,38 | 6.551\n |\n| **XX** | Pesterzsébet | 63.887 | 12,18 | 5.198\n |\n| **XXI** | Csepel | 76.976 | 25,75 | 2.963\n |\n| **XXII** | Budafok-Tétény | 51.071 | 34,25 | 1.473\n |\n| **XXIII** | Soroksár | 19.982 | 40,78 | 501\n |\n| ![](image) **City of Budapest**\n | **1,740,041** | **525.2** | **3,313.1** |\n| Hungary\n | 9,937,628 | 93,030 | 107.2\n |\n| *Source: Eurostat,[122] HSCO[7]* |\n\n\nMost of today's Budapest is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide boulevards laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest's evolution as a city. Budapest's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflecting the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs.[123] Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.[124] Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, Greater Budapest has been divided into 22 boroughs (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them. The city centre itself, in its broadest sense, comprises Districts **V, VI, VII, VIII, IX**[125] and **XIII** on the Pest side, and **I, II, XI** and **XII** on the Buda side of the city.[126]\n\n\nDistrict I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is also in Buda, in the northwest, and District III stretches along the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to Pest (the eastern side), where it occupies the northernmost point. With District V, another circle begins, located right in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other. District X is another, more external circle, also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No other districts in this circle remain in Buda. We must retrace our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external parts of the city ), lying almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again. District XXI is the extension of the above circle between two branches of the Danube, the northern tip of a long island south of Budapest. District XXII is still on the same circle in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular only because it was part of District XX until 1994.[127]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Budapest\n\n![](image)Budapest population pyramid in 2022\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Budapest compared to Hungary and EU**\n |\n|  | **Budapest** | **Hungary** | **European Union** |\n| **Total Population** | 1,763,913 | 9,937,628 | 507,890,191\n |\n| **Population change, 2004 to 2014** | +2.7%[128] | −1.6%[128] | +2.2%[129] |\n| **Population density** | 3,314 /km2 | 107 /km2 | 116 /km2 |\n| **GDP per capita PPP** | $52,770[130] | $33,408[131] | $33,084[132] |\n| **Bachelor's Degree or higher** | 34.1%[133] | 19.0%[133] | 27.1%[134] |\n| **Foreign born** | 7.3%[135] | 1.7%[136] | 6.3%[137] |\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1784  | 57,100 | —     |\n| 1850  | 206,339 | +261.4% |\n| 1870  | 302,086 | +46.4% |\n| 1880  | 402,706 | +33.3% |\n| 1890  | 560,079 | +39.1% |\n| 1900  | 861,434 | +53.8% |\n| 1910  | 1,110,453 | +28.9% |\n| 1920  | 1,232,026 | +10.9% |\n| 1930  | 1,442,869 | +17.1% |\n| 1941  | 1,712,791 | +18.7% |\n| 1949  | 1,590,316 | −7.2% |\n| 1955  | 1,713,552 | +7.7% |\n| 1960  | 1,804,606 | +5.3% |\n| 1965  | 1,877,916 | +4.1% |\n| 1970  | 1,945,083 | +3.6% |\n| 1980  | 2,059,226 | +5.9% |\n| 1990  | 2,005,028 | −2.6% |\n| 2001  | 1,773,401 | −11.6% |\n| 2011  | 1,729,040 | −2.5% |\n| 2022  | 1,682,426 | −2.7% |\n| 1784,[138] Population 2001 to 2019[128]Present-territory of BudapestPopulation size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. |\n\n\nBudapest is the most populous city in Hungary and one of the largest cities in the European Union, with a growing number of inhabitants, estimated at 1,763,913 in 2019,[139] whereby inward migration exceeds outward migration.[14] These trends are also seen throughout the Budapest metropolitan area, which is home to 3.3 million people.[140][141] This amounts to about 34% of Hungary's population. In 2014, the city had a population density of 3,314 people per square kilometre (8,580/sq mi), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities in Hungary. The population density of Elisabethtown-District VII is 30,989/km2 (80,260/sq mi), which has the highest population density figure in Hungary and one of the highest in the world. For comparison, the density in Manhattan is 25,846/km2.[142]\n\n\nBudapest is the fourth most \"dynamically growing city\" by population in Europe,[143] and the Euromonitor predicts a population increase of almost 10% between 2005 and 2030.[144] The European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion says Budapest's population will increase by 10% to 30% only due to migration by 2050.[145] A constant inflow of migrants in recent years has fuelled population growth in Budapest. Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why household incomes have increased in Budapest to a greater extent than in other parts of Hungary. Higher incomes in Budapest are reflected in the lower share of expenditure the city's inhabitants allocate to necessary spending such as on food and non-alcoholic drinks.[140]\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 microcensus, there were 1,764,263 people living in Budapest in 907,944 dwellings.[146] Some 1.6 million persons from the metropolitan area may be within Budapest's boundaries during working hours, and during special events. This fluctuation in the population is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.[147]\n\n\nBy ethnicity there were 1,697,039 (96.2%) Hungarians, 34,909 (2%) Germans, 16,592 (0.9%) Romani, 9,117 (0.5%) Romanians and 5,488 (0.3%) Slovaks.[148] In Hungary people can declare multiple ethnic identities, hence the sum may exceed 100%.[149] The share of ethnic Hungarians in Budapest (96.2%) is slightly lower than the national average (98.3%) due to the international migration.[149]\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 1,712,153 people (99.0%) speak Hungarian, of whom 1,692,815 people (97.9%) speak it as a first language, while 19,338 people (1.1%) speak it as a second language. Other spoken (foreign) languages were: English (536,855 speakers, 31.0%), German (266,249 speakers, 15.4%), French (56,208 speakers, 3.3%) and Russian (54,613 speakers, 3.2%).[135]\n\n\nAccording to the same census, 1,600,585 people (92.6%) were born in Hungary, 126,036 people (7.3%) outside Hungary while the birthplace of 2,419 people (0.1%) was unknown.[135]\nAlthough only 1.7% of the population of Hungary in 2009 were foreigners, 43% of them lived in Budapest, making them 4.4% of the city's population (up from 2% in 2001).[136] Nearly two-thirds of foreigners living in Hungary were under 40 years old. The primary motivation for this age group living in Hungary was employment.[136]\n\n\nBudapest is home to one of the most populous Christian communities in Central Europe, numbering 698,521 people (40.4%) in 2011.[135] According to the 2011 census, there were 501,117 (29.0%) Roman Catholics, 146,756 (8.5%) Calvinists, 30,293 (1.8%) Lutherans, 16,192 (0.9%) Greek Catholics, 7,925 (0.5%) Jews and 3,710 (0.2%) Orthodox in Budapest. 395,964 people (22.9%) were irreligious while 585,475 people (33.9%) did not declare their religion.[135] The city is also home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe.[150]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of companies based in Budapest and Economy of Hungary\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The city had a gross metropolitan product of more than $100 billion in 2015, making it one of the largest regional economies in the European Union.[152]\nAccording to Eurostat GDP, per capita in purchasing power parity is 147% of the EU average in Budapest, which means €37,632 ($42,770) per capita.[130]\nBudapest is also among the Top 100 GDP performing cities in the world, measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The city was named as the 52nd most important business centre in the world in the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index, ahead of Beijing, São Paulo and Shenzhen and ranking 3rd (out of 65 cities) on the MasterCard Emerging Markets Index.[153][154] The city is 48th on the UBS *The most expensive and richest cities in the world* list, standing before cities such as Prague, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Buenos Aires.[155]\nIn a global city competitiveness ranking by the EIU, Budapest stands before Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Moscow and Johannesburg among others.[156]\n\n\nThe city is a major centre for banking and finance, real estate, retailing, trade, transportation, tourism, new media as well as traditional media, advertising, legal services, accountancy, insurance, fashion and the arts in Hungary and regionally. Budapest is home not only to almost all national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies. In 2014 there were 395.804 companies registered in the city.[157] Most of these entities are headquartered in Budapest's Central Business District, in the District V and District XIII. The retail market of the city (and the country) is also concentrated in the downtown area, among others, in the two largest shopping centres in Central and Eastern Europe, the 186,000 sqm WestEnd City Center and the 180,000 sqm Arena Plaza.[158][159]\n\n\nBudapest has notable innovation capabilities as a technology and start-up hub. Many start-ups are headquartered and begin their business in the city. Some of the best known examples are Prezi, LogMeIn and NNG. Budapest is the highest ranked Central and Eastern European city in the Innovation Cities' Top 100 index.[160] A good indicator of the city's potential for innovation and research, is that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology chose Budapest for its headquarters, along with the UN, whose Regional Representation for Central Europe office is in the city, responsible for UN operations in seven countries.[161] Moreover, the global aspect of the city's research activity is shown through the establishment of the European Chinese Research Institute in the city.[162] Other important sectors also include, natural science research, information technology and medical research, non-profit institutions, and universities. The leading business schools and universities in Budapest, the Budapest Business School, the CEU Business School and Corvinus University of Budapest offer a whole range of courses in economics, finance and management in English, French, German and Hungarian.[163] The unemployment rate in Budapest is by far the lowest within Hungary. It was 2.7%, with many thousands of employed foreign citizens.[164]\n\n\nBudapest is among the 25 most visited cities in the world, welcoming more than 4.4 million international visitors each year,[165] therefore the traditional and the congress tourism industry also deserve a mention, as they contribute greatly to the city's economy. The capital is home to many convention centres and there are thousands of restaurants, bars, coffee houses and party places, besides a full range of hotels. As regards restaurants, examples can be found of the highest quality Michelin-starred restaurants, such as Onyx, Costes, Tanti and Borkonyha. The city ranked as the most liveable city in Central and Eastern Europe on EIU's quality of life index in 2010.\n\n\n\n### Finance and corporate location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nHungarian Stock Exchange Palace on Liberty Square\n\nThe Budapest Stock Exchange, a key institution of publicly offered securities in Hungary and Central and Eastern Europe, is situated in Budapest's CBD at Liberty Square. BSE also trades other securities such as government bonds and derivatives as well as stock options. Large Hungarian multinational corporations headquartered in Budapest are listed on the BSE, for instance the Fortune Global 500 firms MOL Group, the OTP Bank, FHB Bank, Gedeon Richter, Magyar Telekom, CIG Pannonia, Zwack Unicum and more.[166] Nowadays nearly all branches of industry can be found in Budapest. Although there is no particularly special industry in the city's economy, the financial centre role of the city is strong, with nearly 40 major banks being represented in the city including[167] as well as those like Bank of China, KDB Bank and Hanwha Bank, which are unique in the region.\n\n\n\n![](image)MOL Campus, a neomodern skyscraper and the headquarters of MOL Group\nMany international banks and financial service providers also support the financial industry of Budapest, firms such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, GE Capital, Deutsche Bank, Sberbank, ING Group, Allianz, KBC Group, UniCredit and MSCI among others. Another particularly strong industry in the capital city is the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. There are also traditionally strong domestic companies in Budapest such as Egis, Gedeon Richter, Chinoin as well as international biotechnology corporations such as Pfizer, Teva, Novartis, Sanofi, which also have R&D and production divisions here. Further high-tech industries, involved in software development and engineering are notable as well. Nokia, Ericsson, Bosch, Microsoft and IBM employ thousands of engineers in research and development in the city. Game design is also strongly represented with headquarters of domestic companies Digital Reality, Black Hole and the studios of Crytek and Gameloft. Apart from the above, there are regional headquarters of global firms such as Alcoa, General Motors, General Electric, ExxonMobil, BP, BT, Flextronics, Panasonic, Huawei, Knorr-Bremse, Liberty Global, Tata Consultancy, Aegon, WizzAir, TriGránit, MVM Group and Graphisoft. There is a base for major international companies including, but not limited to, Nissan CEE, Volvo, Saab and Ford.\n\n\n\n## Politics and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Hungary\n\n![](image)Model United Nations conference in the assembly hall of House of Magnates\n![](image)Old building (from 1890) of the Hungarian Royal Curia, that operated as the highest court in the Kingdom of Hungary between 1723 and 1949. Now it houses a museum.\n![](image)U.S. President George W. Bush meets with Hungarian President László Sólyom at Sándor Palace in Budapest.\n![](image)Sándor Palace, the official residence and workspace of the president of Hungary\nAs the capital of Hungary, Budapest is the seat of the country's national government. The President of Hungary resides at the Sándor Palace in the District I (Buda Castle District),[168] while the office of the Hungarian Prime Minister is in the Carmelite Monastery in the Castle District.[169] Government ministries are all located in various parts of the city, most of them are in the District V, Leopoldtown. The National Assembly is seated in the Hungarian Parliament, which also located in the District V.[170] The President of the National Assembly, the third-highest public official in Hungary, is also seated in the largest building in the country, in the Hungarian Parliament.\n\n\nHungary's highest courts are located in Budapest. The Curia (supreme court of Hungary), the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the District V, Leopoldtown. Under the authority of its president it has three departments: criminal, civil and administrative-labour law departments. Each department has various chambers. The Curia guarantees the uniform application of law. The decisions of the Curia on uniform jurisdiction are binding for other courts.[171] The second most important judicial authority, the National Judicial Council, is also housed in the District V, with the tasks of controlling the financial management of the judicial administration and the courts and giving an opinion on the practice of the president of the National Office for the Judiciary and the Curia deciding about the applications of judges and court leaders, among others.[172]\nThe Constitutional Court of Hungary is one of the highest level actors independent of the politics in the country. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for the protection of the Constitution, its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system. The constitutional court passes on the constitutionality of laws, and there is no right of appeal on these decisions.[173]\n\n\nBudapest hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organizations as well, including United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, European Institute of Innovation and Technology, European Police Academy, International Centre for Democratic Transition, Institute of International Education, International Labour Organization, International Organization for Migration, International Red Cross, Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, Danube Commission and even others.[174] The city is also home to more than 100 embassies and representative bodies as an international political actor.\n\n\nEnvironmental issues have a high priority among Budapest's politics. Institutions such as the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, located in Budapest, are very important assets.[175] To decrease the use of cars and greenhouse gas emissions, the city has worked to improve public transportation, and nowadays the city has one of the highest mass transit usage in Europe. Budapest has one of the best public transport systems in Europe with an efficient network of buses, trolleys, trams and subway. Budapest has an above-average proportion of people commuting on public transport or walking and cycling for European cities.[176] Riding on bike paths is one of the best ways to see Budapest – there are about 180 kilometres (110 miles) of bicycle paths in the city, fitting into the EuroVelo system.[177]\n\n\nCrime in Budapest is investigated by different bodies. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes in their 2011 Global Study on Homicide that, according to criminal justice sources, the homicide rate in Hungary, calculated based on UN population estimates, was 1.4 in 2009, compared to Canada's rate of 1.8 that same year.[178]\nThe homicide rate in Budapest is below the EU capital cities' average according to WHO also.[179] However, organised crime is associated with the city, the Institute of Defence in a UN study named Budapest as one of the \"global epicentres\" of illegal pornography, money laundering and contraband tobacco, and also a negotiation center for international crime group leaders.[180]\n\n\n\n### City governance[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Budapest, Lord Mayor of Budapest, and General Assembly of Budapest\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Composition of the 33 seats in the General Assembly**\n |\n|  | **Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union** | 13 seats\n |\n|  | **Hungarian Socialist Party** | 5 seats\n |\n|  | **Momentum** | 3 seats\n |\n|  | **Democratic Coalition** | 7 seats\n |\n|  | **Dialogue for Hungary** | Mayor + 1 seat\n |\n|  | **Independent** | 3 seats\n |\n\n\n![](image)Central City Hall\nBudapest has been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor-council form of government since its consolidation in 1873, but Budapest also holds a special status as a county-level government, and also special within that, as holds a capital-city territory status.[181] In Budapest, the central government is responsible for the urban planning, statutory planning, public transport, housing, waste management, municipal taxes, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, among others. The Mayor is responsible for all city services, police and fire protection, enforcement of all city and state laws within the city, and administration of public property and most public agencies. Besides, each of Budapest' twenty-three districts has its own town hall and a directly elected council and the directly elected mayor of district.[2]\n\n\nThe Mayor of Budapest is Gergely Karácsony who was elected on 13 October 2019. The mayor and members of General Assembly are elected to five-year terms.[2]\nThe Budapest General Assembly is a unicameral body consisting of 33 members, which consist of the 23 mayors of the districts, 9 from the electoral lists of political parties, plus Mayor of Budapest (the Mayor is elected directly). Each term for the mayor and assembly members lasts five years.[182] Submitting the budget of Budapest is the responsibility of the Mayor and the deputy-mayor in charge of finance. The latest, 2014 budget was approved with 18 supporting votes from ruling Fidesz and 14 votes against by the opposition lawmakers.[183]\n\n\n\n## Main sights and tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of sights and historic places in Budapest and List of tourist attractions in Budapest\n\nBudapest is widely known for its well-kept pre-war cityscape, with a great variety of streets and landmarks in classical architecture.\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the capital is the neo-Gothic Parliament, the biggest building in Hungary with its 268 metres (879 ft) length, also holding (since 2001) the Hungarian Crown Jewels.\n\n\nSaint Stephen's Basilica is the most important religious building of the city, where the Holy Right Hand of Hungary's first king, Saint Stephen is on display as well.\n\n\nThe Hungarian cuisine and café culture can be seen and tasted in a lot of places, like Gerbeaud Café, the *Százéves*, *Biarritz*, *Fortuna*, *Alabárdos*, *Arany Szarvas*, *Kárpátia* and the world-famous Mátyás-pince [hu] restaurants and beer bars.\n\n\nThere are Roman remains at the Aquincum Museum, and historic furniture at the Nagytétény Castle Museum, just 2 out of 223 museums in Budapest. Another historical museum is the House of Terror, hosted in the building that was the venue of the Nazi Headquarters. The Castle Hill, the River Danube embankments and the whole of Andrássy út have been officially recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\nCastle Hill and the Castle District; there are three churches here, six museums, and a host of interesting buildings, streets and squares. The former Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Hungary – and has been the scene of battles and wars ever since the 13th century. Nowadays it houses two museums and the National Széchenyi Library. The nearby Sándor Palace contains the offices and official residence of the President of Hungary. The seven-hundred-year-old Matthias Church is one of the jewels of Budapest, it is in neo-Gothic style, decorated with coloured shingles and elegant pinnacles. Next to it is an equestrian statue of the first king of Hungary, King Saint Stephen, and behind that is the Fisherman's Bastion, built in 1905 by the architect Frigyes Schulek, the Fishermen's Bastions owes its name to the namesake corporation that during the Middle Ages was responsible of the defence of this part of ramparts, from where opens out a panoramic view of the whole city. Statues of the Turul, the mythical guardian bird of Hungary, can be found in both the Castle District and the Twelfth District.\n\n\nIn Pest, arguably the most important sight is Andrássy út. This Avenue is an elegant 2.5 kilometres (2 miles) long tree-lined street that covers the distance from Deák Ferenc tér to the Heroes Square. This Avenue overlooks many important sites. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As far as Kodály körönd and Oktogon both sides are lined with large shops and flats built close together. Between there and Heroes' Square the houses are detached and altogether grander. Under the whole runs continental Europe's oldest Underground railway, most of whose stations retain their original appearance. Heroes' Square is dominated by the Millenary Monument, with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front. To the sides are the Museum of Fine Arts and the Kunsthalle Budapest, and behind City Park opens out, with Vajdahunyad Castle. One of the jewels of Andrássy út is the Hungarian State Opera House. Statue Park, a theme park with striking statues of the Communist era, is located just outside the main city and is accessible by public transport.\n\n\nThe Dohány Street Synagogue is the largest synagogue in Europe, and the second largest active synagogue in the world.[184] The synagogue is located in the Jewish district taking up several blocks in central Budapest bordered by Király utca, Wesselényi utca, Grand Boulevard and Bajcsy Zsilinszky road. It was built in moorish revival style in 1859 and has a seating capacity of 3,000. Adjacent to it is a sculpture reproducing a weeping willow tree in steel to commemorate the Hungarian victims of the Holocaust.\n\n\nThe city is also home to the largest medicinal bath in Europe (Széchenyi Medicinal Bath) and the third largest Parliament building in the world, once the largest in the world. Other attractions are the bridges of the capital. Seven bridges provide crossings over the Danube, and from north to south are: the Árpád Bridge (built in 1950 at the north of Margaret Island); the Margaret Bridge (built in 1901, destroyed during the war by an explosion and then rebuilt in 1948); the Chain Bridge (built in 1849, destroyed during World War II and then rebuilt in 1949); the Elisabeth Bridge (completed in 1903 and dedicated to the murdered Queen Elisabeth, it was destroyed by the Germans during the war and replaced with a new bridge in 1964); the Liberty Bridge (opened in 1896 and rebuilt in 1989 in Art Nouveau style); the Petőfi Bridge (completed in 1937, destroyed during the war and rebuilt in 1952); the Rákóczi Bridge (completed in 1995). Most remarkable for their beauty are the Margaret Bridge, the Chain Bridge and the Liberty Bridge. The world's largest panorama photograph was created in (and of) Budapest in 2010.[185]\n\n\nTourists visiting Budapest can receive free maps and information from the nonprofit Budapest Festival and Tourism Center at its info-points.[186] The info centers also offer the Budapest Card which allows free public transit and discounts for several museums, restaurants and other places of interest. Cards are available for 24-, 48- or 72-hour durations.[187] The city is also well known for its ruin bars both day and night.[188]\n\n\n\n* ![Well-preserved Baroque University Church](image)\n\nWell-preserved Baroque University Church\n* ![Boscolo Budapest Hotel, café in the ground floor, a 107-room hotel above](image)\n\nBoscolo Budapest Hotel, café in the ground floor, a 107-room hotel above\n* ![Interior of Gerbeaud Café](image)\n\nInterior of Gerbeaud Café\n* ![Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles, and Chief Rabbi Róbert Frölich in the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe](image)\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles, and Chief Rabbi Róbert Frölich in the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe\n\n\n### Squares[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Holy Trinity column in the Holy Trinity Square, Buda Castle Hill\nIn Budapest there are many smaller and larger squares, the most significant of which are Heroes' Square, Kossuth Square, Liberty Square, St. Stephen's Square, Ferenc Deák Square, Vörösmarty Square, Erzsébet Square, St. George's Square and Széchenyi István Square. The Heroes' Square at the end of Andrássy Avenue is the largest and most influential square in the capital, with the Millennium Monument in the center, and the Museum of Fine Arts and The Hall of Art. Kossuth Square is a symbolic place of the Hungarian statehood, the Hungarian Parliament Building, the Palace of Justice and the Ministry of Agriculture. The Liberty Square is located in the Belváros-Lipótváros District (Inner City District), as one of Budapest's most beautiful squares. There are buildings such as the Hungarian National Bank, the embassy of the United States, the Stock Exchange Palace, as well as numerous statues and monuments such as the Soviet War Memorial, the Statue of Ronald Reagan or the controversial Monument to the victims of the German occupation. In the St. Stephen's Square is the St. Stephen's Basilica, the square is connected by a walking street, the Zrínyi Street, to the Széchenyi István Square at the foot of The Chain Bridge. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Gresham Palace and the Ministry of Interior are also located here. Deák Ferenc Square is a central square of the capital, a major transport hub, where three Budapest subways meet. Here is the oldest and best known Evangelical Church of Budapest, the Deák Ferenc Square Lutheran Church. Vörösmarty Square is located in Belváros-Lipótváros District (Inner City District) behind the Vigadó of Pest as one of the endpoints of Váci Street. The Confectionery Gerbeaud is here, and the annual Christmas Fair is held in the Square, as well as is the centre of the Holiday Book Week.\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Parks in Budapest\n\n![](image)The City Park Ice Rink, located in the City Park; the Vajdahunyad Castle is in the background.\nBudapest has many municipal parks and most have playgrounds for children and seasonal activities like skating in the winter and boating in the summer. Access from the city center is quick and easy with the Millennium Underground. Budapest has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the Budapest City Gardening Ltd.[189]\nThe wealth of greenspace afforded by Budapest's parks is further augmented by a network of open spaces containing forest, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie not far from the inner city, including the Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden (established in 1866) in the City Park.[190]\nThe most notable and popular parks in Budapest are the City Park which was established in 1751 (302 acres) along with Andrássy Avenue,[191] the Margaret Island in the Danube (238 acres or 96 hectares),[192] the People's Park, the Római Part, and the Kopaszi Dam.[193]\n\n\nThe Buda Hills also offer a variety of outdoor activities and views. A place frequented by locals is Normafa, offering activities for all seasons. With a modest ski run, it is also used by skiers and snow boarders – if there is enough snowfall in winter.\n\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Park on Margaret Island\n![](image)Aerial panorama with Margaret Island\nA number of islands can be found on the Danube in Budapest:\n\n\n\n* Margaret Island (Hungarian: *Margit-sziget* [ˈmɒrɡit.siɡɛt]) is a 2.5 km (1.6 mi) long island and 0.965 square kilometres (238 acres) in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between Margaret Bridge (south) and Árpád Bridge (north). Dance clubs, swimming pools, an aqua park, athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting. In the summer (generally on the weekends) mostly young people go to the island at night to party on its terraces, or to recreate with a bottle of alcohol on a bench or on the grass (this form of entertainment is sometimes referred to as bench-partying).\n* Csepel Island (Hungarian: *Csepel-sziget* [ˈt͡ʃɛpɛlsiɡɛt]) is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is 48 km (30 mi) long; its width is 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) and its area comprises 257 km2 (99 sq mi). However, only the northern tip of the island is inside the city limits.\n* Hajógyári Island (Hungarian: *Hajógyári-sziget* [ˈhɒjoːɟaːrisiɡɛt]), also known as Óbuda Island (Hungarian: *Óbudai-sziget*), is a human-made island located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and dance clubs during the night. This is the island where the famous Sziget Festival takes place, hosting hundreds of performances per year. Around 400,000 visitors attended the last festival. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe. The plan is to build apartment buildings, hotels, casinos and a marina.\n* Molnár Island [hu] (Hungarian: *Molnár-sziget*) is an island in the channel of the Danube that separates Csepel Island from the east bank of the river.\n\n\nThe islands of Palotai Island [hu], Nép Island [hu], and Háros Island [hu] also formerly existed within the city, but have been joined to the mainland.\n\n\nThe Ínség Rock [hu] (Hungarian: *Ínség-szikla*) is a reef in the Danube close to the shore under the Gellért Hill. It is only exposed during drought periods when the river level is very low.\n\n\nJust outside the city boundary to the north lies the large Szentendre Island (Hungarian: *Szentendrei-sziget*) and the much smaller Lupa Island (Hungarian: *Lupa-sziget*).\n\n\n\n### Spas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Széchenyi Thermal Bath in the City Park\nOne of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could use and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.[194][195]\n\n\nBudapest gained its reputation as a city of spas in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a \"City of Spas\". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the \"Magic Bath\" and \"Cinetrip\" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.\n\n\nConstruction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.\n\n\nThe Rudas Baths are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a 10 metres (33 ft) diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.\n\n\n\n![](image)Gate of the Gellért Spa\nThe Gellért Baths and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.\n\n\nThe Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.\n\n\nThe Széchenyi Baths are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only \"old\" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. The Szécheny Baths are built in modern Renaissance style.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNight panorama of the Gellért Hill with the illuminated Buda Castle, Matthias Church, Danube Chain Bridge, Parliament, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest Eye, and Vigadó Concert Hall\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Budapest with Gellért Hill, Liberty Statue, Budapest Eye, Buda Castle, Matthias Church, Parliament, St. Stephen's Basilica\n\n## Infrastructure and transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport\n\n![](image)Budapest International Airport arrivals and departures lounge between terminal 2A and 2B, named SkyCourt\nBudapest is served by Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) (named after Franz Liszt, the notable Hungarian composer), one of the busiest airports in Central and Eastern Europe, located 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) east-southeast of the centre of Budapest, in the District XVIII. The airport offers international connections among all major European cities, and also to North America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\nAs Hungary's busiest airport, it handles nearly all of the country's air passenger traffic. Budapest Liszt Ferenc handled around 250 scheduled flights daily in 2013, and an ever-rising number of charters. London, Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, and Amsterdam are the busiest international connections respectively, while Toronto, Montreal, Dubai, Doha and Alicante are the most unusual in the region.[196]\nToday the airport serves as a base for Ryanair, Wizz Air, Budapest Aircraft Service, CityLine Hungary, Farnair Hungary and Travel Service Hungary among others. The airport is accessible via public transportation from the city centre by the Metro line 3 and then the airport bus No. 200E.[197]\n\n\nAs part of a strategic development plan, €561 million have been spent on expanding and modernising the airport infrastructure until December 2012. Most of these improvements are already completed,[198] the postponed ones are the new cargo area and new piers for terminal 2A and 2B, but these development are on standby also, and will start immediately, when the airport traffic will reach the appropriate level.\nSkyCourt, the newest, state-of-the-art building between the 2A and 2B terminals with 5 levels. Passenger safety checks were moved here along with new baggage classifiers and the new Malév and SkyTeam business lounges, as well as the first MasterCard lounge in Europe.[199]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Budapest metro and rapid transit network within the city and to suburbs\n![](image)Green Line 4, a driverless metro line with real-time PIDS system at Kálvin square, a transfer station to Blue Line 3\n![](image)CAF Tram on Line 17 at Széll Kálmán Square\nPublic transit in Budapest is provided by the Centre for Budapest Transport (BKK, *Budapesti Közlekedési Központ*), one of the largest transportation authorities in Europe.[200] BKK operates 4 metro lines (including the historic Line 1, the oldest underground railway in continental Europe), 5 suburban railway lines, 33 tram lines, 15 trolleybus lines, 264 bus lines (including 40 night routes), 4 boat services, and *BuBi*, a smart bicycle sharing network. On an average weekday, BKK lines transports 3.9 million riders; in 2011, it handled a total of 1.4 billion passengers.[201] In 2014, the 65% of the passenger traffic in Budapest was by public transport and 35% by car. The aim is 80%–20% by 2030 in accordance with the strategy of BKK.[202]\n\n\nCitizens of the European Union, the European Economic Area and Switzerland who are at least 65 years old can use the public transport for free.[203]\n\n\nThe development of complex intelligent transportation system in the city is advancing; the application of smart traffic lights is widespread, they are GPS and computer controlled and give priority to the GPS connected public transport vehicles automatically, as well as the traffic is measured and analyzed on the roads and car drivers informed about the expected travel time and traffic by intelligent displays (EasyWay project).[204] Public transport users are immediately notified of any changes in public transport online, on smartphones and on PIDS displays, as well car drivers can keep track of changes in traffic and road management in real-time online and on smartphones through the *BKK Info*.[205][206] As well all vehicles can be followed online and on smartphones in real-time throughout the city with the *Futár* PIDS system,[207] while the continuous introducing of integrated e-ticket system will help the measurement of passenger numbers on each line and the intelligent control of service frequency.\n\n\nThe development of *Futár*, the citywide real-time passenger information system and real-time route planner is finished already and now all of the public transport vehicle is connected via satellite system. The real-time information of trams, buses and trolleybuses are available for both the operators in the control room and for all the passengers in all stops on smartphone and on city street displays.[208] The implementation of latest generation automated fare collection and e-ticket system with NFC compatibility and reusable contactless smart cards for making electronic payments in online and offline systems in Budapest is started in 2014, the project is implemented and operated by the operator of Hong Kong Octopus card jointly with one of the leading European companies of e-ticket and automated fare collection, Scheidt & Bachmann.[209] The deployment of 300 new digital contactless ticket vending machine will be finished by the end of 2014 in harmonization with the e-ticket system.[210]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Volvo 7900A Hybrid in Budapest on Line 5 operated by BKK\nTram lines no. 4 and 6 are the busiest city tram lines in the world,[211] with one of the world's longest trams (54-metre long Siemens Combino) running at 2–3-minute intervals at peak time and 4–5 minutes off-peak. Day services are usually from 4 am until between 11 pm and 0:30 am.[176] Hungarian State Railways operates an extensive network of commuter rail services, their importance in the suburban commuter passenger traffic is significant, but in travel within the city is limited.\nThe organiser of public transport in Budapest is the municipal corporation *Centre for Budapest Transport* (Budapesti Közlekedési Központ – BKK), that is responsible for planning and organising network and services, planning and developing tariff concepts, attending to public service procurer duties, managing public service contracts, operating controlling and monitoring systems, setting and monitoring service level agreements related to public transport, attending to customer service duties, selling and monitoring tickets and passes, attending to integrated passenger information duties, unified Budapest-centric traffic control within public transport, attending to duties related to river navigation, plus the management of Budapest roads, operating taxi stations, unified control of bicycle traffic development in the capital, preparing parking strategy and developing an operational concept, preparation of road traffic management, developing an optimal traffic management system, organising and co-ordinating road reconstruction and more, in short, everything which is related to transport in the city.[212]\n\n\n\n### Roads and railways[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hungarian State Railways and Motorways in Hungary\n\n![](image)Western railway station\n![](image)Megyeri Bridge on M0 highway ring road around Budapest\n![](image)Keleti Railway Station (Budapest East Central)\nBudapest is the most important Hungarian road terminus, all of the major highways and railways end within the city limits. The road system in the city is designed in a similar manner to that of Paris, with several ring roads, and avenues radiating out from the center. Ring road M0 around Budapest is nearly completed, with only one section missing on the west side due to local disputes. The ring road is 80 kilometres (50 miles) in length, and once finished it will be 107 kilometres (66 mi) of highway in length.\n\n\nThe city is a vital traffic hub because all major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest.[91] The Danube was and is still today an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes.[94]\nHungarian main line railways are operated by Hungarian State Railways. There are three main railway station in Budapest, Keleti (*Eastern*), Nyugati (*Western*) and Déli (*Southern*), operating both domestic and international rail services. Budapest is one of the main stops of the on its Central and Eastern European route.[213] There is also a suburban rail service in and around Budapest, three lines of which are operated under the name HÉV.\n\n\n\n### Ports, shipping and others[edit]\n\n\nThe river Danube flows through Budapest on its way from (Germany) to the Black Sea. The river is easily navigable and so Budapest historically has a major commercial port at Csepel District and at New Pest District also. The Pest side is also a famous port place with international shipping ports for cargo[214] and for passenger ships.[215] In the summer months, a scheduled hydrofoil service operates on the Danube connecting the city to Vienna.\n\n\nBKK (through the operator BKV) also provides public transport with boat service within the borders of the city. Two routes, marked D11 and D12, connect the two banks with Margaret Island and Óbuda Island, from Rómaifürdő (Buda side, north to Óbuda Island) or Árpád Bridge (Pest side) to Rákóczi Bridge, with a total of 18 stops, while route D2 circulates in the downtown.[216] Line D14 is a ferry service, connecting Királyerdő on the Csepel Island with Molnár Island on the Pest side, south to the city centre.[216] In addition, several companies provides sightseeing boat trips and also an amphibious vehicle (bus and boat) operates constantly.\n\n\nWater quality in Budapest harbours improved dramatically in the recent years, treatment facilities processed 100% of generated sewage in 2010. Budapesters regularly kayak, canoe, jet-ski and sail on the Danube, which has continuously become a major recreational site for the city.\n\n\nSpecial vehicles in Budapest, besides metros, include suburban rails, trams and boats. There are a couple of less common vehicles in Budapest, like the trolleybus on several lines in Pest, the Castle Hill Funicular between the Chain Bridge and Buda Castle, the cyclecar for rent in Margaret Island, the chairlift, the Budapest Cog-wheel Railway and children's railway. The latter three vehicles run among Buda hills.\n\n\n\n## Culture and contemporary life[edit]\n\n\nMain pages: Category:Culture in Budapest and Culture of Hungary\n\n![](image)Hungarian Academy of Sciences seat in Budapest, founded in 1825 by Count István Széchenyi\nThe culture of Budapest is reflected by Budapest's size and variety.

Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine. Considerable numbers of Saxons, Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different nougats, like white nougat called *törökméz*), quince (*birsalma*), Turkish delight, Turkish coffee or rice dishes like pilaf, meat and vegetable dishes like the eggplant, used in eggplant salads and appetizers, stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called *töltött káposzta*. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by Austrian cuisine under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.[227]\n\n\nBudapest restaurants reflect diversity, with menus carrying traditional regional cuisine, fusions of various culinary influences, or innovating in the leading edge of new techniques. Budapest' food shops also have a solid reputation for supplying quality specialised culinary products and supplies, reputations that are often built up over generations. These include many shops, such as Café Gerbeaud, one of the greatest and most traditional coffeehouses in Europe, or the Gundel restaurant and gastro shop in the City Park.\nFoodies can also find the highest quality foods served in several Michelin-starred restaurants, like Onyx, Costes, Borkonyha or Tanti.\n\n\n\n### In fiction[edit]\n\n\nThe 1906 novel *The Paul Street Boys*, the 1937 novel *Journey by Moonlight*, the 1957 book *The Bridge at Andau*, the 1975 novel *Fateless*, the 1977 novel *The End of a Family Story*, the 1986 book *Between the Woods and the Water*, the 1992 novel *Under the Frog*, the 1987 novel *The Door*, the 2002 novel *Prague*, the 2003 book *Budapeste*, the 2004 novel *Ballad of the Whisky Robber*, the 2005 novels *Parallel Stories* and *The Historian*, the 2012 novel *Budapest Noir* are set, amongst others, partly or entirely in Budapest.

It is the ninth-largest city in the European Union by population within city limits and the largest city on the Danube river;[14][15][16] the city has an estimated population of 1,752,286 over a land area of about 525 square kilometres (203 square miles).[17] Budapest, which is both a city and county, forms the centre of the Budapest metropolitan area, which has an area of 7,626 square kilometres (2,944 square miles) and a population of 3,303,786. It is a primate city, constituting 33% of the population of Hungary.[18][19]\n\n\nThe history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum,[20][21] the capital of Lower Pannonia.[20] The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century,[22] but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in 1241–42.[23] Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century.[24][25][26] The Battle of Mohács, in 1526, was followed by nearly 150 years of Ottoman rule.[27] After the reconquest of Buda in 1686, the region entered a new age of prosperity, with Pest-Buda becoming a global city after the unification of Buda, Óbuda and Pest on 17 November 1873, with the name 'Budapest' given to the new capital.[17][28] Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,[29] a great power that dissolved in 1918, following World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and the Battle of Budapest in 1945, as well as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.[30][31]\n\n\nBudapest is a global city with strengths in commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment.[32][33] Hungary's financial centre, Budapest is also the headquarters of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology,[34] the European Police College[35] and the first foreign office of the China Investment Promotion Agency.[36] Over 40 colleges and universities are located in Budapest, including Eötvös Loránd University, Corvinus University, Semmelweis University, University of Veterinary Medicine Budapest and the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.[37][38] Opened in 1896,[39] the city's subway system, the Budapest Metro, serves 1.27 million, while the Budapest Tram Network serves 1.08 million passengers daily.[40]\n\n\nThe central area of Budapest along the Danube River is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has several notable monuments of classical architecture, including the Hungarian Parliament and the Buda Castle.[41] The city also has around 80 geothermal springs,[42] the largest thermal water cave system,[43] second largest synagogue, and third largest Parliament building in the world.[44] Budapest attracts around 12 million international tourists per year, making it a highly popular destination in Europe.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and pronunciation[edit]\n\n\nThe previously separate towns of Buda, Óbuda, and Pest were officially unified in 1873[46] and given the new name *Budapest*. Before this, the towns together had sometimes been referred to colloquially as \"Pest-Buda\".[47][48] *Pest* is used *pars pro toto* for the entire city in contemporary colloquial Hungarian.[47]\n\n\nAll varieties of English pronounce the *-s-* as in the English word *pest*. The *-u* in *Buda-* is pronounced either /u/ like *food* (as in US: /ˈbuːdəpɛst/[49]) or /ju/ like *cue* (as in UK: /ˌb(j)uːdəˈpɛst, ˌbʊd-, ˈb(j)uːdəpɛst, ˈbʊd-/). In Hungarian, the *-s-* is pronounced /ʃ/ as in *wash*; in IPA: Hungarian: [ˈbudɒpɛʃt] ⓘ.\n\n\nThe origins of the names \"Buda\" and \"Pest\" are obscure. Buda was\n\n\n\n* probably the name of the first constable of the fortress built on the Castle Hill in the 11th century[50]\n* or a derivative of *Bod* or *Bud*, a personal name of Turkic origin, meaning 'twig'.[51]\n* or a Slavic personal name, *Buda*, the short form of *Budimír*, *Budivoj*.[52]\n\n\nLinguistically, however, a German origin through the Slavic derivative вода (*voda*, water) is not possible, and there is no certainty that a Turkic word really comes from the word *buta* ~ *buda* 'branch, twig'.[53]\n\n\nAccording to a legend recorded in chronicles from the Middle Ages, \"Buda\" comes from the name of its founder, Bleda, brother of Hunnic ruler Attila.\n\n\n\n\n> Attila went in the city of Sicambria in Pannonia, where he killed Buda, his brother, and he threw his corpse into the Danube. For while Attila was in the west, his brother crossed the boundaries in his reign, because he named Sicambria after his own name Buda's Castle. And though King Attila forbade the Huns and the other peoples to call that city Buda's Castle, but he called it Attila's Capital, the Germans who were terrified by the prohibition named the city as Eccylburg, which means Attila Castle, however, the Hungarians did not care about the ban and call it Óbuda [Old Buda] and call it to this day.\n> \n> — Mark of Kalt: *Chronicon Pictum*[54]\n> \n\n\n\n> The Scythians are certainly an ancient people and the strength of Scythia lies in the east, as we said above. And the first king of Scythia was Magog, son of Japhet, and his people were called Magyars [Hungarians] after their King Magog, from whose royal line the most renowned and mighty King Attila descended, who, in the 451st year of Our Lord's birth, coming down from Scythia, entered Pannonia with a mighty force and, putting the Romans to flight, took the realm and made a royal residence for himself beside the Danube above the hot springs, and he ordered all the old buildings that he found there to be restored and he built them in a circular and very strong wall that in the Hungarian language is now called Budavár [Buda Castle] and by the Germans Etzelburg [Attila Castle]\n> \n> — Anonymus: *Gesta Hungarorum*[55]\n> \n\n\nThere are several theories about Pest. One[56] states that the name derives from Roman times, since there was a local fortress (Contra-Aquincum) called by Ptolemy \"Pession\" (\"Πέσσιον\", iii.7.§ 2).[57] Another has it that Pest originates in the Slavic word for cave, *пещера*, or *peštera*. A third cites *пещ*, or *pešt*, referencing a cave where fires burned or a limekiln.[58]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Budapest\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Budapest.\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buda during the Middle Ages, woodcut from the Nuremberg Chronicle (1493)\nThe first settlement on the territory of Budapest was built by Celts[20] before 1 AD. It was later occupied by the Romans. The Roman settlement – Aquincum – became the main city of Pannonia Inferior in 106 AD.[20] At first it was a military settlement, and gradually the city rose around it, making it the focal point of the city's commercial life. Today this area corresponds to the Óbuda district within Budapest.[59] The Romans constructed roads, amphitheaters, baths and houses with heated floors in this fortified military camp.[60] The Roman city of Aquincum is the best-conserved of the Roman sites in Hungary. The archaeological site was turned into a museum with indoor and open-air sections.[61]\n\n\nThe Magyar tribes led by Árpád, forced out of their original homeland north of Bulgaria by Tsar Simeon after the Battle of Southern Buh, settled in the territory at the end of the 9th century displacing the founding Bulgarian settlers of the towns of Buda and Pest,[22][62] and a century later officially founded the Kingdom of Hungary.[22] Research places the probable residence of the Árpáds as an early place of central power near what became Budapest.[63] The Tatar invasion in the 13th century quickly proved it is difficult to defend a plain.[17][22] King Béla IV of Hungary, therefore, ordered the construction of reinforced stone walls around the towns[22] and set his own royal palace on the top of the protecting hills of Buda. In 1361 it became the capital of Hungary.[23][17]\n\n\nThe cultural role of Buda was particularly significant during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The Italian Renaissance had a great influence on the city. His library, the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles and philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second in size only to the Vatican Library.[17] After the foundation of the first Hungarian university in Pécs in 1367 (University of Pécs), the second one was established in Óbuda in 1395 (University of Óbuda).[64] The first Hungarian book was printed in Buda in 1473.[65] Buda had about 5,000 inhabitants around the year 1500.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Retaking of Buda from the Ottoman Empire*, painted by Frans Geffels in 1686\nThe Ottomans conquered Buda in 1526, as well in 1529, and finally occupied it in 1541.[67] The Turkish Rule lasted for more than 150 years.[17] The Ottoman Turks constructed many prominent bathing facilities within the city.[22] Some of the baths that the Turks erected during their rule are still in use 500 years later (Rudas Baths and Király Baths). By 1547 the number of Christians was down to about a thousand, and by 1647 it had fallen to only about seventy.[66] The unoccupied western part of the country became part of the Habsburg monarchy as Royal Hungary.\n\n\nIn 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed campaign was started to enter Buda. This time, the Holy League's army was twice as large, containing over 74,000 men, including German, Croat, Dutch, Hungarian, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers, along with other Europeans as volunteers, artillerymen, and officers. The Christian forces seized Buda, and in the next few years, all of the former Hungarian lands, except areas near Temesvár (Timișoara), were taken from the Turks. In the 1699 Treaty of Karlowitz, these territorial changes were officially recognized as the end of the rule of the Turks, and in 1718 the entire Kingdom of Hungary was removed from Ottoman rule.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history after Unification[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hungary during World War II\n\n![](image)Millennium Underground (1894–1896), the second oldest metro in the world (after the Metropolitan line of the London Underground)\n![](image)The Hungarian revolutionary army liberates the Buda castle in May 1849.\nThe 19th century was dominated by the Hungarian struggle for independence[17] and modernisation. The national insurrection against the Habsburgs began in the Hungarian capital in 1848 and was defeated one and a half years later, with the help of the Russian Empire. 1867 was the year of Reconciliation that brought about the birth of Austria-Hungary. This made Budapest the twin capital of a dual monarchy. It was this compromise which opened the second great phase of development in the history of Budapest, lasting until World War I. In 1849 the Chain Bridge linking Buda with Pest was opened as the first permanent bridge across the Danube[68] and in 1873 Buda and Pest were officially merged with the third part, Óbuda (Old Buda), thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into the country's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Ethnic Hungarians overtook Germans in the second half of the 19th century due to mass migration from the overpopulated rural Transdanubia and Great Hungarian Plain. Between 1851 and 1910 the proportion of Hungarians increased from 35.6% to 85.9%, Hungarian became the dominant language, and German was crowded out. The proportion of Jews peaked in 1900 with 23.6%.[69][70][71] Due to the prosperity and the large Jewish community of the city at the start of the 20th century, Budapest was often called the \"Jewish Mecca\"[23] or \"Judapest\".[72][73] Budapest also became an important center for the Aromanian diaspora during the 19th century.[74] In 1918, Austria-Hungary lost the war and collapsed; Hungary declared itself an independent republic (Republic of Hungary). In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon partitioned the country, and as a result, Hungary lost over two-thirds of its territory, and about two-thirds of its inhabitants, including 3.3 million out of 15 million ethnic Hungarians.[75][76]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hungarian State Opera House, built in the time of Austria-Hungary\n![](image)Bond of the City of Budapest, issued 1 May 1911\n![](image)The Chain Bridge was destroyed during the Siege of Budapest.\n![](image)Soviet tanks in Budapest (1956)\nIn 1944, a year before the end of World War II, Budapest was partly destroyed by British and American air raids (first attack 4 April 1944[77][78][79]).\nFrom 24 December 1944 to 13 February 1945, the city was besieged during the Battle of Budapest. Budapest sustained major damage caused by the attacking Soviet and Romanian troops and the defending German and Hungarian troops. More than 38,000 civilians died during the conflict. All bridges were destroyed by the Germans. The stone lions that have decorated the Chain Bridge since 1852 survived the devastation of the war.[80]\n\n\nBetween 20% and 40% of Greater Budapest's 250,000 Jewish inhabitants died through Nazi and Arrow Cross Party, during the German occupation of Hungary, from 1944 to early 1945.[81]\n\n\nSwiss diplomat Carl Lutz rescued tens of thousands of Jews by issuing Swiss protection papers and designating numerous buildings, including the now famous Glass House (Üvegház) at Vadász Street 29, to be Swiss protected territory. About 3,000 Hungarian Jews found refuge at the Glass House and in a neighboring building. Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg saved the lives of tens of thousands of Jews in Budapest by giving them Swedish protection papers and taking them under his consular protection.[82] Wallenberg was abducted by the Russians on 17 January 1945 and never regained freedom. Giorgio Perlasca, an Italian citizen, saved thousands of Hungarian Jews posing as a Spanish diplomat.[83][84] Some other diplomats also abandoned diplomatic protocol and rescued Jews. There are two monuments for Wallenberg, one for Carl Lutz and one for Giorgio Perlasca in Budapest.\n\n\nFollowing the capture of Hungary from Nazi Germany by the Red Army, Soviet military occupation ensued, which ended only in 1991. The Soviets exerted significant influence on Hungarian political affairs. In 1949, Hungary was declared a communist People's Republic (People's Republic of Hungary). The new Communist government considered the buildings like the Buda Castle symbols of the former regime, and during the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the interiors were destroyed (also see Stalin era).\nOn 23 October 1956 citizens held a large peaceful demonstration in Budapest demanding democratic reform. The demonstrators went to the Budapest radio station and demanded to publish their demands. The regime ordered troops to shoot into the crowd. Hungarian soldiers gave rifles to the demonstrators who were now able to capture the building. This initiated the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The demonstrators demanded to appoint Imre Nagy to be Prime Minister of Hungary. To their surprise, the central committee of the \"Hungarian Working People's Party\" did so that same evening. This uprising was an anti-Soviet revolt that lasted from 23 October until 11 November. After Nagy had declared that Hungary was to leave the Warsaw Pact and become neutral, Soviet tanks and troops entered the country to crush the revolt. Fighting continued until mid November, leaving more than 3000 dead. A monument was erected at the fiftieth anniversary of the revolt in 2006, at the edge of the City Park. Its shape is a wedge with a 56 angle degree made in rusted iron that gradually becomes shiny, ending in an intersection to symbolize Hungarian forces that temporarily eradicated the Communist leadership.[85]\n\n\nFrom the 1960s to the late 1980s Hungary was often satirically referred to as \"the happiest barrack\" within the Eastern bloc, and much of the wartime damage to the city was finally repaired. Work on Erzsébet Bridge, the last to be rebuilt, was finished in 1964. In the early 1970s, Budapest Metro's east–west M2 line was first opened, followed by the M3 line in 1976. In 1987, Buda Castle and the banks of the Danube were included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. Andrássy Avenue (including the Millennium Underground Railway, Hősök tere, and Városliget) was added to the UNESCO list in 2002. In the 1980s, the city's population reached 2.1 million. In recent times a significant decrease in population occurred mainly due to a massive movement to the neighbouring agglomeration in Pest county, i.e., suburbanisation.[86]\n\n\nIn the last decades of the 20th century the political changes of 1989–90 (Fall of the Iron Curtain) concealed changes in civil society and along the streets of Budapest. The monuments of the dictatorship were removed from public places, into Memento Park. In the first 20 years of the new democracy, the development of the city was managed by its mayor, Gábor Demszky.[87]\n\n\nIn October 2019, opposition candidate Gergely Karácsony won the Budapest mayoral election, meaning the first electoral blow for Hungary's nationalist prime minister Viktor Orbán since coming to power in 2010.[88]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite imagery of Budapest\nBudapest, strategically placed at the centre of the Carpathian Basin, lies on an ancient route linking the hills of Transdanubia with the Great Plain. By road it is 216 kilometres (134 mi) south-east of Vienna, 545 kilometres (339 mi) south of Warsaw, 1,565 kilometres (972 mi) south-west of Moscow, 1,122 kilometres (697 mi) north of Athens, 788 kilometres (490 mi) north-east of Milan, and 443 kilometres (275 mi) south-east of Prague.[89]\n\n\nThe 525 square kilometres (203 sq mi) area of Budapest lies in Central Hungary, surrounded by settlements of the agglomeration in Pest county. The capital extends 25 and 29 km (16 and 18 mi) in the north–south, east–west direction respectively. The Danube enters the city from the north; later it encircles two islands, Óbuda Island and Margaret Island.[17] The third island Csepel Island is the largest of the Budapest Danube islands, however only its northernmost tip is within city limits. The river that separates the two parts of the city is 230 m (755 ft) wide at its narrowest point in Budapest. Pest lies on the flat terrain of the Great Plain while Buda is rather hilly.[17]\n\n\nThe wide Danube was always fordable at this point because of a small number of islands in the middle of the river. The city has marked topographical contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank.[90] Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill.[91]\n\n\nThe Buda hills consist mainly of limestone and dolomite, the water created speleothems, the most famous ones being the Pálvölgyi cave (total length 7,200 m or 23,600 ft) and the Szemlőhegyi cave (total length 2,200 m or 7,200 ft). The hills were formed in the Triassic Period. The highest point of the hills and of Budapest is János Hill, at 527 metres (1,729 feet) above sea level. The lowest point is the line of the Danube which is 96 metres (315 feet) above sea level. Budapest is also rich in green areas. Of the 525 square kilometres (203 square miles) occupied by the city, 83 square kilometres (32 square miles) is green area, park and forest.[92] The forests of Buda hills are environmentally protected.[93]\n\n\nThe city's importance in terms of traffic is very central, because many major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest.[91] The Danube was and is still an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes.[94]\nBudapest is one of only three capital cities in the world which has thermal springs (the others being Reykjavík in Iceland and Sofia in Bulgaria). Some 125 springs produce 70 million litres (15,000,000 imperial gallons; 18,000,000 US gallons) of thermal water a day, with temperatures ranging up to 58 Celsius. Some of these waters have been claimed to have medicinal effects due to their high mineral contents.[91]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Budapest\n\nBudapest has a humid subtropical climate.[95] Winter (November until early March) can be cold and the city receives little sunshine. Snowfall is fairly frequent in most years, and nighttime temperatures of −10 °C (14 °F) are not uncommon between mid-December and mid-February. The spring months (March and April) see variable conditions, with a rapid increase in the average temperature. The weather in late March and in April is often very agreeable during the day and fresh at night. Budapest's long summer – lasting from May until mid-September – is warm or very warm. Sudden heavy showers also occur, particularly in May and June. The autumn in Budapest (mid-September until late October) is characterised by little rain and long sunny days with moderate temperatures. Temperatures often turn abruptly colder in late October or early November.\n\n\nMean annual precipitation in Budapest is around 23.5 inches (596.9 mm). On average, there are 84 days with precipitation and 1988 hours of sunshine (of a possible 4383) each year.[3][96][97] From March to October, average sunshine totals are roughly equal to those seen in northern Italy (Venice).\n\n\nThe city lies on the boundary between Zone 6 and Zone 7 in terms of the hardiness zone.[98][99]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Budapest, 1991–2020\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 4.1(39.4)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 4.6(40.3)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 7.2(45.0)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 0.1(32.2)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 4.3(39.7)\n | −0.2(31.6)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −25.6(−14.1)\n | −23.4(−10.1)\n | −15.1(4.8)\n | −4.6(23.7)\n | −1.6(29.1)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.9(42.6)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −9.5(14.9)\n | −16.4(2.5)\n | −20.8(−5.4)\n | −25.6(−14.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 29(1.1)\n | 30(1.2)\n | 42(1.7)\n | 62(2.4)\n | 63(2.5)\n | 45(1.8)\n | 49(1.9)\n | 40(1.6)\n | 39(1.5)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 43(1.7)\n | 532(20.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 7.3\n | 6.1\n | 6.4\n | 6.6\n | 8.6\n | 8.7\n | 7.2\n | 6.9\n | 5.9\n | 5.3\n | 7.8\n | 7.2\n | 84\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 74\n | 66\n | 59\n | 61\n | 61\n | 59\n | 61\n | 67\n | 72\n | 78\n | 80\n | 68.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 62\n | 93\n | 137\n | 177\n | 234\n | 250\n | 271\n | 255\n | 187\n | 141\n | 69\n | 52\n | 1,988\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 8\n | 8\n | 7\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source: Average temperatures 1991-2020: OMSZ - Hungarian Meteorological Service.[100] |\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Buildings and structures in Budapest and List of churches in Budapest\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n**Clockwise, from upper left**: the ruins of the Celtic and Roman civil town of Aquincum; Romanesque 12th century Gercse Parish Church; the Buda Castle; Kós Károly Square in the Wekerletelep; Ottoman Tomb of Gül Baba; and Gothic Mary Magdalene Church\n\nBudapest has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles and from distinct time periods, from the ancient times as Roman City of Aquincum in Óbuda (District III), which dates to around 89 AD, to the most modern Palace of Arts, the contemporary arts museum and concert hall.[103][104][105]\n\n\nMost buildings in Budapest are relatively low: in the early 2010s there were around 100 buildings higher than 45 metres (148 ft). The number of high-rise buildings is kept low by building legislation, which is aimed at preserving the historic cityscape and to meet the requirements of the World Heritage Site. Strong rules apply to the planning, authorisation and construction of high-rise buildings and consequently much of the inner city does not have any. Some planners would like see an easing of the rules for the construction of skyscrapers, and the possibility of building skyscrapers outside the city's historic core has been raised.[106][107]\n\n\nIn the chronological order of architectural styles Budapest is represented on the entire timeline, starting with the Roman City of Aquincum representing ancient architecture.\n\n\nThe next determinative style is the Gothic architecture in Budapest. The few remaining Gothic buildings can be found in the Castle District. Buildings of note are no. 18, 20 and 22 on Országház Street, which date back to the 14th century and No. 31 Úri Street, which has a Gothic façade that dates back to the 15th century. Other buildings with Gothic features are the Inner City Parish Church, built in the 12th century,[108] and the Mary Magdalene Church, completed in the 15th century.[109] The most characteristic Gothic-style buildings are actually Neo-Gothic, like the most well-known Budapest landmarks, the Hungarian Parliament Building[110] and the Matthias Church, where much of the original material was used (originally built in Romanesque style in 1015).[111]\n\n\nThe next chapter in the history of human architecture is Renaissance architecture. One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was Hungary, and Budapest in particular. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons came to Buda with the new queen. Today, many of the original renaissance buildings disappeared during the varied history of Buda, but Budapest is still rich in renaissance and neo-renaissance buildings, like the famous Hungarian State Opera House, St. Stephen's Basilica and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.[112]\n\n\nDuring the Turkish occupation (1541–1686), Islamic culture flourished in Budapest; multiple mosques and baths were built in the city. These were great examples of Ottoman architecture, which was influenced by Muslims from around the world including Turkish, Iranian, Arabian and to a larger extent, Byzantine architecture as well as Islamic traditions. After the Holy League conquered Budapest, they replaced most of the mosques with churches and minarets were turned into bell towers and cathedral spires. At one point the distinct sloping central square in Budapest became a bustling Oriental bazaar, which was filled with \"the chatter of camel caravans on their way to Yemen and India\".[113] Budapest is in fact one of the few places in the world with functioning original Turkish bathhouses dating back to the 16th century, like Rudas Baths or Király Baths. Budapest is home to the northernmost place where the tomb of influential Islamic Turkish Sufi Dervish, Gül Baba is found. Various cultures converged in Hungary seemed to coalesce well with each other, as if all these different cultures and architecture styles are digested into Hungary's own way of cultural blend. A precedent to show the city's self-conscious is the top section of the city's main square, named as Szechenyi. When Turks came to the city, they built mosques here which was aggressively replaced with Gothic church of St. Bertalan. The rationale of reusing the base of the former Islamic building mosque and reconstruction into Gothic Church but Islamic style architecture over it is typically Islamic are still visible. An official term for the rationale is spolia. The mosque was called the djami of Pasha Gazi Kassim, and djami means mosque in Arabic. After Turks and Muslims were expelled and massacred from Budapest, the site was reoccupied by Christians and reformed into a church, the Inner City Parish Church (Budapest). The minaret and Turkish entranceway were removed. The shape of the architecture is its only hint of exotic past—\"two surviving prayer niches facing Mecca and an ecumenical symbol atop its cupola: a cross rising above the Turkish crescent moon\".[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The most famous Budapest bridge, the Chain Bridge, the icon of the city's 19th century development, built in 1849\nAfter 1686, the Baroque architecture designated the dominant style of art in catholic countries from the 17th century to the 18th century.[114] There are many Baroque-style buildings in Budapest and one of the finest examples of preserved Baroque-style architecture is the Church of St. Anna in Batthyhány square. An interesting part of Budapest is the less touristy Óbuda, the main square of which also has some beautiful preserved historic buildings with Baroque façades. The Castle District is another place to visit where the best-known landmark Buda Royal Palace and many other buildings were built in the Baroque style.[114]\n\n\nThe Classical architecture and Neoclassical architecture are the next in the timeline. Budapest had not one but two architects that were masters of the Classicist style. Mihály Pollack (1773–1855) and József Hild (1789–1867), built many beautiful Classicist-style buildings in the city. Some of the best examples are the Hungarian National Museum, the Lutheran Church of Budavár (both designed by Pollack) and the seat of the Hungarian president, the Sándor Palace. The most iconic and widely known Classicist-style attraction in Budapest is the Széchenyi Chain Bridge.[115] Budapest's two most beautiful Romantic architecture buildings are the Great Synagogue in Dohány Street and the Vigadó Concert Hall on the Danube Promenade, both designed by architect Frigyes Feszl (1821–1884). Another noteworthy structure is the Budapest Western Railway Station, which was designed by August de Serres and built by the Eiffel Company of Paris in 1877.[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hungarian Parliament, completed in 1904\nArt Nouveau came into fashion in Budapest by the exhibitions which were held in and around 1896 and organised in connection with the Hungarian Millennium celebrations.[117] Art Nouveau in Hungary (*Szecesszió* in Hungarian) is a blend of several architectural styles, with a focus on Hungary's specialities. One of the leading Art Nouveau architects, Ödön Lechner (1845–1914), was inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture as well as traditional Hungarian decorative designs. One of his most beautiful buildings in Budapest is the Museum of Applied Arts. Another examples for Art Nouveau in Budapest is the Gresham Palace in front of the Chain Bridge, the Hotel Gellért, the Franz Liszt Academy of Music or Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden.[103]\n\n\n\n> \n> It is one of the world's outstanding urban landscapes and illustrates the great periods in the history of the Hungarian capital.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*UNESCO*[118]\n\nThe second half of the 20th century also saw, under the communist regime, the construction of blocks of flats (panelház), as in other Eastern European countries. In the 21st century, Budapest faces new challenges in its architecture. The pressure towards the high-rise buildings is unequivocal among today's world cities, but preserving Budapest's unique cityscape and its very diverse architecture, along with green areas, is force Budapest to balance between them. The Contemporary architecture has wide margin in the city. Public spaces attract heavy investment by business and government also, so that the city has gained entirely new (or renovated and redesigned) squares, parks and monuments, for example the city central Kossuth Lajos square, Deák Ferenc square and Liberty Square. Numerous landmarks are created in the last decade in Budapest, like the National Theatre, Palace of Arts, Rákóczi Bridge, Megyeri Bridge, Budapest Airport Sky Court among others, and millions of square meters of new office buildings and apartments. But there are still large opportunities in real estate development in the city.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n**From left**: Saint Anne Parish; Matthias Church; Fisherman's Bastion; and Stigmatisation of Saint Francis Church\n\n## Districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts in Budapest\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Budapest's twenty-three districts overview**\n |\n| **Administration** | **Population** | **Area and Density** |\n| *District* | *Official name* | *Official 2013* | *Km2* | *People/km2* |\n| **I** | Várkerület | 24.528 | 3,41 | 7.233\n |\n| **II** | Rózsadomb | 88.011 | 36,34 | 2.426\n |\n| **III** | Óbuda-Békásmegyer | 123.889 | 39,69 | 3.117\n |\n| **IV** | Újpest | 99.050 | 18,82 | 5.227\n |\n| **V** | Belváros-Lipótváros | 27.342 | 2,59 | 10.534\n |\n| **VI** | Terézváros | 43.377 | 2,38 | 18.226\n |\n| **VII** | Erzsébetváros | 64.767 | 2,09 | **30.989** |\n| **VIII** | Józsefváros | 85.173 | 6,85 | 11.890\n |\n| **IX** | Ferencváros | 63.697 | 12,53 | 4.859\n |\n| **X** | Kőbánya | 81.475 | 32,5 | 2.414\n |\n| **XI** | Újbuda | **145.510** | 33,47 | 4.313\n |\n| **XII** | Hegyvidék | 55.776 | 26,67 | 2.109\n |\n| **XIII** | Angyalföld,Göncz Árpád városközpont,Újlipótváros, Vizafogó | 118.320 | 13,44 | 8.804\n |\n| **XIV** | Zugló | 123.786 | 18,15 | 6.820\n |\n| **XV** | Rákospalota, Pestújhely, Újpalota | 79.779 | 26,95 | 2.988\n |\n| **XVI** | Árpádföld, Cinkota, Mátyásföld,Sashalom, Rákosszentmihály | 68.235 | 33,52 | 2.037\n |\n| **XVII** | Rákosmente | 78.537 | **54.83** | 1.418\n |\n| **XVIII** | Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre | 94.663 | 38,61 | 2.414\n |\n| **XIX** | Kispest | 62.210 | 9,38 | 6.551\n |\n| **XX** | Pesterzsébet | 63.887 | 12,18 | 5.198\n |\n| **XXI** | Csepel | 76.976 | 25,75 | 2.963\n |\n| **XXII** | Budafok-Tétény | 51.071 | 34,25 | 1.473\n |\n| **XXIII** | Soroksár | 19.982 | 40,78 | 501\n |\n| ![](image) **City of Budapest**\n | **1,740,041** | **525.2** | **3,313.1** |\n| Hungary\n | 9,937,628 | 93,030 | 107.2\n |\n| *Source: Eurostat,[122] HSCO[7]* |\n\n\nMost of today's Budapest is the result of a late-nineteenth-century renovation, but the wide boulevards laid out then only bordered and bisected much older quarters of activity created by centuries of Budapest's evolution as a city. Budapest's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names. These are either informal designations, reflecting the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units of former boroughs.[123] Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without official boundaries.[124] Originally Budapest had 10 districts after coming into existence upon the unification of the three cities in 1873. Since 1950, Greater Budapest has been divided into 22 boroughs (and 23 since 1994). At that time there were changes both in the order of districts and in their sizes. The city now consists of 23 districts, 6 in Buda, 16 in Pest and 1 on Csepel Island between them. The city centre itself, in its broadest sense, comprises Districts **V, VI, VII, VIII, IX**[125] and **XIII** on the Pest side, and **I, II, XI** and **XII** on the Buda side of the city.[126]\n\n\nDistrict I is a small area in central Buda, including the historic Buda Castle. District II is also in Buda, in the northwest, and District III stretches along the northernmost part of Buda. To reach District IV, one must cross the Danube to Pest (the eastern side), where it occupies the northernmost point. With District V, another circle begins, located right in the absolute centre of Pest. Districts VI, VII, VIII and IX are the neighbouring areas to the east, going southwards, one after the other. District X is another, more external circle, also in Pest, while one must jump to the Buda side again to find Districts XI and XII, going northwards. No other districts in this circle remain in Buda. We must retrace our steps to Pest again to find Districts XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, XVIII, XIX and XX (mostly external parts of the city ), lying almost regularly in a semicircle, going southwards again. District XXI is the extension of the above circle between two branches of the Danube, the northern tip of a long island south of Budapest. District XXII is still on the same circle in southwest Buda, and finally District XXIII is again in southernmost Pest, irregular only because it was part of District XX until 1994.[127]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Budapest\n\n![](image)Budapest population pyramid in 2022\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Budapest compared to Hungary and EU**\n |\n|  | **Budapest** | **Hungary** | **European Union** |\n| **Total Population** | 1,763,913 | 9,937,628 | 507,890,191\n |\n| **Population change, 2004 to 2014** | +2.7%[128] | −1.6%[128] | +2.2%[129] |\n| **Population density** | 3,314 /km2 | 107 /km2 | 116 /km2 |\n| **GDP per capita PPP** | $52,770[130] | $33,408[131] | $33,084[132] |\n| **Bachelor's Degree or higher** | 34.1%[133] | 19.0%[133] | 27.1%[134] |\n| **Foreign born** | 7.3%[135] | 1.7%[136] | 6.3%[137] |\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1784  | 57,100 | —     |\n| 1850  | 206,339 | +261.4% |\n| 1870  | 302,086 | +46.4% |\n| 1880  | 402,706 | +33.3% |\n| 1890  | 560,079 | +39.1% |\n| 1900  | 861,434 | +53.8% |\n| 1910  | 1,110,453 | +28.9% |\n| 1920  | 1,232,026 | +10.9% |\n| 1930  | 1,442,869 | +17.1% |\n| 1941  | 1,712,791 | +18.7% |\n| 1949  | 1,590,316 | −7.2% |\n| 1955  | 1,713,552 | +7.7% |\n| 1960  | 1,804,606 | +5.3% |\n| 1965  | 1,877,916 | +4.1% |\n| 1970  | 1,945,083 | +3.6% |\n| 1980  | 2,059,226 | +5.9% |\n| 1990  | 2,005,028 | −2.6% |\n| 2001  | 1,773,401 | −11.6% |\n| 2011  | 1,729,040 | −2.5% |\n| 2022  | 1,682,426 | −2.7% |\n| 1784,[138] Population 2001 to 2019[128]Present-territory of BudapestPopulation size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions. |\n\n\nBudapest is the most populous city in Hungary and one of the largest cities in the European Union, with a growing number of inhabitants, estimated at 1,763,913 in 2019,[139] whereby inward migration exceeds outward migration.[14] These trends are also seen throughout the Budapest metropolitan area, which is home to 3.3 million people.[140][141] This amounts to about 34% of Hungary's population. In 2014, the city had a population density of 3,314 people per square kilometre (8,580/sq mi), rendering it the most densely populated of all municipalities in Hungary. The population density of Elisabethtown-District VII is 30,989/km2 (80,260/sq mi), which has the highest population density figure in Hungary and one of the highest in the world. For comparison, the density in Manhattan is 25,846/km2.[142]\n\n\nBudapest is the fourth most \"dynamically growing city\" by population in Europe,[143] and the Euromonitor predicts a population increase of almost 10% between 2005 and 2030.[144] The European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion says Budapest's population will increase by 10% to 30% only due to migration by 2050.[145] A constant inflow of migrants in recent years has fuelled population growth in Budapest. Productivity gains and the relatively large economically active share of the population explain why household incomes have increased in Budapest to a greater extent than in other parts of Hungary. Higher incomes in Budapest are reflected in the lower share of expenditure the city's inhabitants allocate to necessary spending such as on food and non-alcoholic drinks.[140]\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 microcensus, there were 1,764,263 people living in Budapest in 907,944 dwellings.[146] Some 1.6 million persons from the metropolitan area may be within Budapest's boundaries during working hours, and during special events. This fluctuation in the population is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work, education, health care, and special events.[147]\n\n\nBy ethnicity there were 1,697,039 (96.2%) Hungarians, 34,909 (2%) Germans, 16,592 (0.9%) Romani, 9,117 (0.5%) Romanians and 5,488 (0.3%) Slovaks.[148] In Hungary people can declare multiple ethnic identities, hence the sum may exceed 100%.[149] The share of ethnic Hungarians in Budapest (96.2%) is slightly lower than the national average (98.3%) due to the international migration.[149]\n\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 1,712,153 people (99.0%) speak Hungarian, of whom 1,692,815 people (97.9%) speak it as a first language, while 19,338 people (1.1%) speak it as a second language. Other spoken (foreign) languages were: English (536,855 speakers, 31.0%), German (266,249 speakers, 15.4%), French (56,208 speakers, 3.3%) and Russian (54,613 speakers, 3.2%).[135]\n\n\nAccording to the same census, 1,600,585 people (92.6%) were born in Hungary, 126,036 people (7.3%) outside Hungary while the birthplace of 2,419 people (0.1%) was unknown.[135]\nAlthough only 1.7% of the population of Hungary in 2009 were foreigners, 43% of them lived in Budapest, making them 4.4% of the city's population (up from 2% in 2001).[136] Nearly two-thirds of foreigners living in Hungary were under 40 years old. The primary motivation for this age group living in Hungary was employment.[136]\n\n\nBudapest is home to one of the most populous Christian communities in Central Europe, numbering 698,521 people (40.4%) in 2011.[135] According to the 2011 census, there were 501,117 (29.0%) Roman Catholics, 146,756 (8.5%) Calvinists, 30,293 (1.8%) Lutherans, 16,192 (0.9%) Greek Catholics, 7,925 (0.5%) Jews and 3,710 (0.2%) Orthodox in Budapest. 395,964 people (22.9%) were irreligious while 585,475 people (33.9%) did not declare their religion.[135] The city is also home to one of the largest Jewish communities in Europe.[150]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of companies based in Budapest and Economy of Hungary\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The city had a gross metropolitan product of more than $100 billion in 2015, making it one of the largest regional economies in the European Union.[152]\nAccording to Eurostat GDP, per capita in purchasing power parity is 147% of the EU average in Budapest, which means €37,632 ($42,770) per capita.[130]\nBudapest is also among the Top 100 GDP performing cities in the world, measured by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The city was named as the 52nd most important business centre in the world in the Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index, ahead of Beijing, São Paulo and Shenzhen and ranking 3rd (out of 65 cities) on the MasterCard Emerging Markets Index.[153][154] The city is 48th on the UBS *The most expensive and richest cities in the world* list, standing before cities such as Prague, Shanghai, Kuala Lumpur and Buenos Aires.[155]\nIn a global city competitiveness ranking by the EIU, Budapest stands before Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Moscow and Johannesburg among others.[156]\n\n\nThe city is a major centre for banking and finance, real estate, retailing, trade, transportation, tourism, new media as well as traditional media, advertising, legal services, accountancy, insurance, fashion and the arts in Hungary and regionally. Budapest is home not only to almost all national institutions and government agencies, but also to many domestic and international companies. In 2014 there were 395.804 companies registered in the city.[157] Most of these entities are headquartered in Budapest's Central Business District, in the District V and District XIII. The retail market of the city (and the country) is also concentrated in the downtown area, among others, in the two largest shopping centres in Central and Eastern Europe, the 186,000 sqm WestEnd City Center and the 180,000 sqm Arena Plaza.[158][159]\n\n\nBudapest has notable innovation capabilities as a technology and start-up hub. Many start-ups are headquartered and begin their business in the city. Some of the best known examples are Prezi, LogMeIn and NNG. Budapest is the highest ranked Central and Eastern European city in the Innovation Cities' Top 100 index.[160] A good indicator of the city's potential for innovation and research, is that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology chose Budapest for its headquarters, along with the UN, whose Regional Representation for Central Europe office is in the city, responsible for UN operations in seven countries.[161] Moreover, the global aspect of the city's research activity is shown through the establishment of the European Chinese Research Institute in the city.[162] Other important sectors also include, natural science research, information technology and medical research, non-profit institutions, and universities. The leading business schools and universities in Budapest, the Budapest Business School, the CEU Business School and Corvinus University of Budapest offer a whole range of courses in economics, finance and management in English, French, German and Hungarian.[163] The unemployment rate in Budapest is by far the lowest within Hungary. It was 2.7%, with many thousands of employed foreign citizens.[164]\n\n\nBudapest is among the 25 most visited cities in the world, welcoming more than 4.4 million international visitors each year,[165] therefore the traditional and the congress tourism industry also deserve a mention, as they contribute greatly to the city's economy. The capital is home to many convention centres and there are thousands of restaurants, bars, coffee houses and party places, besides a full range of hotels. As regards restaurants, examples can be found of the highest quality Michelin-starred restaurants, such as Onyx, Costes, Tanti and Borkonyha. The city ranked as the most liveable city in Central and Eastern Europe on EIU's quality of life index in 2010.\n\n\n\n### Finance and corporate location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nHungarian Stock Exchange Palace on Liberty Square\n\nThe Budapest Stock Exchange, a key institution of publicly offered securities in Hungary and Central and Eastern Europe, is situated in Budapest's CBD at Liberty Square. BSE also trades other securities such as government bonds and derivatives as well as stock options. Large Hungarian multinational corporations headquartered in Budapest are listed on the BSE, for instance the Fortune Global 500 firms MOL Group, the OTP Bank, FHB Bank, Gedeon Richter, Magyar Telekom, CIG Pannonia, Zwack Unicum and more.[166] Nowadays nearly all branches of industry can be found in Budapest. Although there is no particularly special industry in the city's economy, the financial centre role of the city is strong, with nearly 40 major banks being represented in the city including[167] as well as those like Bank of China, KDB Bank and Hanwha Bank, which are unique in the region.\n\n\n\n![](image)MOL Campus, a neomodern skyscraper and the headquarters of MOL Group\nMany international banks and financial service providers also support the financial industry of Budapest, firms such as Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, GE Capital, Deutsche Bank, Sberbank, ING Group, Allianz, KBC Group, UniCredit and MSCI among others. Another particularly strong industry in the capital city is the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. There are also traditionally strong domestic companies in Budapest such as Egis, Gedeon Richter, Chinoin as well as international biotechnology corporations such as Pfizer, Teva, Novartis, Sanofi, which also have R&D and production divisions here. Further high-tech industries, involved in software development and engineering are notable as well. Nokia, Ericsson, Bosch, Microsoft and IBM employ thousands of engineers in research and development in the city. Game design is also strongly represented with headquarters of domestic companies Digital Reality, Black Hole and the studios of Crytek and Gameloft. Apart from the above, there are regional headquarters of global firms such as Alcoa, General Motors, General Electric, ExxonMobil, BP, BT, Flextronics, Panasonic, Huawei, Knorr-Bremse, Liberty Global, Tata Consultancy, Aegon, WizzAir, TriGránit, MVM Group and Graphisoft. There is a base for major international companies including, but not limited to, Nissan CEE, Volvo, Saab and Ford.\n\n\n\n## Politics and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Hungary\n\n![](image)Model United Nations conference in the assembly hall of House of Magnates\n![](image)Old building (from 1890) of the Hungarian Royal Curia, that operated as the highest court in the Kingdom of Hungary between 1723 and 1949. Now it houses a museum.\n![](image)U.S. President George W. Bush meets with Hungarian President László Sólyom at Sándor Palace in Budapest.\n![](image)Sándor Palace, the official residence and workspace of the president of Hungary\nAs the capital of Hungary, Budapest is the seat of the country's national government. The President of Hungary resides at the Sándor Palace in the District I (Buda Castle District),[168] while the office of the Hungarian Prime Minister is in the Carmelite Monastery in the Castle District.[169] Government ministries are all located in various parts of the city, most of them are in the District V, Leopoldtown. The National Assembly is seated in the Hungarian Parliament, which also located in the District V.[170] The President of the National Assembly, the third-highest public official in Hungary, is also seated in the largest building in the country, in the Hungarian Parliament.\n\n\nHungary's highest courts are located in Budapest. The Curia (supreme court of Hungary), the highest court in the judicial order, which reviews criminal and civil cases, is located in the District V, Leopoldtown. Under the authority of its president it has three departments: criminal, civil and administrative-labour law departments. Each department has various chambers. The Curia guarantees the uniform application of law. The decisions of the Curia on uniform jurisdiction are binding for other courts.[171] The second most important judicial authority, the National Judicial Council, is also housed in the District V, with the tasks of controlling the financial management of the judicial administration and the courts and giving an opinion on the practice of the president of the National Office for the Judiciary and the Curia deciding about the applications of judges and court leaders, among others.[172]\nThe Constitutional Court of Hungary is one of the highest level actors independent of the politics in the country. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for the protection of the Constitution, its tasks being the review of the constitutionality of statutes. The Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part of the ordinary judicial system. The constitutional court passes on the constitutionality of laws, and there is no right of appeal on these decisions.[173]\n\n\nBudapest hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organizations as well, including United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, European Institute of Innovation and Technology, European Police Academy, International Centre for Democratic Transition, Institute of International Education, International Labour Organization, International Organization for Migration, International Red Cross, Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, Danube Commission and even others.[174] The city is also home to more than 100 embassies and representative bodies as an international political actor.\n\n\nEnvironmental issues have a high priority among Budapest's politics. Institutions such as the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe, located in Budapest, are very important assets.[175] To decrease the use of cars and greenhouse gas emissions, the city has worked to improve public transportation, and nowadays the city has one of the highest mass transit usage in Europe. Budapest has one of the best public transport systems in Europe with an efficient network of buses, trolleys, trams and subway. Budapest has an above-average proportion of people commuting on public transport or walking and cycling for European cities.[176] Riding on bike paths is one of the best ways to see Budapest – there are about 180 kilometres (110 miles) of bicycle paths in the city, fitting into the EuroVelo system.[177]\n\n\nCrime in Budapest is investigated by different bodies. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes in their 2011 Global Study on Homicide that, according to criminal justice sources, the homicide rate in Hungary, calculated based on UN population estimates, was 1.4 in 2009, compared to Canada's rate of 1.8 that same year.[178]\nThe homicide rate in Budapest is below the EU capital cities' average according to WHO also.[179] However, organised crime is associated with the city, the Institute of Defence in a UN study named Budapest as one of the \"global epicentres\" of illegal pornography, money laundering and contraband tobacco, and also a negotiation center for international crime group leaders.[180]\n\n\n\n### City governance[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mayor of Budapest, Lord Mayor of Budapest, and General Assembly of Budapest\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Composition of the 33 seats in the General Assembly**\n |\n|  | **Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union** | 13 seats\n |\n|  | **Hungarian Socialist Party** | 5 seats\n |\n|  | **Momentum** | 3 seats\n |\n|  | **Democratic Coalition** | 7 seats\n |\n|  | **Dialogue for Hungary** | Mayor + 1 seat\n |\n|  | **Independent** | 3 seats\n |\n\n\n![](image)Central City Hall\nBudapest has been a metropolitan municipality with a mayor-council form of government since its consolidation in 1873, but Budapest also holds a special status as a county-level government, and also special within that, as holds a capital-city territory status.[181] In Budapest, the central government is responsible for the urban planning, statutory planning, public transport, housing, waste management, municipal taxes, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, among others. The Mayor is responsible for all city services, police and fire protection, enforcement of all city and state laws within the city, and administration of public property and most public agencies. Besides, each of Budapest' twenty-three districts has its own town hall and a directly elected council and the directly elected mayor of district.[2]\n\n\nThe Mayor of Budapest is Gergely Karácsony who was elected on 13 October 2019. The mayor and members of General Assembly are elected to five-year terms.[2]\nThe Budapest General Assembly is a unicameral body consisting of 33 members, which consist of the 23 mayors of the districts, 9 from the electoral lists of political parties, plus Mayor of Budapest (the Mayor is elected directly). Each term for the mayor and assembly members lasts five years.[182] Submitting the budget of Budapest is the responsibility of the Mayor and the deputy-mayor in charge of finance. The latest, 2014 budget was approved with 18 supporting votes from ruling Fidesz and 14 votes against by the opposition lawmakers.[183]\n\n\n\n## Main sights and tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of sights and historic places in Budapest and List of tourist attractions in Budapest\n\nBudapest is widely known for its well-kept pre-war cityscape, with a great variety of streets and landmarks in classical architecture.\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the capital is the neo-Gothic Parliament, the biggest building in Hungary with its 268 metres (879 ft) length, also holding (since 2001) the Hungarian Crown Jewels.\n\n\nSaint Stephen's Basilica is the most important religious building of the city, where the Holy Right Hand of Hungary's first king, Saint Stephen is on display as well.\n\n\nThe Hungarian cuisine and café culture can be seen and tasted in a lot of places, like Gerbeaud Café, the *Százéves*, *Biarritz*, *Fortuna*, *Alabárdos*, *Arany Szarvas*, *Kárpátia* and the world-famous Mátyás-pince [hu] restaurants and beer bars.\n\n\nThere are Roman remains at the Aquincum Museum, and historic furniture at the Nagytétény Castle Museum, just 2 out of 223 museums in Budapest. Another historical museum is the House of Terror, hosted in the building that was the venue of the Nazi Headquarters. The Castle Hill, the River Danube embankments and the whole of Andrássy út have been officially recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n\nCastle Hill and the Castle District; there are three churches here, six museums, and a host of interesting buildings, streets and squares. The former Royal Palace is one of the symbols of Hungary – and has been the scene of battles and wars ever since the 13th century. Nowadays it houses two museums and the National Széchenyi Library. The nearby Sándor Palace contains the offices and official residence of the President of Hungary. The seven-hundred-year-old Matthias Church is one of the jewels of Budapest, it is in neo-Gothic style, decorated with coloured shingles and elegant pinnacles. Next to it is an equestrian statue of the first king of Hungary, King Saint Stephen, and behind that is the Fisherman's Bastion, built in 1905 by the architect Frigyes Schulek, the Fishermen's Bastions owes its name to the namesake corporation that during the Middle Ages was responsible of the defence of this part of ramparts, from where opens out a panoramic view of the whole city. Statues of the Turul, the mythical guardian bird of Hungary, can be found in both the Castle District and the Twelfth District.\n\n\nIn Pest, arguably the most important sight is Andrássy út. This Avenue is an elegant 2.5 kilometres (2 miles) long tree-lined street that covers the distance from Deák Ferenc tér to the Heroes Square. This Avenue overlooks many important sites. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. As far as Kodály körönd and Oktogon both sides are lined with large shops and flats built close together. Between there and Heroes' Square the houses are detached and altogether grander. Under the whole runs continental Europe's oldest Underground railway, most of whose stations retain their original appearance. Heroes' Square is dominated by the Millenary Monument, with the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front. To the sides are the Museum of Fine Arts and the Kunsthalle Budapest, and behind City Park opens out, with Vajdahunyad Castle. One of the jewels of Andrássy út is the Hungarian State Opera House. Statue Park, a theme park with striking statues of the Communist era, is located just outside the main city and is accessible by public transport.\n\n\nThe Dohány Street Synagogue is the largest synagogue in Europe, and the second largest active synagogue in the world.[184] The synagogue is located in the Jewish district taking up several blocks in central Budapest bordered by Király utca, Wesselényi utca, Grand Boulevard and Bajcsy Zsilinszky road. It was built in moorish revival style in 1859 and has a seating capacity of 3,000. Adjacent to it is a sculpture reproducing a weeping willow tree in steel to commemorate the Hungarian victims of the Holocaust.\n\n\nThe city is also home to the largest medicinal bath in Europe (Széchenyi Medicinal Bath) and the third largest Parliament building in the world, once the largest in the world. Other attractions are the bridges of the capital. Seven bridges provide crossings over the Danube, and from north to south are: the Árpád Bridge (built in 1950 at the north of Margaret Island); the Margaret Bridge (built in 1901, destroyed during the war by an explosion and then rebuilt in 1948); the Chain Bridge (built in 1849, destroyed during World War II and then rebuilt in 1949); the Elisabeth Bridge (completed in 1903 and dedicated to the murdered Queen Elisabeth, it was destroyed by the Germans during the war and replaced with a new bridge in 1964); the Liberty Bridge (opened in 1896 and rebuilt in 1989 in Art Nouveau style); the Petőfi Bridge (completed in 1937, destroyed during the war and rebuilt in 1952); the Rákóczi Bridge (completed in 1995). Most remarkable for their beauty are the Margaret Bridge, the Chain Bridge and the Liberty Bridge. The world's largest panorama photograph was created in (and of) Budapest in 2010.[185]\n\n\nTourists visiting Budapest can receive free maps and information from the nonprofit Budapest Festival and Tourism Center at its info-points.[186] The info centers also offer the Budapest Card which allows free public transit and discounts for several museums, restaurants and other places of interest. Cards are available for 24-, 48- or 72-hour durations.[187] The city is also well known for its ruin bars both day and night.[188]\n\n\n\n* ![Well-preserved Baroque University Church](image)\n\nWell-preserved Baroque University Church\n* ![Boscolo Budapest Hotel, café in the ground floor, a 107-room hotel above](image)\n\nBoscolo Budapest Hotel, café in the ground floor, a 107-room hotel above\n* ![Interior of Gerbeaud Café](image)\n\nInterior of Gerbeaud Café\n* ![Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles, and Chief Rabbi Róbert Frölich in the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe](image)\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles, and Chief Rabbi Róbert Frölich in the Dohány Street Synagogue, the largest synagogue in Europe\n\n\n### Squares[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Holy Trinity column in the Holy Trinity Square, Buda Castle Hill\nIn Budapest there are many smaller and larger squares, the most significant of which are Heroes' Square, Kossuth Square, Liberty Square, St. Stephen's Square, Ferenc Deák Square, Vörösmarty Square, Erzsébet Square, St. George's Square and Széchenyi István Square. The Heroes' Square at the end of Andrássy Avenue is the largest and most influential square in the capital, with the Millennium Monument in the center, and the Museum of Fine Arts and The Hall of Art. Kossuth Square is a symbolic place of the Hungarian statehood, the Hungarian Parliament Building, the Palace of Justice and the Ministry of Agriculture. The Liberty Square is located in the Belváros-Lipótváros District (Inner City District), as one of Budapest's most beautiful squares. There are buildings such as the Hungarian National Bank, the embassy of the United States, the Stock Exchange Palace, as well as numerous statues and monuments such as the Soviet War Memorial, the Statue of Ronald Reagan or the controversial Monument to the victims of the German occupation. In the St. Stephen's Square is the St. Stephen's Basilica, the square is connected by a walking street, the Zrínyi Street, to the Széchenyi István Square at the foot of The Chain Bridge. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Gresham Palace and the Ministry of Interior are also located here. Deák Ferenc Square is a central square of the capital, a major transport hub, where three Budapest subways meet. Here is the oldest and best known Evangelical Church of Budapest, the Deák Ferenc Square Lutheran Church. Vörösmarty Square is located in Belváros-Lipótváros District (Inner City District) behind the Vigadó of Pest as one of the endpoints of Váci Street. The Confectionery Gerbeaud is here, and the annual Christmas Fair is held in the Square, as well as is the centre of the Holiday Book Week.\n\n\n\n### Parks and gardens[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Parks in Budapest\n\n![](image)The City Park Ice Rink, located in the City Park; the Vajdahunyad Castle is in the background.\nBudapest has many municipal parks and most have playgrounds for children and seasonal activities like skating in the winter and boating in the summer. Access from the city center is quick and easy with the Millennium Underground. Budapest has a complex park system, with various lands operated by the Budapest City Gardening Ltd.[189]\nThe wealth of greenspace afforded by Budapest's parks is further augmented by a network of open spaces containing forest, streams, and lakes that are set aside as natural areas which lie not far from the inner city, including the Budapest Zoo and Botanical Garden (established in 1866) in the City Park.[190]\nThe most notable and popular parks in Budapest are the City Park which was established in 1751 (302 acres) along with Andrássy Avenue,[191] the Margaret Island in the Danube (238 acres or 96 hectares),[192] the People's Park, the Római Part, and the Kopaszi Dam.[193]\n\n\nThe Buda Hills also offer a variety of outdoor activities and views. A place frequented by locals is Normafa, offering activities for all seasons. With a modest ski run, it is also used by skiers and snow boarders – if there is enough snowfall in winter.\n\n\n\n### Islands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Park on Margaret Island\n![](image)Aerial panorama with Margaret Island\nA number of islands can be found on the Danube in Budapest:\n\n\n\n* Margaret Island (Hungarian: *Margit-sziget* [ˈmɒrɡit.siɡɛt]) is a 2.5 km (1.6 mi) long island and 0.965 square kilometres (238 acres) in area. The island mostly consists of a park and is a popular recreational area for tourists and locals alike. The island lies between Margaret Bridge (south) and Árpád Bridge (north). Dance clubs, swimming pools, an aqua park, athletic and fitness centres, bicycle and running tracks can be found around the Island. During the day the island is occupied by people doing sports, or just resting. In the summer (generally on the weekends) mostly young people go to the island at night to party on its terraces, or to recreate with a bottle of alcohol on a bench or on the grass (this form of entertainment is sometimes referred to as bench-partying).\n* Csepel Island (Hungarian: *Csepel-sziget* [ˈt͡ʃɛpɛlsiɡɛt]) is the largest island of the River Danube in Hungary. It is 48 km (30 mi) long; its width is 6 to 8 km (4 to 5 mi) and its area comprises 257 km2 (99 sq mi). However, only the northern tip of the island is inside the city limits.\n* Hajógyári Island (Hungarian: *Hajógyári-sziget* [ˈhɒjoːɟaːrisiɡɛt]), also known as Óbuda Island (Hungarian: *Óbudai-sziget*), is a human-made island located in the third district. This island hosts many activities such as: wake-boarding, jet-skiing during the day, and dance clubs during the night. This is the island where the famous Sziget Festival takes place, hosting hundreds of performances per year. Around 400,000 visitors attended the last festival. Many building projects are taking place to make this island into one of the biggest entertainment centres of Europe. The plan is to build apartment buildings, hotels, casinos and a marina.\n* Molnár Island [hu] (Hungarian: *Molnár-sziget*) is an island in the channel of the Danube that separates Csepel Island from the east bank of the river.\n\n\nThe islands of Palotai Island [hu], Nép Island [hu], and Háros Island [hu] also formerly existed within the city, but have been joined to the mainland.\n\n\nThe Ínség Rock [hu] (Hungarian: *Ínség-szikla*) is a reef in the Danube close to the shore under the Gellért Hill. It is only exposed during drought periods when the river level is very low.\n\n\nJust outside the city boundary to the north lies the large Szentendre Island (Hungarian: *Szentendrei-sziget*) and the much smaller Lupa Island (Hungarian: *Lupa-sziget*).\n\n\n\n### Spas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Széchenyi Thermal Bath in the City Park\nOne of the reasons the Romans first colonised the area immediately to the west of the River Danube and established their regional capital at Aquincum (now part of Óbuda, in northern Budapest) is so that they could use and enjoy the thermal springs. There are still ruins visible today of the enormous baths that were built during that period. The new baths that were constructed during the Turkish period (1541–1686) served both bathing and medicinal purposes, and some of these are still in use to this day.[194][195]\n\n\nBudapest gained its reputation as a city of spas in the 1920s, following the first realisation of the economic potential of the thermal waters in drawing in visitors. Indeed, in 1934 Budapest was officially ranked as a \"City of Spas\". Today, the baths are mostly frequented by the older generation, as, with the exception of the \"Magic Bath\" and \"Cinetrip\" water discos, young people tend to prefer the lidos which are open in the summer.\n\n\nConstruction of the Király Baths started in 1565, and most of the present-day building dates from the Turkish period, including most notably the fine cupola-topped pool.\n\n\nThe Rudas Baths are centrally placed – in the narrow strip of land between Gellért Hill and the River Danube – and also an outstanding example of architecture dating from the Turkish period. The central feature is an octagonal pool over which light shines from a 10 metres (33 ft) diameter cupola, supported by eight pillars.\n\n\n\n![](image)Gate of the Gellért Spa\nThe Gellért Baths and Hotel were built in 1918, although there had once been Turkish baths on the site, and in the Middle Ages a hospital. In 1927, the Baths were extended to include the wave pool, and the effervescent bath was added in 1934. The well-preserved Art Nouveau interior includes colourful mosaics, marble columns, stained glass windows and statues.\n\n\nThe Lukács Baths are also in Buda and are also Turkish in origin, although they were only revived at the end of the 19th century. This was also when the spa and treatment centre were founded. There is still something of an atmosphere of fin-de-siècle about the place, and all around the inner courtyard there are marble tablets recalling the thanks of patrons who were cured there. Since the 1950s it has been regarded as a centre for intellectuals and artists.\n\n\nThe Széchenyi Baths are one of the largest bathing complexes in all Europe, and the only \"old\" medicinal baths to be found in the Pest side of the city. The indoor medicinal baths date from 1913 and the outdoor pools from 1927. There is an atmosphere of grandeur about the whole place with the bright, largest pools resembling aspects associated with Roman baths, the smaller bath tubs reminding one of the bathing culture of the Greeks, and the saunas and diving pools borrowed from traditions emanating in northern Europe. The three outdoor pools (one of which is a fun pool) are open all year, including winter. Indoors there are over ten separate pools, and a whole host of medical treatments is also available. The Szécheny Baths are built in modern Renaissance style.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNight panorama of the Gellért Hill with the illuminated Buda Castle, Matthias Church, Danube Chain Bridge, Parliament, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, St. Stephen's Basilica, Budapest Eye, and Vigadó Concert Hall\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Budapest with Gellért Hill, Liberty Statue, Budapest Eye, Buda Castle, Matthias Church, Parliament, St. Stephen's Basilica\n\n## Infrastructure and transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport\n\n![](image)Budapest International Airport arrivals and departures lounge between terminal 2A and 2B, named SkyCourt\nBudapest is served by Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport (BUD) (named after Franz Liszt, the notable Hungarian composer), one of the busiest airports in Central and Eastern Europe, located 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) east-southeast of the centre of Budapest, in the District XVIII. The airport offers international connections among all major European cities, and also to North America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East.\nAs Hungary's busiest airport, it handles nearly all of the country's air passenger traffic. Budapest Liszt Ferenc handled around 250 scheduled flights daily in 2013, and an ever-rising number of charters. London, Brussels, Frankfurt, Munich, Paris, and Amsterdam are the busiest international connections respectively, while Toronto, Montreal, Dubai, Doha and Alicante are the most unusual in the region.[196]\nToday the airport serves as a base for Ryanair, Wizz Air, Budapest Aircraft Service, CityLine Hungary, Farnair Hungary and Travel Service Hungary among others. The airport is accessible via public transportation from the city centre by the Metro line 3 and then the airport bus No. 200E.[197]\n\n\nAs part of a strategic development plan, €561 million have been spent on expanding and modernising the airport infrastructure until December 2012. Most of these improvements are already completed,[198] the postponed ones are the new cargo area and new piers for terminal 2A and 2B, but these development are on standby also, and will start immediately, when the airport traffic will reach the appropriate level.\nSkyCourt, the newest, state-of-the-art building between the 2A and 2B terminals with 5 levels. Passenger safety checks were moved here along with new baggage classifiers and the new Malév and SkyTeam business lounges, as well as the first MasterCard lounge in Europe.[199]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Budapest metro and rapid transit network within the city and to suburbs\n![](image)Green Line 4, a driverless metro line with real-time PIDS system at Kálvin square, a transfer station to Blue Line 3\n![](image)CAF Tram on Line 17 at Széll Kálmán Square\nPublic transit in Budapest is provided by the Centre for Budapest Transport (BKK, *Budapesti Közlekedési Központ*), one of the largest transportation authorities in Europe.[200] BKK operates 4 metro lines (including the historic Line 1, the oldest underground railway in continental Europe), 5 suburban railway lines, 33 tram lines, 15 trolleybus lines, 264 bus lines (including 40 night routes), 4 boat services, and *BuBi*, a smart bicycle sharing network. On an average weekday, BKK lines transports 3.9 million riders; in 2011, it handled a total of 1.4 billion passengers.[201] In 2014, the 65% of the passenger traffic in Budapest was by public transport and 35% by car. The aim is 80%–20% by 2030 in accordance with the strategy of BKK.[202]\n\n\nCitizens of the European Union, the European Economic Area and Switzerland who are at least 65 years old can use the public transport for free.[203]\n\n\nThe development of complex intelligent transportation system in the city is advancing; the application of smart traffic lights is widespread, they are GPS and computer controlled and give priority to the GPS connected public transport vehicles automatically, as well as the traffic is measured and analyzed on the roads and car drivers informed about the expected travel time and traffic by intelligent displays (EasyWay project).[204] Public transport users are immediately notified of any changes in public transport online, on smartphones and on PIDS displays, as well car drivers can keep track of changes in traffic and road management in real-time online and on smartphones through the *BKK Info*.[205][206] As well all vehicles can be followed online and on smartphones in real-time throughout the city with the *Futár* PIDS system,[207] while the continuous introducing of integrated e-ticket system will help the measurement of passenger numbers on each line and the intelligent control of service frequency.\n\n\nThe development of *Futár*, the citywide real-time passenger information system and real-time route planner is finished already and now all of the public transport vehicle is connected via satellite system. The real-time information of trams, buses and trolleybuses are available for both the operators in the control room and for all the passengers in all stops on smartphone and on city street displays.[208] The implementation of latest generation automated fare collection and e-ticket system with NFC compatibility and reusable contactless smart cards for making electronic payments in online and offline systems in Budapest is started in 2014, the project is implemented and operated by the operator of Hong Kong Octopus card jointly with one of the leading European companies of e-ticket and automated fare collection, Scheidt & Bachmann.[209] The deployment of 300 new digital contactless ticket vending machine will be finished by the end of 2014 in harmonization with the e-ticket system.[210]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Volvo 7900A Hybrid in Budapest on Line 5 operated by BKK\nTram lines no. 4 and 6 are the busiest city tram lines in the world,[211] with one of the world's longest trams (54-metre long Siemens Combino) running at 2–3-minute intervals at peak time and 4–5 minutes off-peak. Day services are usually from 4 am until between 11 pm and 0:30 am.[176] Hungarian State Railways operates an extensive network of commuter rail services, their importance in the suburban commuter passenger traffic is significant, but in travel within the city is limited.\nThe organiser of public transport in Budapest is the municipal corporation *Centre for Budapest Transport* (Budapesti Közlekedési Központ – BKK), that is responsible for planning and organising network and services, planning and developing tariff concepts, attending to public service procurer duties, managing public service contracts, operating controlling and monitoring systems, setting and monitoring service level agreements related to public transport, attending to customer service duties, selling and monitoring tickets and passes, attending to integrated passenger information duties, unified Budapest-centric traffic control within public transport, attending to duties related to river navigation, plus the management of Budapest roads, operating taxi stations, unified control of bicycle traffic development in the capital, preparing parking strategy and developing an operational concept, preparation of road traffic management, developing an optimal traffic management system, organising and co-ordinating road reconstruction and more, in short, everything which is related to transport in the city.[212]\n\n\n\n### Roads and railways[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hungarian State Railways and Motorways in Hungary\n\n![](image)Western railway station\n![](image)Megyeri Bridge on M0 highway ring road around Budapest\n![](image)Keleti Railway Station (Budapest East Central)\nBudapest is the most important Hungarian road terminus, all of the major highways and railways end within the city limits. The road system in the city is designed in a similar manner to that of Paris, with several ring roads, and avenues radiating out from the center. Ring road M0 around Budapest is nearly completed, with only one section missing on the west side due to local disputes. The ring road is 80 kilometres (50 miles) in length, and once finished it will be 107 kilometres (66 mi) of highway in length.\n\n\nThe city is a vital traffic hub because all major European roads and European railway lines lead to Budapest.[91] The Danube was and is still today an important water-way and this region in the centre of the Carpathian Basin lies at the cross-roads of trade routes.[94]\nHungarian main line railways are operated by Hungarian State Railways. There are three main railway station in Budapest, Keleti (*Eastern*), Nyugati (*Western*) and Déli (*Southern*), operating both domestic and international rail services. Budapest is one of the main stops of the on its Central and Eastern European route.[213] There is also a suburban rail service in and around Budapest, three lines of which are operated under the name HÉV.\n\n\n\n### Ports, shipping and others[edit]\n\n\nThe river Danube flows through Budapest on its way from (Germany) to the Black Sea. The river is easily navigable and so Budapest historically has a major commercial port at Csepel District and at New Pest District also. The Pest side is also a famous port place with international shipping ports for cargo[214] and for passenger ships.[215] In the summer months, a scheduled hydrofoil service operates on the Danube connecting the city to Vienna.\n\n\nBKK (through the operator BKV) also provides public transport with boat service within the borders of the city. Two routes, marked D11 and D12, connect the two banks with Margaret Island and Óbuda Island, from Rómaifürdő (Buda side, north to Óbuda Island) or Árpád Bridge (Pest side) to Rákóczi Bridge, with a total of 18 stops, while route D2 circulates in the downtown.[216] Line D14 is a ferry service, connecting Királyerdő on the Csepel Island with Molnár Island on the Pest side, south to the city centre.[216] In addition, several companies provides sightseeing boat trips and also an amphibious vehicle (bus and boat) operates constantly.\n\n\nWater quality in Budapest harbours improved dramatically in the recent years, treatment facilities processed 100% of generated sewage in 2010. Budapesters regularly kayak, canoe, jet-ski and sail on the Danube, which has continuously become a major recreational site for the city.\n\n\nSpecial vehicles in Budapest, besides metros, include suburban rails, trams and boats. There are a couple of less common vehicles in Budapest, like the trolleybus on several lines in Pest, the Castle Hill Funicular between the Chain Bridge and Buda Castle, the cyclecar for rent in Margaret Island, the chairlift, the Budapest Cog-wheel Railway and children's railway. The latter three vehicles run among Buda hills.\n\n\n\n## Culture and contemporary life[edit]\n\n\nMain pages: Category:Culture in Budapest and Culture of Hungary\n\n![](image)Hungarian Academy of Sciences seat in Budapest, founded in 1825 by Count István Széchenyi\nThe culture of Budapest is reflected by Budapest's size and variety.

Modern Hungarian cuisine is a synthesis of ancient Asiatic components mixed with French, Germanic, Italian, and Slavic elements. The food of Hungary can be considered a melting pot of the continent, with a culinary base formed from its own, original Magyar cuisine. Considerable numbers of Saxons, Armenians, Italians, Jews and Serbs settled in the Hungarian basin and in Transylvania, also contributing with different new dishes. Elements of ancient Turkish cuisine were adopted during the Ottoman era, in the form of sweets (for example different nougats, like white nougat called *törökméz*), quince (*birsalma*), Turkish delight, Turkish coffee or rice dishes like pilaf, meat and vegetable dishes like the eggplant, used in eggplant salads and appetizers, stuffed peppers and stuffed cabbage called *töltött káposzta*. Hungarian cuisine was influenced by Austrian cuisine under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed from Austrian cuisine, and vice versa.[227]\n\n\nBudapest restaurants reflect diversity, with menus carrying traditional regional cuisine, fusions of various culinary influences, or innovating in the leading edge of new techniques. Budapest' food shops also have a solid reputation for supplying quality specialised culinary products and supplies, reputations that are often built up over generations. These include many shops, such as Café Gerbeaud, one of the greatest and most traditional coffeehouses in Europe, or the Gundel restaurant and gastro shop in the City Park.\nFoodies can also find the highest quality foods served in several Michelin-starred restaurants, like Onyx, Costes, Borkonyha or Tanti.\n\n\n\n### In fiction[edit]\n\n\nThe 1906 novel *The Paul Street Boys*, the 1937 novel *Journey by Moonlight*, the 1957 book *The Bridge at Andau*, the 1975 novel *Fateless*, the 1977 novel *The End of a Family Story*, the 1986 book *Between the Woods and the Water*, the 1992 novel *Under the Frog*, the 1987 novel *The Door*, the 2002 novel *Prague*, the 2003 book *Budapeste*, the 2004 novel *Ballad of the Whisky Robber*, the 2005 novels *Parallel Stories* and *The Historian*, the 2012 novel *Budapest Noir* are set, amongst others, partly or entirely in Budapest.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000.

This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000.

This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest Australian city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory[12] at the northern tip of the Australian Alps, the country's highest mountain range. As of June 2022,[update] Canberra's estimated population was 456,692.[2]\n\n\nThe area chosen for the capital had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for up to 21,000 years,[13] with the principal group being the Ngunnawal people. European settlement commenced in the first half of the 19th century, as evidenced by surviving landmarks such as St John's Anglican Church and Blundells Cottage. On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital,[14] a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least 100 mi (160 km) from Sydney. The capital city was founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913. A blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected after an international design contest, and construction commenced in 1913.[15] Unusual among Australian cities, it is an entirely planned city. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks such as Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie, Capital Hill and City Hill. Canberra's mountainous location makes it the only mainland Australian city where snow-capped mountains can be seen in winter; although snow in the city itself is uncommon.\n\n\nAs the seat of the Government of Australia, Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. This includes Parliament House, Government House, the High Court and the headquarters of numerous government agencies. It is the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance such as the Australian War Memorial, the Australian National University, the Royal Australian Mint, the Australian Institute of Sport, the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library. The city is home to many important institutions of the Australian Defence Force including the Royal Military College Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy. It hosts all foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations.\n\n\nCanberra has been ranked among the world's best cities to live in and visit.[16][17][18][19][20] Although the Commonwealth Government remains the largest single employer in Canberra, it is no longer the majority employer. Other major industries have developed in the city, including in health care, professional services, education and training, retail, accommodation and food, and construction.[21] Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. At the 2016 Census, 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were reported as having been born overseas.[22]\n\n\nCanberra's design is influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. Its design can be viewed from its highest point at the Telstra Tower and the summit of Mount Ainslie. Other notable features include the National Arboretum, born out of the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and Lake Burley Griffin, named for the city's architects. Highlights in the annual calendar of cultural events include Floriade, the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere,[23][24] the Enlighten Festival, Skyfire, the National Multicultural Festival and Summernats. Canberra's main sporting venues are Canberra Stadium and Manuka Oval. The city is served with domestic and international flights at Canberra Airport, while interstate train and coach services depart from Canberra railway station and the Jolimont Centre respectively. City Interchange is the main hub of Canberra's bus and light rail transport network.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe word \"Canberra\" is derived from the name of a local Ngunnawal clan who resided in the area and were referred to by the early British colonists as either the *Canberry* or *Nganbra* tribe. Joshua John Moore, the first European land-owner in the region, named his grant \"Canberry\" in 1823 after these people. \"Canberry Creek\" and \"Canberry\" first appeared on regional maps from 1830, while the derivative name \"Canberra\" started to appear from around 1857.[25][26][27]\n\n\nNumerous local commentators, including the Ngunnawal elder Don Bell, have speculated upon possible meanings of \"Canberra\" over the years. These include \"meeting place\", \"woman's breasts\" and \"the hollow between a woman's breasts\".[28][29]\n\n\nAlternative proposals for the name of the city during its planning included Austral, Australville, Aurora, Captain Cook, Caucus City, Cookaburra, Dampier, Eden, Eucalypta, Flinders, Gonebroke, Home, Hopetoun, Kangaremu, Myola, Meladneyperbane, New Era, Olympus, Paradise, Shakespeare, Sydmelperadbrisho, Swindleville, The National City, Union City, Unison, Wattleton, Wheatwoolgold, Yass-Canberra.[30][31][32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canberra\n\nSee also: History of the Australian Capital Territory\n\n### First Nations peoples[edit]\n\n\nThe first peoples of the Canberra area are the Ngunnawal people, while the Ngarigo lived immediately to the south of the ACT (including some of the far-southern suburbs of Canberra), the Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south, Gandangara people to the north and Wiradjuri to the north-west.\n\n\nThe first British settlers into the Canberra area described two clans of Ngunnawal people resident to the vicinity. The *Canberry* or *Nganbra* clan lived mostly around Sullivan's Creek and had ceremonial grounds at the base of Galambary (Black Mountain), while the *Pialligo* clan had land around what is now Canberra Airport.[33][34] The people living here carefully managed and cultivated the land with fire and farmed yams and hunted for food.[35]\n\n\nArchaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites as well as stone tools and arrangements.[36] Artefacts suggests early human activity occurred at some point in the area 21,000 years previously.[13]\n\n\nStill today, Ngunnawal men into the present conduct ceremony on the banks of the river, Murrumbidgee River. They travel upstream as they receive their Totems and corresponding responsibilities for land management. 'Murrum' means 'Pathway' and Bidgee means 'Boss'.[35]\n\n\nThe submerged limestone caves beneath Lake Burley Griffin contained Aboriginal rock art, some of the only sites in the region.[35]\n\n\nGalambary (Black Mountain) is an important Aboriginal meeting and business site, predominantly for men’s business. According to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, Mt Ainslie is primarily for place of women’s business. Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie are referred to as women’s breasts. Galambary was also used by Ngunnawal people as an initiation site, with the mountain itself said to represent the growth of a boy into a man.[35]\n\n\n\n### British exploration and colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St John's Anglican Church, the oldest surviving public building in the inner city, consecrated in 1845\n![](image)Blundells Cottage, built around 1860,[37] is one of the few remaining buildings built by the first white settlers of Canberra. In October 1820, Charles Throsby led the first British expedition to the area.[38][39][40][41] Four other expeditions occurred between 1820 and 1823 with the first accurate map being produced by explorer Mark John Currie in June 1823. By this stage the area had become known as the Limestone Plains.[38][42]\n\n\nBritish settlement of the area probably dates from late 1823, when a sheep station was formed on what is now the Acton Peninsula by James Cowan, the head stockman employed by Joshua John Moore.[43] Moore had received a land grant in the region in 1823 and formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826. He named the property \"Canberry\". On 30 April 1827, Moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of 1,000 acres (405 ha) at Canberry.[44]\n\n\nOther colonists soon followed Moore's example to take up land in the region. Around 1825 James Ainslie, working on behalf of the wealthy merchant Robert Campbell, arrived to establish a sheep station. He was guided to the region by a local Aboriginal girl who showed him the fine lands of her *Pialligo* clan.[33] The area then became the property of Campbell and it was initially named Pialligo before Campbell changed it to the Scottish title of Duntroon.[25][45][46] Campbell's family later built the imposing stone house that is now the officers' mess of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.[47] The Campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of \"Weetangera\".[48]\n\n\nOther notable early colonists included Henry Donnison, who established the Yarralumla estate—now the site of the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia—in 1827, and John Palmer who employed Duncan Macfarlane to form the Jerrabomberra property in 1828. A year later, John MacPherson established the Springbank estate, becoming the first British owner-occupier in the region.[25][49][50]\n\n\nThe Anglican church of St John the Baptist, in the suburb of Reid,[51] was consecrated in 1845 and is now the oldest surviving public building in the city.[52][53] St John's churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district.[54] It has been described as a \"sanctuary in the city\",[55][56] remaining a small English village-style church even as the capital grew around it. Canberra's first school, St John's School (now a museum), was situated next to the church and opened in the same year of 1845.[57] It was built to educate local settlers children,[58] including the Blundell children who lived in nearby Blundell's Cottage.[59]\n\n\nAs the European presence increased, the Indigenous population dwindled largely due to the destruction of their society, dislocation from their lands and from introduced diseases such as influenza, smallpox, alcoholism and measles.[60][61]\n\n\n\n### Creation of the nation's capital[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The opening of Parliament House in May 1927\nThe district's change from a rural area in New South Wales to the national capital started during debates over federation in the late 19th century.[62][63] Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital,[14] a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least 100 mi (160 km) from Sydney,[62] with Melbourne to be the temporary seat of government while the new capital was built.[64] A survey was conducted across several sites in New South Wales with Bombala, southern Monaro, Orange, Yass, Albury, Tamworth, Armidale, Tumut and Dalgety all discussed.[65] Dalgety was chosen by the federal parliament and it passed the *Seat of Government Act 1904* confirming Dalgety as the site of the nation's capital. However, the New South Wales government refused to cede the required territory as they did not accept the site.[65] In 1906, the New South Wales Government finally agreed to cede sufficient land provided that it was in the Yass-Canberra region as this site was closer to Sydney.[62] Newspaper proprietor John Gale circulated a pamphlet titled 'Dalgety or Canberra: Which?' advocating Canberra to every member of the Commonwealth's seven state and federal parliaments. By many accounts, it was decisive in the selection of Canberra as the site in 1908 as was a result of survey work done by the government surveyor Charles Scrivener.[66] The NSW government ceded the district to the federal government in 1911 and the Federal Capital Territory was established.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Griffin's plan for Canberra\nAn international design competition was launched by the Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institution of Civil Engineers and their affiliated bodies throughout the British Empire because the Minister for Home Affairs King O'Malley insisted that the final decision was for him to make rather than an expert in city planning.[67] A total of 137 valid entries were received. O'Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him but they could not reach unanimity. On 24 May 1911,[68] O'Malley came down on the side of the majority of the board with the design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin of Chicago, Illinois, United States, being declared the winner.[69][70] Second was Eliel Saarinen of Finland and third was Alfred Agache of Brazil but resident in Paris, France.[67] O'Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. On 25 November 1912, the board advised that it could not support Griffin's plan in its entirety and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising. This plan incorporated the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O'Malley on 10 January 1913.[67] In 1913, Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began.[71] On 23 February, King O'Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.\n\n\nIn 1912, the government invited suggestions from the public as to the name of the future city. Almost 750 names were suggested. At midday on 12 March 1913,[72][73] Lady Denman, the wife of Governor-General Lord Denman, announced that the city would be named \"Canberra\" at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill,[74][75][76] which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present Parliament House.[77] Canberra Day is a public holiday observed in the ACT on the second Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra.[61] After the ceremony, bureaucratic disputes hindered Griffin's work;[78] a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials and his original plan was reinstated.[79] Griffin's relationship with the Australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in 1920, little work had been done.[80][81] By this time, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of major avenues and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.[82][83]\n\n\n\n### Development throughout 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Canberra's Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia\n![](image)Two of Canberra's best-known landmarks, Parliament House (foreground) and Old Parliament House (background) are aligned with each other\nThe Commonwealth government purchased the pastoral property of Yarralumla in 1913 to provide an official residence for the Governor-General of Australia in the new capital.[84] Renovations began in 1925 to enlarge and modernise the property.[85] In 1927, the property was official dubbed Government House.[84] On 9 May that year, the Commonwealth parliament moved to Canberra with the opening of the Provisional Parliament House.[86][87] The Prime Minister Stanley Bruce had officially taken up residence in The Lodge a few days earlier.[88][89] Planned development of the city slowed significantly during the depression of the 1930s and during World War II.[90] Some projects planned for that time, including Roman Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, were never completed.[91] (Nevertheless, in 1973 the Roman Catholic parish church of St. Christopher was remodelled into St. Christopher's Cathedral, Manuka, serving the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is the only cathedral in Canberra.[92])\n\n\nFrom 1920 to 1957, three bodies — successively the Federal Capital Advisory Committee,[93] the Federal Capital Commission,[94] and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee — continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra in the absence of Griffin. However, they were only advisory and development decisions were made without consulting them, which increased inefficiency.[82][95]\n\n\nThe largest event in Canberra up to World War II was the 24th Meeting of ANZAAS in January 1939. *The Canberra Times* described it as \"a signal event ... in the history of this, the world's youngest capital city\". The city's accommodation was not nearly sufficient to house the 1,250 delegates and a tent city had to be set up on the banks of the Molonglo River. One of the prominent speakers was H. G. Wells, who was a guest of the Governor-General Lord Gowrie for a week. This event coincided with a heatwave across south-eastern Australia during which the temperature in Canberra reached 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 Celsius) on 11 January. On Friday, 13 January, the Black Friday bushfires caused 71 deaths in Victoria and Wells accompanied the Governor-General on his tour of areas threatened by fires.[96]\n\n\nImmediately after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly.[97][98][99] Canberra was often derisively described as \"several suburbs in search of a city\".[100] Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment.[101] Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city for poor performance. Menzies remained in office for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly.[102][103] The population grew by more than 50 per cent in every five-year period from 1955 to 1975.[103] Several Government departments, together with public servants, were moved to Canberra from Melbourne following the war.[104] Government housing projects were undertaken to accommodate the city's growing population.[105]\n\n\nThe National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) formed in 1957 with executive powers and ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin — the centrepiece of Griffin's design — and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work.[106] The completion of the lake finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin's Parliamentary Triangle.[107] Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Various civic landmarks line Lake Burley Griffin. Pictured is the National Library and Parliament House (background)\nThe newly built Australian National University was expanded and sculptures as well as monuments were built.[108][109] A new National Library was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle, followed by the High Court and the National Gallery.[51][110] Suburbs in Canberra Central (often referred to as North Canberra and South Canberra) were further developed in the 1950s and urban development in the districts of Woden Valley and Belconnen commenced in the mid and late 1960s respectively.[111][112] Many of the new suburbs were named after Australian politicians such as Barton, Deakin, Reid, Braddon, Curtin, Chifley and Parkes.[113]\n\n\nOn 9 May 1988, a larger and permanent Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations.[114][110] The Commonwealth Parliament moved there from the Provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.[114]\n\n\n\n### Self-government[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1988, the Australian Capital Territory was granted full self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament, a step proposed as early as 1965.[115] Following the first election on 4 March 1989,[116] a 17-member Legislative Assembly sat at temporary offices at 1 Constitution Avenue, Civic, on 11 May 1989.[117][118] Permanent premises were opened on London Circuit in 1994.[118] The Australian Labor Party formed the ACT's first government, led by the Chief Minister Rosemary Follett, who made history as Australia's first female head of government.[119][120]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Skywhale and Skywhalepapa in 2021\nParts of Canberra were engulfed by bushfires on 18 January 2003 that killed four people, injured 435 and destroyed more than 500 homes as well as the major research telescopes of Australian National University's Mount Stromlo Observatory.[121]\n\n\nThroughout 2013, several events celebrated the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra.[122] On 11 March 2014, the last day of the centennial year, the Canberra Centenary Column was unveiled in City Hill. Other works included *The Skywhale*, a hot air balloon designed by the sculptor Patricia Piccinini,[123] and *StellrScope* by visual media artist Eleanor Gates-Stuart.[124] On 7 February 2021, *The Skywhale* was joined by *Skywhalepapa* to create a *Skywhale family*, an event marked by Skywhale-themed pastries and beer produced by local companies as well as an art pop song entitled \"We are the Skywhales\".[125]\n\n\nIn 2014, Canberra was named the best city to live in the world by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,[16] and was named the third best city to visit in the world by Lonely Planet in 2017.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Canberra region seen from space\nCanberra covers an area of 814.2 km2 (314.4 sq mi)[4] and is located near the Brindabella Ranges (part of the Australian Alps), approximately 150 km (93 mi) inland from Australia's east coast. It has an elevation of approximately 580 m (1,900 ft) AHD;[126] the highest point is Mount Majura at 888 m (2,913 ft).[127][128] Other low mountains include Mount Taylor 855 m (2,805 ft),[129] Mount Ainslie 843 m (2,766 ft),[130] Mount Mugga Mugga 812 m (2,664 ft)[131] and Black Mountain 812 m (2,664 ft).[132][133]\n\n\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly eucalypt species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including *Pinus radiata* on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)The location of Canberra within the ACT. Canberra's main districts are shown in yellow: Canberra Central (marked as North Canberra and South Canberra), Woden Valley, Belconnen, Weston Creek, Tuggeranong, and Gungahlin.\nThe urban environs of the city of Canberra straddle the Ginninderra plain, Molonglo plain, the Limestone plain, and the Tuggeranong plain (Isabella's Plain).[135] The Molonglo River which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capital's iconic feature Lake Burley Griffin.[136] The Molonglo then flows into the Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.[135]\n\n\nA number of creeks, including Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, flow into the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee.[135] Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes Ginninderra and Tuggeranong.[137][138][139] Until recently the Molonglo River had a history of sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Autumn foliage in Canberra\nUnder the Köppen-Geiger classification, Canberra has an oceanic climate (*Cfb*).[142] In January, the warmest month, the average high is approximately 29 °C (84 °F); in July, the coldest month, the average high drops to approximately 12 °C (54 °F).\n\n\nFrost is common in the winter months. Snow is rare in the CBD (central business district) due to being on the leeward (eastern) side of the dividing range, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped Brindabella Range can be seen from the CBD. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968.[126] Canberra is often affected by foehn winds, especially in winter and spring, evident by its anomalously warm maxima relative to altitude.\n\n\n\nThe highest recorded maximum temperature was 44.0 °C (111.2 °F) on 4 January 2020.[143] Winter 2011 was Canberra's warmest winter on record, approximately 2 °C (4 °F) above the average temperature.[144] \n\n![](image)Long-term temperature increase in Canberra\nThe lowest recorded minimum temperature was −10.0 °C (14.0 °F) on the morning of 11 July 1971.[126] Light snow falls only once in every few years, and is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates.[126]\n\n\nCanberra is protected from the west by the Brindabellas which create a strong rain shadow in Canberra's valleys.[126] Canberra gets 100.4 clear days annually.[145] Annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart)[146] and is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall.[147] Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April,[126] owing to the effect of summer and the mountains. The area is generally sheltered from a westerly wind, though strong northwesterlies can develop. A cool, vigorous afternoon easterly change, colloquially referred to as a 'sea-breeze' or the 'Braidwood Butcher',[148][149] is common during the summer months[150] and often exceeds 40 km/h in the city. Canberra is also less humid than the nearby coastal areas.[126]\n\n\nCanberra was severely affected by smoke haze during the 2019/2020 bushfires. On 1 January 2020, Canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world, with an AQI of 7700 (USAQI 949).[151]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Canberra Airport Comparison (1991–2010 averages, extremes to 1939); 578 m AMSL; 35.30° S, 149.20° E\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 44.0(111.2)\n | 42.7(108.9)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 41.6(106.9)\n | 44.0(111.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 14.0(57.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 0.3(32.5)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 4.0(39.2)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 2.8(37.0)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | −3.7(25.3)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −10.0(14.0)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −3.4(25.9)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | 0.3(32.5)\n | −10.0(14.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 61.3(2.41)\n | 55.2(2.17)\n | 37.6(1.48)\n | 27.3(1.07)\n | 31.5(1.24)\n | 50.0(1.97)\n | 44.3(1.74)\n | 43.1(1.70)\n | 55.8(2.20)\n | 50.9(2.00)\n | 68.4(2.69)\n | 54.1(2.13)\n | 579.5(22.81)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 6.8\n | 6.7\n | 5.7\n | 5.4\n | 6.3\n | 9.7\n | 10.0\n | 8.5\n | 9.8\n | 9.1\n | 10.2\n | 7.2\n | 95.4\n |\n| Average afternoon relative humidity (%)\n | 37\n | 40\n | 42\n | 46\n | 54\n | 60\n | 58\n | 52\n | 49\n | 47\n | 41\n | 37\n | 47\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 294.5\n | 254.3\n | 251.1\n | 219.0\n | 186.0\n | 156.0\n | 179.8\n | 217.0\n | 231.0\n | 266.6\n | 267.0\n | 291.4\n | 2,813.7\n |\n| Source 1: Climate averages for Canberra Airport Comparison (1939–2010); averages given are for 1991–2010[145][152] |\n| Source 2: Records from Canberra Airport for more recent extremes[153] |\n\n### Urban structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Suburbs of Canberra\n\n![](image)Inner Canberra demonstrates some aspects of the Griffin plan, in particular the Parliamentary Triangle.\n![](image)An aerial view of the Civic Centre from Mount Ainslie\nCanberra is a planned city and the inner-city area was originally designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect.[154] Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid.[155] Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii.[155] However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.[156]\n\n\nLake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra.[157][158] The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from Capital Hill—the eventual location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial.[98] This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak,[158] the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately 52 km (32 mi) south west of Canberra.[133]\n\n\nThe straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards Black Mountain.[158] A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis.[159] The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which links City Hill in Civic Centre and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the Parliamentary Triangle, and formed the centrepiece of Griffin's work.[158][159]\n\n\n\n![](image)Black Mountain with the landmark Telstra Tower on the right and the National Arboretum in the foreground\nThe Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value.[160] This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.[80][81][161]\n\n\nThe urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven residential districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities.[162] The districts were settled in the following chronological order:\n\n\n\n* Canberra Central, mostly settled in the 1920s and 1930s, with expansion up to the 1960s,[163] 25 suburbs\n* Woden Valley, first settled in 1964,[112] 12 suburbs\n* Belconnen, first settled in 1966,[112] 27 suburbs (2 not yet developed)\n* Weston Creek, settled in 1969, 8 suburbs[164]\n* Tuggeranong, settled in 1974,[165] 18 suburbs\n* Gungahlin, settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs (3 not yet developed)\n* Molonglo Valley, development began in 2010, 13 suburbs planned.\n\n\nThe Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.[158][159][166] In 1967 the then National Capital Development Commission adopted the \"Y Plan\" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,[167] with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.[167]\n\n\nDevelopment in Canberra has been closely regulated by government,[168][169] both through planning processes and the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.[170] There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised,[169] but also voices in support of planning consistent with the original 'bush capital' and 'urban forest' ideals that underpin Canberra's design.[171]\n\n\nMany of Canberra's suburbs are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.[172] Street names typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of Page are named after biologists and naturalists.[172] Most diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of Yarralumla, Deakin and O'Malley.[173] There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of Fyshwick, Mitchell and Hume.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Canberra and Lake Burley Griffin set against the backdrop of distant New South Wales, taken from the Telstra Tower\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n |\n| Points of Interest Looking South from Mount Ainslie\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1\n | War Memorial |\n| 2\n | Anzac Parade |\n| 3\n | Old Parliament House |\n| 4\n | New Parliament House |\n| 5\n | National Gallery |\n| 6\n | High Court |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 7\n | Questacon |\n| 8\n | National Library |\n| 9\n | Edmund Barton Building |\n| 10\n | Brindabella Ranges |\n| 11\n | Lovett Tower |\n| 12\n | Ben Chifley Building |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 13\n | Lake Burley Griffin |\n| 14\n | Limestone Avenue |\n| 15\n | Fairbairn Avenue |\n| 16\n | Parkes Way |\n| 17\n | R G Casey Building |\n| 18\n | John Gorton Building |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 19\n | King Edward Terrace |\n| 20\n | Presbyterian Church of Saint Andrew |\n| 21\n | St John's Anglican Church |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Sustainability and the environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floriade is held in Commonwealth Park every spring. It is the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere, employing and encouraging environmental practises, including the use of green energy.[175]\nThe average Canberran was responsible for 13.7 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2005.[176] In 2012, the ACT Government legislated greenhouse gas targets to reduce its emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, 80 per cent by 2050, with no net emissions by 2060.[177] The government announced in 2013 a target for 90% of electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources by 2020,[178] and in 2016 set an ambitious target of 100% by 2020.[179][180]\n\n\nIn 1996 Canberra became the first city in the world to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion.[181] The strategy aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community.[182] By early 2010, it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.[183][184]\n\n\nPlastic bags made of polyethylene polymer with a thickness of less than 35 µm were banned from retail distribution in the ACT from November 2011.[185][186][187] The ban was introduced by the ACT Government in an effort to make Canberra more sustainable.[186]\n\n\nOf all waste produced in the ACT, 75 per cent is recycled.[188] Average household food waste in the ACT remains above the Australian average, costing an average $641 per household per annum.[189]\n\n\nCanberra's annual Floriade festival features a large display of flowers every Spring in Commonwealth Park. The organisers of the event have a strong environmental standpoint, promoting and using green energy, \"green catering\", sustainable paper, the conservation and saving of water.[175] The event is also smoke-free.[175]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Territory government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories\n\n![](image)ACT Legislative Assembly  \nand the statue *Ethos* (Tom Bass, 1961)\nThere is no local council or city government for the city of Canberra. The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly performs the roles of both a city council for the city and a territory government for the rest of the Australian Capital Territory.[190] However, the vast majority of the population of the Territory reside in Canberra and the city is therefore the primary focus of the ACT Government.\n\n\nThe assembly consists of 25 members elected from five districts using proportional representation. The five districts are Brindabella, Ginninderra, Kurrajong, Murrumbidgee and Yerrabi, which each elect five members.[191] The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet.[190]\n\n\nWhereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor,[192][193] the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly and were in government during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001. Labor took back control of the Assembly in 2001.[119] At the 2004 election, Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and the Labor Party won 9 of the 17 seats allowing them to form the ACT's first majority government.[119] Since 2008, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens.[119][194][195] As of 2022[update], the Chief Minister was Andrew Barr from the Australian Labor Party.\n\n\nThe Australian federal government retains some influence over the ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through the actions of the National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin's plan for the city,[196] such as the Parliamentary Triangle, Lake Burley Griffin, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park).[196][197][198] The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the *Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988*.[199] This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly.[200]\n\n\n\n### Federal representation[edit]\n\n\nThe ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949 when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory.[201][202] However, the ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory.[202] In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats and the House of Representatives seat was divided into two.[201] A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.[192] At the 2019 election, the third seat has been reintroduced as the Division of Bean.\n\n\nThe House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor and usually by comfortable margins.[192][193] The Labor Party has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990 and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points.[119] The ALP and the Liberal Party held one Senate seat each until the 2022 election when Independent candidate David Pocock unseated the Liberal candidate Zed Seselja.[203]\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and policing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory, Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and ACT Policing\n\nSee also: Crime in the Australian Capital Territory\n\n![](image)High Court of Australia\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces, under a contractual agreement with the ACT Government.[204] The AFP does so through its community policing arm ACT Policing.[205]\n\n\nPeople who have been charged with offences are tried either in the ACT Magistrates Court or, for more severe offences, the ACT Supreme Court.[206] Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually imprisoned in New South Wales.[207] The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130 million.[208] The ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal deal with minor civil law actions and other various legal matters.[209][210]\n\n\nCanberra has the lowest rate of crime of any capital city in Australia as of 2019[update].[211] As of 2016[update] the most common crimes in the ACT were property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft. They affected 2,304 and 966 people (580 and 243 per 100,000 persons respectively). Homicide and related offences—murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, but excluding driving causing death and conspiracy to murder—affect 1.0 per 100,000 persons, which is below the national average of 1.9 per 100,000. Rates of sexual assault (64.4 per 100,000 persons) are also below the national average (98.5 per 100,000).[212][213][214] However the 2017 crime statistics showed a rise in some types of personal crime, notably burglaries, thefts and assaults.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Just under a third of Canberrans are employed in the public sector, working in government departments such as the ACT Government\nIn February 2020, the unemployment rate in Canberra was 2.9% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%.[215] As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city.[216] The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is $1827 compared with the national average of $1658 (November 2019).[217]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Civic is home to various administrative departments, such as the Department of Education, Skills and Employment\nThe median house price in Canberra as of February 2020 was $745,000, lower than only Sydney among capital cities of more than 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005.[217][218][219] The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories.[220] As of January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most expensive in the country.[221] Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply,[222] and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bunda Street in Canberra's shopping district; tourism, retail and hospitality are also major employers.\nThe city's main industry is public administration and safety, which accounted for 27.1% of Gross Territory Product in 2018-19 and employed 32.49% of Canberra's workforce.[224][21] The headquarters of many Australian Public Service agencies are located in Canberra, and Canberra is also host to several Australian Defence Force establishments, most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and HMAS *Harman*, which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri-service, multi-user depot.[225] Other major sectors by employment include Health Care (10.54%), Professional Services (9.77%), Education and Training (9.64%), Retail (7.27%), Accommodation & Food (6.39%) and Construction (5.80%).\n\n\n\n[21]\n\n![](image)A growing number of Canberrans work in the science and technology sector, such as at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.\nThe former RAAF Fairbairn, adjacent to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport,[226] but the base continues to be used for RAAF VIP flights.[227][228] A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to capitalise on the concentration of government customers; these include Tower Software and RuleBurst.[229][230] A consortium of private and government investors is making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region.[231] A Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node was established in 2019 to grow the ACT's cyber security sector and related space, defence and education industries.[232]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Canberra\n\n![](image)High-density residential apartments; Canberra has one of the fastest growing populations in the nation[233]\nAt the 2021 census, the population of Canberra was 453,558,[233] up from 395,790 at the 2016 census,[234] and 355,596 at the 2011 census.[235] Canberra has been the fastest-growing city in Australia in recent years, having grown 23.3% from 2011-2021.[233]\n\n\nCanberrans are relatively young, highly mobile and well educated. The median age is 35 years and only 12.7% of the population is aged over 65 years.[234] Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved to or from Canberra, which was the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city.[236] As at May 2017, 43% of ACT residents (25–64) had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a bachelor's degree, significantly higher that the national average of 31%.[237]\n\n\nAccording to statistics collected by the National Australia Bank and reported in *The Canberra Times*, Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories, for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income.[238]\n\n\n\n### Ancestry and immigration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The annual Canberra Nara Candle Festival\n\n\nCountry of birth (2016)[22]\n| Birthplace[N 1] | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | 269,682\n |\n| England | 12,739\n |\n| Mainland China | 11,334\n |\n| India | 10,405\n |\n| New Zealand | 4,722\n |\n| Philippines | 3,789\n |\n| Vietnam | 3,340\n |\n| United States | 2,775\n |\n| Sri Lanka | 2,774\n |\n| Malaysia | 2,431\n |\n| South Korea | 2,283\n |\n\n\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:[N 2][22]\n\n\n\n* English (35%)\n* Australian (34%)[N 3]\n* Irish (14%)\n* Scottish (11%)\n* Chinese (6%)\n* German (4.7%)\n* Indian (3.9%)\n* Italian (3.5%)\n* Dutch (1.7%)\n* Indigenous (1.6%)[N 4]\n* Filipino (1.3%)\n* Vietnamese (1.3%)\n* Greek (1.3%)\n* Croatian (1.2%)\n* Polish (1.1%)\n\nThe 2016 census showed that 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were born overseas.[22] Of inhabitants born outside Australia, the most prevalent countries of birth were England, China, India, New Zealand and the Philippines.[240]\n\n\n1.6% of the population, or 6,476 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.[N 5][22]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2016 census, 72.7% of people spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Mandarin (3.1%), Vietnamese (1.1%), Cantonese (1%), Hindi (0.9%) and Spanish (0.8%).[22]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nOn census night in 2016, approximately 50.0% of ACT residents described themselves as Christian (excluding not stated responses), the most common denominations being Catholic and Anglican; 36.2% described themselves as having no religion.[234]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in the Australian Capital Territory\n\n![](image)ANU School of Art (formerly the Canberra High School)\nThe two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively.[241][242] Established in 1946,[243] the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by *The Times Higher Education Supplement* and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings.[242][244] There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University;[245] St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.[246] The ACT Government announced on 5 March 2020 that the CIT campus and an adjoining carpark in Reid would be leased to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) for a peppercorn lease, for it to develop as a campus for a new UNSW Canberra.[247] UNSW released a master plan in 2021 for a 6,000 student campus to be realised over 15 years at a cost of $1 billion.[248]\n\n\nThe Australian Defence College has two campuses: the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC) plus the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies (CDSS) at Weston, and the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) beside the Royal Military College, Duntroon located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell.[249][250] ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales;[251][252] Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training.[253]\n\n\nTertiary level vocational education is also available through the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT), with campuses in Bruce, Reid, Gungahlin, Tuggeranong and Fyshwick.[254] The combined enrolment of the CIT campuses was over 28,000 students in 2019.[255] Following the transfer of land in Reid for the new UNSW Canberra, a new CIT Woden is scheduled to be completed by 2025.[256]\n\n\nIn 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private.[257] During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its *Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools* policy.[258] As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools was to proceed over a decade. The closure of schools provoked significant opposition.[259][260][261] Most suburbs were planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these were usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities were easily available.[262] Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments.[263]\n\n\n\n### Arts and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Music of Canberra\n\n![](image)National Film and Sound Archive\nCanberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Library,[166] the National Archives,[264] the Australian Academy of Science,[265] the National Film & Sound Archive and the National Museum.[166] Many Commonwealth government buildings in Canberra are open to the public, including Parliament House, the High Court and the Royal Australian Mint.[266][267][268]\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Australia established in 2001 records Australia's social history and is one of Canberra's more architecturally daring buildings.\nLake Burley Griffin is the site of the Captain James Cook Memorial and the National Carillon.[166] Other sites of interest include the Australian–American Memorial, Commonwealth Park, Commonwealth Place, the Telstra Tower, the Australian National Botanic Gardens, the National Zoo and Aquarium, the National Dinosaur Museum, and Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre.[166][269]\n\n![](image)The Australian War Memorial\nThe Canberra Museum and Gallery in the city is a repository of local history and art, housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions.[270] Several historic homes are open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the Tuggeranong Valley,[271][272] Mugga-Mugga in Symonston,[273] and Blundells' Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers.[37] Calthorpes' House in Red Hill is a well-preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days.[274] Strathnairn Homestead is an historic building which also dates from the 1920s.\n\n\nCanberra has many venues for live music and theatre: the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions;[275] and Llewellyn Hall (within the ANU School of Music), a world-class concert hall are two of the most notable.[276] The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings.[276] The Albert Hall was the city's first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society.[277]\n\n\n\n![](image)The annual Skyfire fireworks display over Lake Burley Griffin, held during the Enlighten Festival\nStonefest was a large annual festival, for some years one of the biggest festivals in Canberra.[278][279] It was downsized and rebranded as Stone Day in 2012.[280] There are numerous bars and nightclubs which also offer live entertainment, particularly concentrated in the areas of Dickson, Kingston and the city.[281] Most town centres have facilities for a community theatre and a cinema, and they all have a library.[282] Popular cultural events include the National Folk Festival, the Royal Canberra Show, the Summernats car festival, Enlighten festival, the National Multicultural Festival in February and the *Celebrate Canberra* festival held over 10 days in March in conjunction with Canberra Day.[283]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Toku* in the Canberra-Nara Peace Park, which is located in the Lennox Gardens\nCanberra maintains sister-city relationships with both Nara, Japan and Beijing, China. Canberra has friendship-city relationships with both Dili, East Timor and Hangzhou, China.[284] City-to-city relationships encourage communities and special interest groups both locally and abroad to engage in a wide range of exchange activities. The Canberra Nara Candle Festival held annually in spring, is a community celebration of the Canberra Nara Sister City relationship.[285] The festival is held in Canberra Nara Park on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin.[286]\n\n\nThe history of Canberra was told in the 1938 radio feature *Canberra the Great*.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nAs Australia's capital, Canberra is the most important centre for much of Australia's political reportage and thus all the major media, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the commercial television networks, and the metropolitan newspapers maintain local bureaus. News organisations are represented in the \"press gallery\", a group of journalists who report on the national parliament. The National Press Club of Australia in Barton has regular television broadcasts of its lunches at which a prominent guest, typically a politician or other public figure, delivers a speech followed by a question-and-answer session.[287]\n\n\nCanberra has a daily newspaper, *The Canberra Times*, which was established in 1926.[288][289] There are also several free weekly publications, including news magazines *CityNews* and *Canberra Weekly* as well as entertainment guide *BMA Magazine*. *BMA Magazine* first went to print in 1992; the inaugural edition featured coverage of the Nirvana Nevermind tour.[290]\n\n\nThere are a number of AM and FM stations broadcasting in Canberra (AM/FM Listing). The main commercial operators are the Capital Radio Network (2CA and 2CC), and Austereo/ARN (104.7 and Mix 106.3). There are also several community operated stations.  \n\nA DAB+ digital radio trial is also in operation, it simulcasts some of the AM/FM stations, and also provides several digital only stations (DAB+ Trial Listing).\n\n\nFive free-to-air television stations service Canberra:\n\n\n\n* ABC Canberra (ABC)\n* SBS New South Wales (SBS)\n* Southern Cross 10 Southern NSW & ACT (CTC) – Network 10 affiliate\n* Seven Network Southern NSW & ACT (CBN) – Seven Network owned and operated station\n* WIN Television Southern NSW & ACT (WIN) – Nine Network affiliate\n\n\nEach station broadcasts a primary channel and several multichannels. Of the three main commercial networks:\n\n\n\n* WIN airs a half-hour local *WIN News* each weeknight at 6pm, produced from a newsroom in the city and broadcast from studios in Wollongong.\n* Southern Cross 10 airs short local news updates throughout the day, produced and broadcast from its Hobart studios. It previously aired a regional edition of *Nine News* from Sydney each weeknight at 6pm, featuring opt-outs for Canberra and the ACT when it was a Nine affiliate.\n* Seven airs short local news and weather updates throughout the day, produced and broadcast from its Canberra studios.\n\n\nPrior to 1989, Canberra was serviced by just the ABC, SBS and Capital Television (CTC), which later became Ten Capital in 1994 then Southern Cross Ten in 2002 then Channel 9/Southern Cross Nine in 2016 and finally Channel 10 in 2021, with Prime Television (now Prime7) and WIN Television arriving as part of the Government's regional aggregation program in that year.[291]\n\n\nPay television services are available from Foxtel (via satellite) and telecommunications company TransACT (via cable).[292]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in the Australian Capital Territory\n\n![](image)A rugby league match at Canberra Stadium\nIn addition to local sporting leagues, Canberra has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and international competitions. The best known teams are the Canberra Raiders and the Brumbies who play rugby league and rugby union respectively; both have been champions of their leagues.[293][294] Both teams play their home games at Canberra Stadium,[295] which is the city's largest stadium and was used to hold group matches in soccer for the 2000 Summer Olympics and in rugby union for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.[296][297] The city also has a successful basketball team, the Canberra Capitals, which has won seven out of the last eleven national women's basketball titles.[298] Canberra United FC represents the city in the A-League Women (formerly the W-League), the national women's association football league, and were champions in the 2011–12 season.[299]\nThe Canberra Vikings represent the city in the National Rugby Championship and finished second in the 2015 season.\n\n\nThere are also teams that participate in national competitions in netball, field hockey, ice hockey, cricket and baseball.\n\n\nThe historic Prime Minister's XI cricket match is played at Manuka Oval annually.[300] Other significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon[301] and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\nCanberra has been bidding for an Australian Football League club since 1981 when Australian rules football in the Australian Capital Territory was more popular.[302] While the league has knocked back numerous proposals, according to the AFL Canberra belongs to the Greater Western Sydney Giants[303] who play three home games at Manuka Oval each season.\n\n\nOther significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon[301] and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is located in the Canberra suburb of Bruce.[304] The AIS is a specialised educational and training institution providing coaching for elite junior and senior athletes in a number of sports. The AIS has been operating since 1981 and has achieved significant success in producing elite athletes, both local and international.[304] The majority of Australia's team members and medallists at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney were AIS graduates.[305]\n\n\nCanberra has numerous sporting ovals, golf courses, skate parks, and swimming pools that are open to the public. Tennis courts include those at the National Sports Club, Lyneham, former home of the Canberra Women's Tennis Classic. A Canberra-wide series of bicycle paths are available to cyclists for recreational and sporting purposes. Canberra Nature Parks have a large range of walking paths, horse and mountain bike trails. Water sports like sailing, rowing, dragon boating and water skiing are held on Canberra's lakes.[306][307] The Rally of Canberra is an annual motor sport event, and from 2000 to 2002, Canberra hosted the Canberra 400 event for V8 Supercars on the temporary Canberra Street Circuit, which was located inside the Parliamentary Triangle.\n\n\nA popular form of exercise for people working near or in the Parliamentary Triangle is to do the \"bridge to bridge walk/run\" of about 5 km around Lake Burley Griffin, crossing the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge and Kings Avenue Bridge, using the paths beside the lake. The walk takes about 1 hour, making it ideal for a lunchtime excursion. This is also popular on weekends. Such was the popularity during the COVID-19 isolation in 2020 that the ACT Government initiated a 'Clockwise is COVID-wise' rule for walkers and runners.[308]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Canberra Hospital\nCanberra has two large public hospitals, the approximately 600-bed Canberra Hospital—formerly the Woden Valley Hospital—in Garran and the 174-bed Calvary Public Hospital in Bruce. Both are teaching institutions.[309][310][311][312] The largest private hospital is the Calvary John James Hospital in Deakin.[313][314] Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and Healthscope's National Capital Private Hospital in Garran are also major healthcare providers.[309][311]\n\n\nThe Royal Canberra Hospital was located on Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin; it was closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1997 in a controversial and fatal implosion to facilitate construction of the National Museum of Australia.[108][159][166][315][316] The city has 10 aged care facilities. Canberra's hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales,[317] and ACT Ambulance Service is one of four operational agencies of the ACT Emergency Services Authority.[318] NETS provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter-hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales.[319]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Glenloch Interchange connects the Tuggeranong Parkway with Parkes Way\n![](image)ACTION Volgren bodied Scania K360UA\n![](image)Alinga Street light rail station\nThe automobile is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra.[320] The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density;[321] this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.[322]\n\n\nCanberra's districts are generally connected by parkways—limited access dual carriageway roads[320][323] with speed limits generally set at a maximum of 100 km/h (62 mph).[324][325] An example is the Tuggeranong Parkway which links Canberra's CBD and Tuggeranong, and bypasses Weston Creek.[326] In most districts, discrete residential suburbs are bounded by main arterial roads with only a few residential linking in, to deter non-local traffic from cutting through areas of housing.[327]\n\n\nIn an effort to improve road safety, traffic cameras were first introduced to Canberra by the Kate Carnell Government in 1999.[328] The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red-light and speed cameras and point-to-point speed cameras; together they bring in revenue of approximately $11 million per year in fines.[328]\n\n\nACTION, the government-operated bus service, provides public transport throughout the city.[329] CDC Canberra provides bus services between Canberra and nearby areas of New South Wales of (Murrumbateman and Yass)[330] and as Qcity Transit (Queanbeyan).[331] A light rail line commenced service on 20 April 2019 linking the CBD with the northern district of Gungahlin.[332] A planned Stage 2A of Canberra's light rail network will run from Alinga Street station to Commonwealth Park, adding three new stops at City West, City South and Commonwealth Park.[333] In February 2021 ACT Minister for Transport and City Services Chris Steel said he expects construction on Stage 2A to commence in the 2021-22 financial year, and for \"tracks to be laid\" by the next Territory election in 2024.[334] At the 2016 census, 7.1% of the journeys to work involved public transport, while 4.5% walked to work.[234]\n\n\nThere are two local taxi companies. Aerial Capital Group enjoyed monopoly status until the arrival of Cabxpress in 2007.[335] In October 2015 the ACT Government passed legislation to regulate ride sharing, allowing ride share services including Uber to operate legally in Canberra.[336][337][338] The ACT Government was the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact legislation to regulate the service.[339] Since then many other ride sharing and taxi services have started in ACT namely Ola, Glide Taxi[340] and GoCatch[341]\n\n\nAn interstate NSW TrainLink railway service connects Canberra to Sydney.[342] Canberra railway station is in the inner south suburb of Kingston.[343] Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre, although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt, while plans for a line to Yass were abandoned. A 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge construction railway was built in 1923 between the Yarralumla brickworks and the provisional Parliament House; it was later extended to Civic, but the whole line was closed in May 1927.[344] Train services to Melbourne are provided by way of a NSW TrainLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in Yass, about a one-hour drive from Canberra.[342][345]\n\n\nPlans to establish a high-speed rail service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney,[346] have not been implemented, as the various proposals have been deemed economically unviable.[347][348] The original plans for Canberra included proposals for railed transport within the city,[349] however none eventuated.[349] The phase 2 report of the most recent proposal, the High Speed \nRail Study, was published by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport on 11 April 2013.[350] A railway connecting Canberra to Jervis Bay was also planned but never constructed.[351]\n\n\nCanberra is about three hours by road from Sydney on the Federal Highway (National Highway 23),[352] which connects with the Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near Goulburn, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass.[352] It is a two-hour drive on the Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the Snowy Mountains and the Kosciuszko National Park.[345] Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the Kings Highway.[345]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canberra Airport terminal\nCanberra Airport provides direct domestic services to Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, Sunshine Coast and Sydney with connections to other domestic centres.[353] There are also direct flights to small regional towns: Ballina, Dubbo, Newcastle and Port Macquarie in New South Wales. Canberra Airport is, as of September 2013, designated by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development as a restricted use designated international airport.[354] International flights have previously been operated by both Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways. Fiji Airways has announced direct flights to Nadi commencing in July 2023.[355] Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with RAAF Base Fairbairn. In June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control.[356]\n\n\nCanberra has one of the highest rates of active travel of all Australian major cities, with 7.1 per cent of commuters walking or cycling to work in 2011.[357] An ACT Government survey conducted in late 2010 found that Canberrans walk an average of 26 minutes each day.[358] According to *The Canberra Times* in March 2014, Canberra's cyclists are involved in an average of four reported collisions every week.[359] The newspaper also reported that Canberra is home to 87,000 cyclists, translating to the highest cycling participation rate in Australia; and, with higher popularity, bike injury rates in 2012 were twice the national average.[360]\n\n\nSince late 2020, two scooter-sharing systems have been operational in Canberra: orange scooters from Neuron Mobility and purple scooters from Beam Mobility,[361] both Singapore-based companies that operate in many Australian cities. These services cover much of Canberra Central and Central Belconnen, with plans to expand coverage to more areas of the city in 2022.[362]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mount Majura Solar Farm has a rated output of 2.3 megawatts and was opened on 6 October 2016.[363]\nThe government-owned Icon Water manages Canberra's water and sewerage infrastructure.[364] ActewAGL is a joint venture between ACTEW and AGL, and is the retail provider of Canberra's utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary TransACT.[365]\n\n\nCanberra's water is stored in four reservoirs, the Corin, Bendora and Cotter dams on the Cotter River and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River. Although the Googong Dam is located in New South Wales, it is managed by the ACT government.[366] Icon Water owns Canberra's two wastewater treatment plants, located at Fyshwick and on the lower reaches of the Molonglo River.[367][368]\n\n\nElectricity for Canberra mainly comes from the national power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan).[369] Power was first supplied from the Kingston Powerhouse near the Molonglo River, a thermal plant built in 1913, but this was finally closed in 1957.[370][371] The ACT has four solar farms, which were opened between 2014 and 2017: Royalla (rated output of 20 megawatts, 2014),[372] Mount Majura (2.3 MW, 2016),[363] Mugga Lane (13 MW, 2017)[373] and Williamsdale (11 MW, 2017).[374] In addition, numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels or solar hot water systems. In 2015 and 2016, rooftop solar systems supported by the ACT government's feed-in tariff had a capacity of 26.3 megawatts, producing 34,910 MWh. In the same year, retailer-supported schemes had a capacity of 25.2 megawatts and exported 28,815 MWh to the grid (power consumed locally was not recorded).[375]\n\n\nThere are no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020,[178] raising the target from 210 to 550 megawatts.[376] It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these are expected to be operational by 2017.[377] Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016.[378][379] The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available for the establishment of a facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.[380]\n\n\nThe ACT has the highest rate with internet access at home (94 per cent of households in 2014–15).[381]\n\n\n\n## Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Oceania\n\nCanberra has three sister cities:\n\n\n\n* Beijing, China[284]\n* Nara, Japan[284]\n* Wellington, New Zealand[382]\n\n\nIn addition, Canberra has the following friendship cities:\n\n\n\n* Hangzhou, China: The ACT Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government on 29 October 1998. The Agreement was designed to promote business opportunities and cultural exchanges between the two cities.[383]\n* Dili, East Timor: The Canberra Dili Friendship Agreement was signed in 2004, aiming to build friendship and mutual respect and promote educational, cultural, economic, humanitarian and sporting links between Canberra and Dili.[384]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n\n\n* 1971 Canberra flood\n* 2003 Canberra bushfires\n* List of planned cities\n* List of tallest buildings in Canberra\n* Lists of capitals\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In accordance with the Australian Bureau of Statistics source, England, Scotland, Mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau are listed separately\n2. **^** As a percentage of 373,561 persons who nominated their ancestry at the 2016 census.\n3. **^** The Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most who nominate \"Australian\" as their ancestry are part of the Anglo-Celtic group.[239]\n4. **^** Of any ancestry.

Founded following the federation of the colonies of Australia as the seat of government for the new nation, it is Australia's largest inland city and the eighth-largest Australian city overall. The city is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory[12] at the northern tip of the Australian Alps, the country's highest mountain range. As of June 2022,[update] Canberra's estimated population was 456,692.[2]\n\n\nThe area chosen for the capital had been inhabited by Indigenous Australians for up to 21,000 years,[13] with the principal group being the Ngunnawal people. European settlement commenced in the first half of the 19th century, as evidenced by surviving landmarks such as St John's Anglican Church and Blundells Cottage. On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies of Australia was achieved. Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital,[14] a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least 100 mi (160 km) from Sydney. The capital city was founded and formally named as Canberra in 1913. A blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected after an international design contest, and construction commenced in 1913.[15] Unusual among Australian cities, it is an entirely planned city. The Griffins' plan featured geometric motifs and was centred on axes aligned with significant topographical landmarks such as Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie, Capital Hill and City Hill. Canberra's mountainous location makes it the only mainland Australian city where snow-capped mountains can be seen in winter; although snow in the city itself is uncommon.\n\n\nAs the seat of the Government of Australia, Canberra is home to many important institutions of the federal government, national monuments and museums. This includes Parliament House, Government House, the High Court and the headquarters of numerous government agencies. It is the location of many social and cultural institutions of national significance such as the Australian War Memorial, the Australian National University, the Royal Australian Mint, the Australian Institute of Sport, the National Gallery, the National Museum and the National Library. The city is home to many important institutions of the Australian Defence Force including the Royal Military College Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy. It hosts all foreign embassies in Australia as well as regional headquarters of many international organisations, not-for-profit groups, lobbying groups and professional associations.\n\n\nCanberra has been ranked among the world's best cities to live in and visit.[16][17][18][19][20] Although the Commonwealth Government remains the largest single employer in Canberra, it is no longer the majority employer. Other major industries have developed in the city, including in health care, professional services, education and training, retail, accommodation and food, and construction.[21] Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. At the 2016 Census, 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were reported as having been born overseas.[22]\n\n\nCanberra's design is influenced by the garden city movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation. Its design can be viewed from its highest point at the Telstra Tower and the summit of Mount Ainslie. Other notable features include the National Arboretum, born out of the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and Lake Burley Griffin, named for the city's architects. Highlights in the annual calendar of cultural events include Floriade, the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere,[23][24] the Enlighten Festival, Skyfire, the National Multicultural Festival and Summernats. Canberra's main sporting venues are Canberra Stadium and Manuka Oval. The city is served with domestic and international flights at Canberra Airport, while interstate train and coach services depart from Canberra railway station and the Jolimont Centre respectively. City Interchange is the main hub of Canberra's bus and light rail transport network.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe word \"Canberra\" is derived from the name of a local Ngunnawal clan who resided in the area and were referred to by the early British colonists as either the *Canberry* or *Nganbra* tribe. Joshua John Moore, the first European land-owner in the region, named his grant \"Canberry\" in 1823 after these people. \"Canberry Creek\" and \"Canberry\" first appeared on regional maps from 1830, while the derivative name \"Canberra\" started to appear from around 1857.[25][26][27]\n\n\nNumerous local commentators, including the Ngunnawal elder Don Bell, have speculated upon possible meanings of \"Canberra\" over the years. These include \"meeting place\", \"woman's breasts\" and \"the hollow between a woman's breasts\".[28][29]\n\n\nAlternative proposals for the name of the city during its planning included Austral, Australville, Aurora, Captain Cook, Caucus City, Cookaburra, Dampier, Eden, Eucalypta, Flinders, Gonebroke, Home, Hopetoun, Kangaremu, Myola, Meladneyperbane, New Era, Olympus, Paradise, Shakespeare, Sydmelperadbrisho, Swindleville, The National City, Union City, Unison, Wattleton, Wheatwoolgold, Yass-Canberra.[30][31][32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Canberra\n\nSee also: History of the Australian Capital Territory\n\n### First Nations peoples[edit]\n\n\nThe first peoples of the Canberra area are the Ngunnawal people, while the Ngarigo lived immediately to the south of the ACT (including some of the far-southern suburbs of Canberra), the Wandandian to the east, the Walgulu also to the south, Gandangara people to the north and Wiradjuri to the north-west.\n\n\nThe first British settlers into the Canberra area described two clans of Ngunnawal people resident to the vicinity. The *Canberry* or *Nganbra* clan lived mostly around Sullivan's Creek and had ceremonial grounds at the base of Galambary (Black Mountain), while the *Pialligo* clan had land around what is now Canberra Airport.[33][34] The people living here carefully managed and cultivated the land with fire and farmed yams and hunted for food.[35]\n\n\nArchaeological evidence of settlement in the region includes inhabited rock shelters, rock paintings and engravings, burial places, camps and quarry sites as well as stone tools and arrangements.[36] Artefacts suggests early human activity occurred at some point in the area 21,000 years previously.[13]\n\n\nStill today, Ngunnawal men into the present conduct ceremony on the banks of the river, Murrumbidgee River. They travel upstream as they receive their Totems and corresponding responsibilities for land management. 'Murrum' means 'Pathway' and Bidgee means 'Boss'.[35]\n\n\nThe submerged limestone caves beneath Lake Burley Griffin contained Aboriginal rock art, some of the only sites in the region.[35]\n\n\nGalambary (Black Mountain) is an important Aboriginal meeting and business site, predominantly for men’s business. According to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, Mt Ainslie is primarily for place of women’s business. Black Mountain and Mount Ainslie are referred to as women’s breasts. Galambary was also used by Ngunnawal people as an initiation site, with the mountain itself said to represent the growth of a boy into a man.[35]\n\n\n\n### British exploration and colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St John's Anglican Church, the oldest surviving public building in the inner city, consecrated in 1845\n![](image)Blundells Cottage, built around 1860,[37] is one of the few remaining buildings built by the first white settlers of Canberra. In October 1820, Charles Throsby led the first British expedition to the area.[38][39][40][41] Four other expeditions occurred between 1820 and 1823 with the first accurate map being produced by explorer Mark John Currie in June 1823. By this stage the area had become known as the Limestone Plains.[38][42]\n\n\nBritish settlement of the area probably dates from late 1823, when a sheep station was formed on what is now the Acton Peninsula by James Cowan, the head stockman employed by Joshua John Moore.[43] Moore had received a land grant in the region in 1823 and formally applied to purchase the site on 16 December 1826. He named the property \"Canberry\". On 30 April 1827, Moore was told by letter that he could retain possession of 1,000 acres (405 ha) at Canberry.[44]\n\n\nOther colonists soon followed Moore's example to take up land in the region. Around 1825 James Ainslie, working on behalf of the wealthy merchant Robert Campbell, arrived to establish a sheep station. He was guided to the region by a local Aboriginal girl who showed him the fine lands of her *Pialligo* clan.[33] The area then became the property of Campbell and it was initially named Pialligo before Campbell changed it to the Scottish title of Duntroon.[25][45][46] Campbell's family later built the imposing stone house that is now the officers' mess of the Royal Military College, Duntroon.[47] The Campbells sponsored settlement by other farmer families to work their land, such as the Southwells of \"Weetangera\".[48]\n\n\nOther notable early colonists included Henry Donnison, who established the Yarralumla estate—now the site of the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia—in 1827, and John Palmer who employed Duncan Macfarlane to form the Jerrabomberra property in 1828. A year later, John MacPherson established the Springbank estate, becoming the first British owner-occupier in the region.[25][49][50]\n\n\nThe Anglican church of St John the Baptist, in the suburb of Reid,[51] was consecrated in 1845 and is now the oldest surviving public building in the city.[52][53] St John's churchyard contains the earliest graves in the district.[54] It has been described as a \"sanctuary in the city\",[55][56] remaining a small English village-style church even as the capital grew around it. Canberra's first school, St John's School (now a museum), was situated next to the church and opened in the same year of 1845.[57] It was built to educate local settlers children,[58] including the Blundell children who lived in nearby Blundell's Cottage.[59]\n\n\nAs the European presence increased, the Indigenous population dwindled largely due to the destruction of their society, dislocation from their lands and from introduced diseases such as influenza, smallpox, alcoholism and measles.[60][61]\n\n\n\n### Creation of the nation's capital[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The opening of Parliament House in May 1927\nThe district's change from a rural area in New South Wales to the national capital started during debates over federation in the late 19th century.[62][63] Following a long dispute over whether Sydney or Melbourne should be the national capital,[14] a compromise was reached: the new capital would be built in New South Wales, so long as it was at least 100 mi (160 km) from Sydney,[62] with Melbourne to be the temporary seat of government while the new capital was built.[64] A survey was conducted across several sites in New South Wales with Bombala, southern Monaro, Orange, Yass, Albury, Tamworth, Armidale, Tumut and Dalgety all discussed.[65] Dalgety was chosen by the federal parliament and it passed the *Seat of Government Act 1904* confirming Dalgety as the site of the nation's capital. However, the New South Wales government refused to cede the required territory as they did not accept the site.[65] In 1906, the New South Wales Government finally agreed to cede sufficient land provided that it was in the Yass-Canberra region as this site was closer to Sydney.[62] Newspaper proprietor John Gale circulated a pamphlet titled 'Dalgety or Canberra: Which?' advocating Canberra to every member of the Commonwealth's seven state and federal parliaments. By many accounts, it was decisive in the selection of Canberra as the site in 1908 as was a result of survey work done by the government surveyor Charles Scrivener.[66] The NSW government ceded the district to the federal government in 1911 and the Federal Capital Territory was established.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)Griffin's plan for Canberra\nAn international design competition was launched by the Department of Home Affairs on 30 April 1911, closing on 31 January 1912. The competition was boycotted by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institution of Civil Engineers and their affiliated bodies throughout the British Empire because the Minister for Home Affairs King O'Malley insisted that the final decision was for him to make rather than an expert in city planning.[67] A total of 137 valid entries were received. O'Malley appointed a three-member board to advise him but they could not reach unanimity. On 24 May 1911,[68] O'Malley came down on the side of the majority of the board with the design by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin of Chicago, Illinois, United States, being declared the winner.[69][70] Second was Eliel Saarinen of Finland and third was Alfred Agache of Brazil but resident in Paris, France.[67] O'Malley then appointed a six-member board to advise him on the implementation of the winning design. On 25 November 1912, the board advised that it could not support Griffin's plan in its entirety and suggested an alternative plan of its own devising. This plan incorporated the best features of the three place-getting designs as well as of a fourth design by H. Caswell, R.C.G. Coulter and W. Scott-Griffiths of Sydney, the rights to which it had purchased. It was this composite plan that was endorsed by Parliament and given formal approval by O'Malley on 10 January 1913.[67] In 1913, Griffin was appointed Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction and construction began.[71] On 23 February, King O'Malley drove the first peg in the construction of the future capital city.\n\n\nIn 1912, the government invited suggestions from the public as to the name of the future city. Almost 750 names were suggested. At midday on 12 March 1913,[72][73] Lady Denman, the wife of Governor-General Lord Denman, announced that the city would be named \"Canberra\" at a ceremony at Kurrajong Hill,[74][75][76] which has since become Capital Hill and the site of the present Parliament House.[77] Canberra Day is a public holiday observed in the ACT on the second Monday in March to celebrate the founding of Canberra.[61] After the ceremony, bureaucratic disputes hindered Griffin's work;[78] a Royal Commission in 1916 ruled his authority had been usurped by certain officials and his original plan was reinstated.[79] Griffin's relationship with the Australian authorities was strained and a lack of funding meant that by the time he was fired in 1920, little work had been done.[80][81] By this time, Griffin had revised his plan, overseen the earthworks of major avenues and established the Glenloch Cork Plantation.[82][83]\n\n\n\n### Development throughout 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Canberra's Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia\n![](image)Two of Canberra's best-known landmarks, Parliament House (foreground) and Old Parliament House (background) are aligned with each other\nThe Commonwealth government purchased the pastoral property of Yarralumla in 1913 to provide an official residence for the Governor-General of Australia in the new capital.[84] Renovations began in 1925 to enlarge and modernise the property.[85] In 1927, the property was official dubbed Government House.[84] On 9 May that year, the Commonwealth parliament moved to Canberra with the opening of the Provisional Parliament House.[86][87] The Prime Minister Stanley Bruce had officially taken up residence in The Lodge a few days earlier.[88][89] Planned development of the city slowed significantly during the depression of the 1930s and during World War II.[90] Some projects planned for that time, including Roman Catholic and Anglican cathedrals, were never completed.[91] (Nevertheless, in 1973 the Roman Catholic parish church of St. Christopher was remodelled into St. Christopher's Cathedral, Manuka, serving the Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn. It is the only cathedral in Canberra.[92])\n\n\nFrom 1920 to 1957, three bodies — successively the Federal Capital Advisory Committee,[93] the Federal Capital Commission,[94] and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee — continued to plan the further expansion of Canberra in the absence of Griffin. However, they were only advisory and development decisions were made without consulting them, which increased inefficiency.[82][95]\n\n\nThe largest event in Canberra up to World War II was the 24th Meeting of ANZAAS in January 1939. *The Canberra Times* described it as \"a signal event ... in the history of this, the world's youngest capital city\". The city's accommodation was not nearly sufficient to house the 1,250 delegates and a tent city had to be set up on the banks of the Molonglo River. One of the prominent speakers was H. G. Wells, who was a guest of the Governor-General Lord Gowrie for a week. This event coincided with a heatwave across south-eastern Australia during which the temperature in Canberra reached 108.5 degrees Fahrenheit (42.5 Celsius) on 11 January. On Friday, 13 January, the Black Friday bushfires caused 71 deaths in Victoria and Wells accompanied the Governor-General on his tour of areas threatened by fires.[96]\n\n\nImmediately after the end of the war, Canberra was criticised for resembling a village and its disorganised collection of buildings was deemed ugly.[97][98][99] Canberra was often derisively described as \"several suburbs in search of a city\".[100] Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies regarded the state of the national capital as an embarrassment.[101] Over time his attitude changed from one of contempt to that of championing its development. He fired two ministers charged with the development of the city for poor performance. Menzies remained in office for over a decade and in that time the development of the capital sped up rapidly.[102][103] The population grew by more than 50 per cent in every five-year period from 1955 to 1975.[103] Several Government departments, together with public servants, were moved to Canberra from Melbourne following the war.[104] Government housing projects were undertaken to accommodate the city's growing population.[105]\n\n\nThe National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) formed in 1957 with executive powers and ended four decades of disputes over the shape and design of Lake Burley Griffin — the centrepiece of Griffin's design — and construction was completed in 1964 after four years of work.[106] The completion of the lake finally laid the platform for the development of Griffin's Parliamentary Triangle.[107] Since the initial construction of the lake, various buildings of national importance have been constructed on its shores.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Various civic landmarks line Lake Burley Griffin. Pictured is the National Library and Parliament House (background)\nThe newly built Australian National University was expanded and sculptures as well as monuments were built.[108][109] A new National Library was constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle, followed by the High Court and the National Gallery.[51][110] Suburbs in Canberra Central (often referred to as North Canberra and South Canberra) were further developed in the 1950s and urban development in the districts of Woden Valley and Belconnen commenced in the mid and late 1960s respectively.[111][112] Many of the new suburbs were named after Australian politicians such as Barton, Deakin, Reid, Braddon, Curtin, Chifley and Parkes.[113]\n\n\nOn 9 May 1988, a larger and permanent Parliament House was opened on Capital Hill as part of Australia's bicentenary celebrations.[114][110] The Commonwealth Parliament moved there from the Provisional Parliament House, now known as Old Parliament House.[114]\n\n\n\n### Self-government[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1988, the Australian Capital Territory was granted full self-government by the Commonwealth Parliament, a step proposed as early as 1965.[115] Following the first election on 4 March 1989,[116] a 17-member Legislative Assembly sat at temporary offices at 1 Constitution Avenue, Civic, on 11 May 1989.[117][118] Permanent premises were opened on London Circuit in 1994.[118] The Australian Labor Party formed the ACT's first government, led by the Chief Minister Rosemary Follett, who made history as Australia's first female head of government.[119][120]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Skywhale and Skywhalepapa in 2021\nParts of Canberra were engulfed by bushfires on 18 January 2003 that killed four people, injured 435 and destroyed more than 500 homes as well as the major research telescopes of Australian National University's Mount Stromlo Observatory.[121]\n\n\nThroughout 2013, several events celebrated the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra.[122] On 11 March 2014, the last day of the centennial year, the Canberra Centenary Column was unveiled in City Hill. Other works included *The Skywhale*, a hot air balloon designed by the sculptor Patricia Piccinini,[123] and *StellrScope* by visual media artist Eleanor Gates-Stuart.[124] On 7 February 2021, *The Skywhale* was joined by *Skywhalepapa* to create a *Skywhale family*, an event marked by Skywhale-themed pastries and beer produced by local companies as well as an art pop song entitled \"We are the Skywhales\".[125]\n\n\nIn 2014, Canberra was named the best city to live in the world by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,[16] and was named the third best city to visit in the world by Lonely Planet in 2017.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Canberra region seen from space\nCanberra covers an area of 814.2 km2 (314.4 sq mi)[4] and is located near the Brindabella Ranges (part of the Australian Alps), approximately 150 km (93 mi) inland from Australia's east coast. It has an elevation of approximately 580 m (1,900 ft) AHD;[126] the highest point is Mount Majura at 888 m (2,913 ft).[127][128] Other low mountains include Mount Taylor 855 m (2,805 ft),[129] Mount Ainslie 843 m (2,766 ft),[130] Mount Mugga Mugga 812 m (2,664 ft)[131] and Black Mountain 812 m (2,664 ft).[132][133]\n\n\nThe native forest in the Canberra region was almost wholly eucalypt species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials of a number of species including *Pinus radiata* on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.[134]\n\n\n\n![](image)The location of Canberra within the ACT. Canberra's main districts are shown in yellow: Canberra Central (marked as North Canberra and South Canberra), Woden Valley, Belconnen, Weston Creek, Tuggeranong, and Gungahlin.\nThe urban environs of the city of Canberra straddle the Ginninderra plain, Molonglo plain, the Limestone plain, and the Tuggeranong plain (Isabella's Plain).[135] The Molonglo River which flows across the Molonglo plain has been dammed to form the national capital's iconic feature Lake Burley Griffin.[136] The Molonglo then flows into the Murrumbidgee north-west of Canberra, which in turn flows north-west toward the New South Wales town of Yass. The Queanbeyan River joins the Molonglo River at Oaks Estate just within the ACT.[135]\n\n\nA number of creeks, including Jerrabomberra and Yarralumla Creeks, flow into the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee.[135] Two of these creeks, the Ginninderra and Tuggeranong, have similarly been dammed to form Lakes Ginninderra and Tuggeranong.[137][138][139] Until recently the Molonglo River had a history of sometimes calamitous floods; the area was a flood plain prior to the filling of Lake Burley Griffin.[140][141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Autumn foliage in Canberra\nUnder the Köppen-Geiger classification, Canberra has an oceanic climate (*Cfb*).[142] In January, the warmest month, the average high is approximately 29 °C (84 °F); in July, the coldest month, the average high drops to approximately 12 °C (54 °F).\n\n\nFrost is common in the winter months. Snow is rare in the CBD (central business district) due to being on the leeward (eastern) side of the dividing range, but the surrounding areas get annual snowfall through winter and often the snow-capped Brindabella Range can be seen from the CBD. The last significant snowfall in the city centre was in 1968.[126] Canberra is often affected by foehn winds, especially in winter and spring, evident by its anomalously warm maxima relative to altitude.\n\n\n\nThe highest recorded maximum temperature was 44.0 °C (111.2 °F) on 4 January 2020.[143] Winter 2011 was Canberra's warmest winter on record, approximately 2 °C (4 °F) above the average temperature.[144] \n\n![](image)Long-term temperature increase in Canberra\nThe lowest recorded minimum temperature was −10.0 °C (14.0 °F) on the morning of 11 July 1971.[126] Light snow falls only once in every few years, and is usually not widespread and quickly dissipates.[126]\n\n\nCanberra is protected from the west by the Brindabellas which create a strong rain shadow in Canberra's valleys.[126] Canberra gets 100.4 clear days annually.[145] Annual rainfall is the third lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart)[146] and is spread fairly evenly over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall.[147] Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April,[126] owing to the effect of summer and the mountains. The area is generally sheltered from a westerly wind, though strong northwesterlies can develop. A cool, vigorous afternoon easterly change, colloquially referred to as a 'sea-breeze' or the 'Braidwood Butcher',[148][149] is common during the summer months[150] and often exceeds 40 km/h in the city. Canberra is also less humid than the nearby coastal areas.[126]\n\n\nCanberra was severely affected by smoke haze during the 2019/2020 bushfires. On 1 January 2020, Canberra had the worst air quality of any major city in the world, with an AQI of 7700 (USAQI 949).[151]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Canberra Airport Comparison (1991–2010 averages, extremes to 1939); 578 m AMSL; 35.30° S, 149.20° E\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 44.0(111.2)\n | 42.7(108.9)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 41.6(106.9)\n | 44.0(111.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 14.0(57.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 0.3(32.5)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 4.0(39.2)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 2.8(37.0)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | −3.7(25.3)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −10.0(14.0)\n | −8.5(16.7)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −3.4(25.9)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | 0.3(32.5)\n | −10.0(14.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 61.3(2.41)\n | 55.2(2.17)\n | 37.6(1.48)\n | 27.3(1.07)\n | 31.5(1.24)\n | 50.0(1.97)\n | 44.3(1.74)\n | 43.1(1.70)\n | 55.8(2.20)\n | 50.9(2.00)\n | 68.4(2.69)\n | 54.1(2.13)\n | 579.5(22.81)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 6.8\n | 6.7\n | 5.7\n | 5.4\n | 6.3\n | 9.7\n | 10.0\n | 8.5\n | 9.8\n | 9.1\n | 10.2\n | 7.2\n | 95.4\n |\n| Average afternoon relative humidity (%)\n | 37\n | 40\n | 42\n | 46\n | 54\n | 60\n | 58\n | 52\n | 49\n | 47\n | 41\n | 37\n | 47\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 294.5\n | 254.3\n | 251.1\n | 219.0\n | 186.0\n | 156.0\n | 179.8\n | 217.0\n | 231.0\n | 266.6\n | 267.0\n | 291.4\n | 2,813.7\n |\n| Source 1: Climate averages for Canberra Airport Comparison (1939–2010); averages given are for 1991–2010[145][152] |\n| Source 2: Records from Canberra Airport for more recent extremes[153] |\n\n### Urban structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Suburbs of Canberra\n\n![](image)Inner Canberra demonstrates some aspects of the Griffin plan, in particular the Parliamentary Triangle.\n![](image)An aerial view of the Civic Centre from Mount Ainslie\nCanberra is a planned city and the inner-city area was originally designed by Walter Burley Griffin, a major 20th-century American architect.[154] Within the central area of the city near Lake Burley Griffin, major roads follow a wheel-and-spoke pattern rather than a grid.[155] Griffin's proposal had an abundance of geometric patterns, including concentric hexagonal and octagonal streets emanating from several radii.[155] However, the outer areas of the city, built later, are not laid out geometrically.[156]\n\n\nLake Burley Griffin was deliberately designed so that the orientation of the components was related to various topographical landmarks in Canberra.[157][158] The lakes stretch from east to west and divided the city in two; a land axis perpendicular to the central basin stretches from Capital Hill—the eventual location of the new Parliament House on a mound on the southern side—north northeast across the central basin to the northern banks along Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial.[98] This was designed so that looking from Capital Hill, the War Memorial stood directly at the foot of Mount Ainslie. At the southwestern end of the land axis was Bimberi Peak,[158] the highest mountain in the ACT, approximately 52 km (32 mi) south west of Canberra.[133]\n\n\nThe straight edge of the circular segment that formed the central basin of Lake Burley Griffin was perpendicular to the land axis and designated the water axis, and it extended northwest towards Black Mountain.[158] A line parallel to the water axis, on the northern side of the city, was designated the municipal axis.[159] The municipal axis became the location of Constitution Avenue, which links City Hill in Civic Centre and both Market Centre and the Defence precinct on Russell Hill. Commonwealth Avenue and Kings Avenue were to run from the southern side from Capital Hill to City Hill and Market Centre on the north respectively, and they formed the western and eastern edges of the central basin. The area enclosed by the three avenues was known as the Parliamentary Triangle, and formed the centrepiece of Griffin's work.[158][159]\n\n\n\n![](image)Black Mountain with the landmark Telstra Tower on the right and the National Arboretum in the foreground\nThe Griffins assigned spiritual values to Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, and Red Hill and originally planned to cover each of these in flowers. That way each hill would be covered with a single, primary colour which represented its spiritual value.[160] This part of their plan never came to fruition, as World War I slowed construction and planning disputes led to Griffin's dismissal by Prime Minister Billy Hughes after the war ended.[80][81][161]\n\n\nThe urban areas of Canberra are organised into a hierarchy of districts, town centres, group centres, local suburbs as well as other industrial areas and villages. There are seven residential districts, each of which is divided into smaller suburbs, and most of which have a town centre which is the focus of commercial and social activities.[162] The districts were settled in the following chronological order:\n\n\n\n* Canberra Central, mostly settled in the 1920s and 1930s, with expansion up to the 1960s,[163] 25 suburbs\n* Woden Valley, first settled in 1964,[112] 12 suburbs\n* Belconnen, first settled in 1966,[112] 27 suburbs (2 not yet developed)\n* Weston Creek, settled in 1969, 8 suburbs[164]\n* Tuggeranong, settled in 1974,[165] 18 suburbs\n* Gungahlin, settled in the early 1990s, 18 suburbs (3 not yet developed)\n* Molonglo Valley, development began in 2010, 13 suburbs planned.\n\n\nThe Canberra Central district is substantially based on Walter Burley Griffin's designs.[158][159][166] In 1967 the then National Capital Development Commission adopted the \"Y Plan\" which laid out future urban development in Canberra around a series of central shopping and commercial area known as the 'town centres' linked by freeways, the layout of which roughly resembled the shape of the letter Y,[167] with Tuggeranong at the base of the Y and Belconnen and Gungahlin located at the ends of the arms of the Y.[167]\n\n\nDevelopment in Canberra has been closely regulated by government,[168][169] both through planning processes and the use of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land. Land in the ACT is held on 99-year crown leases from the national government, although most leases are now administered by the Territory government.[170] There have been persistent calls for constraints on development to be liberalised,[169] but also voices in support of planning consistent with the original 'bush capital' and 'urban forest' ideals that underpin Canberra's design.[171]\n\n\nMany of Canberra's suburbs are named after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title.[172] Street names typically follow a particular theme; for example, the streets of Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of Page are named after biologists and naturalists.[172] Most diplomatic missions are located in the suburbs of Yarralumla, Deakin and O'Malley.[173] There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of Fyshwick, Mitchell and Hume.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Canberra and Lake Burley Griffin set against the backdrop of distant New South Wales, taken from the Telstra Tower\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n |\n| Points of Interest Looking South from Mount Ainslie\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1\n | War Memorial |\n| 2\n | Anzac Parade |\n| 3\n | Old Parliament House |\n| 4\n | New Parliament House |\n| 5\n | National Gallery |\n| 6\n | High Court |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 7\n | Questacon |\n| 8\n | National Library |\n| 9\n | Edmund Barton Building |\n| 10\n | Brindabella Ranges |\n| 11\n | Lovett Tower |\n| 12\n | Ben Chifley Building |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 13\n | Lake Burley Griffin |\n| 14\n | Limestone Avenue |\n| 15\n | Fairbairn Avenue |\n| 16\n | Parkes Way |\n| 17\n | R G Casey Building |\n| 18\n | John Gorton Building |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 19\n | King Edward Terrace |\n| 20\n | Presbyterian Church of Saint Andrew |\n| 21\n | St John's Anglican Church |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Sustainability and the environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floriade is held in Commonwealth Park every spring. It is the largest flower festival in the Southern Hemisphere, employing and encouraging environmental practises, including the use of green energy.[175]\nThe average Canberran was responsible for 13.7 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2005.[176] In 2012, the ACT Government legislated greenhouse gas targets to reduce its emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020, 80 per cent by 2050, with no net emissions by 2060.[177] The government announced in 2013 a target for 90% of electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources by 2020,[178] and in 2016 set an ambitious target of 100% by 2020.[179][180]\n\n\nIn 1996 Canberra became the first city in the world to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion.[181] The strategy aimed to achieve a waste-free society by 2010, through the combined efforts of industry, government and community.[182] By early 2010, it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going to landfill, the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.[183][184]\n\n\nPlastic bags made of polyethylene polymer with a thickness of less than 35 µm were banned from retail distribution in the ACT from November 2011.[185][186][187] The ban was introduced by the ACT Government in an effort to make Canberra more sustainable.[186]\n\n\nOf all waste produced in the ACT, 75 per cent is recycled.[188] Average household food waste in the ACT remains above the Australian average, costing an average $641 per household per annum.[189]\n\n\nCanberra's annual Floriade festival features a large display of flowers every Spring in Commonwealth Park. The organisers of the event have a strong environmental standpoint, promoting and using green energy, \"green catering\", sustainable paper, the conservation and saving of water.[175] The event is also smoke-free.[175]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Territory government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly and Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories\n\n![](image)ACT Legislative Assembly  \nand the statue *Ethos* (Tom Bass, 1961)\nThere is no local council or city government for the city of Canberra. The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly performs the roles of both a city council for the city and a territory government for the rest of the Australian Capital Territory.[190] However, the vast majority of the population of the Territory reside in Canberra and the city is therefore the primary focus of the ACT Government.\n\n\nThe assembly consists of 25 members elected from five districts using proportional representation. The five districts are Brindabella, Ginninderra, Kurrajong, Murrumbidgee and Yerrabi, which each elect five members.[191] The Chief Minister is elected by the Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and selects colleagues to serve as ministers alongside him or her in the Executive, known informally as the cabinet.[190]\n\n\nWhereas the ACT has federally been dominated by Labor,[192][193] the Liberals have been able to gain some footing in the ACT Legislative Assembly and were in government during a period of six and half years from 1995 and 2001. Labor took back control of the Assembly in 2001.[119] At the 2004 election, Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and the Labor Party won 9 of the 17 seats allowing them to form the ACT's first majority government.[119] Since 2008, the ACT has been governed by a coalition of Labor and the Greens.[119][194][195] As of 2022[update], the Chief Minister was Andrew Barr from the Australian Labor Party.\n\n\nThe Australian federal government retains some influence over the ACT government. In the administrative sphere, most frequently this is through the actions of the National Capital Authority which is responsible for planning and development in areas of Canberra which are considered to be of national importance or which are central to Griffin's plan for the city,[196] such as the Parliamentary Triangle, Lake Burley Griffin, major approach and processional roads, areas where the Commonwealth retains ownership of the land or undeveloped hills and ridge-lines (which form part of the Canberra Nature Park).[196][197][198] The national government also retains a level of control over the Territory Assembly through the provisions of the *Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988*.[199] This federal act defines the legislative power of the ACT assembly.[200]\n\n\n\n### Federal representation[edit]\n\n\nThe ACT was given its first federal parliamentary representation in 1949 when it gained a seat in the House of Representatives, the Division of Australian Capital Territory.[201][202] However, the ACT member could only vote on matters directly affecting the territory.[202] In 1974, the ACT was allocated two Senate seats and the House of Representatives seat was divided into two.[201] A third was created in 1996, but was abolished in 1998 because of changes to the regional demographic distribution.[192] At the 2019 election, the third seat has been reintroduced as the Division of Bean.\n\n\nThe House of Representatives seats have mostly been held by Labor and usually by comfortable margins.[192][193] The Labor Party has polled at least seven percentage points more than the Liberal Party at every federal election since 1990 and their average lead since then has been 15 percentage points.[119] The ALP and the Liberal Party held one Senate seat each until the 2022 election when Independent candidate David Pocock unseated the Liberal candidate Zed Seselja.[203]\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and policing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory, Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and ACT Policing\n\nSee also: Crime in the Australian Capital Territory\n\n![](image)High Court of Australia\nThe Australian Federal Police (AFP) provides all of the constabulary services in the territory in a manner similar to state police forces, under a contractual agreement with the ACT Government.[204] The AFP does so through its community policing arm ACT Policing.[205]\n\n\nPeople who have been charged with offences are tried either in the ACT Magistrates Court or, for more severe offences, the ACT Supreme Court.[206] Prior to its closure in 2009, prisoners were held in remand at the Belconnen Remand Centre in the ACT but usually imprisoned in New South Wales.[207] The Alexander Maconochie Centre was officially opened on 11 September 2008 by then Chief Minister Jon Stanhope. The total cost for construction was $130 million.[208] The ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal deal with minor civil law actions and other various legal matters.[209][210]\n\n\nCanberra has the lowest rate of crime of any capital city in Australia as of 2019[update].[211] As of 2016[update] the most common crimes in the ACT were property related crimes, unlawful entry with intent and motor vehicle theft. They affected 2,304 and 966 people (580 and 243 per 100,000 persons respectively). Homicide and related offences—murder, attempted murder and manslaughter, but excluding driving causing death and conspiracy to murder—affect 1.0 per 100,000 persons, which is below the national average of 1.9 per 100,000. Rates of sexual assault (64.4 per 100,000 persons) are also below the national average (98.5 per 100,000).[212][213][214] However the 2017 crime statistics showed a rise in some types of personal crime, notably burglaries, thefts and assaults.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Just under a third of Canberrans are employed in the public sector, working in government departments such as the ACT Government\nIn February 2020, the unemployment rate in Canberra was 2.9% which was lower than the national unemployment rate of 5.1%.[215] As a result of low unemployment and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city.[216] The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is $1827 compared with the national average of $1658 (November 2019).[217]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Civic is home to various administrative departments, such as the Department of Education, Skills and Employment\nThe median house price in Canberra as of February 2020 was $745,000, lower than only Sydney among capital cities of more than 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005.[217][218][219] The median weekly rent paid by Canberra residents is higher than rents in all other states and territories.[220] As of January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most expensive in the country.[221] Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply,[222] and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bunda Street in Canberra's shopping district; tourism, retail and hospitality are also major employers.\nThe city's main industry is public administration and safety, which accounted for 27.1% of Gross Territory Product in 2018-19 and employed 32.49% of Canberra's workforce.[224][21] The headquarters of many Australian Public Service agencies are located in Canberra, and Canberra is also host to several Australian Defence Force establishments, most notably the Australian Defence Force headquarters and HMAS *Harman*, which is a naval communications centre that is being converted into a tri-service, multi-user depot.[225] Other major sectors by employment include Health Care (10.54%), Professional Services (9.77%), Education and Training (9.64%), Retail (7.27%), Accommodation & Food (6.39%) and Construction (5.80%).\n\n\n\n[21]\n\n![](image)A growing number of Canberrans work in the science and technology sector, such as at the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex.\nThe former RAAF Fairbairn, adjacent to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport,[226] but the base continues to be used for RAAF VIP flights.[227][228] A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to capitalise on the concentration of government customers; these include Tower Software and RuleBurst.[229][230] A consortium of private and government investors is making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region.[231] A Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node was established in 2019 to grow the ACT's cyber security sector and related space, defence and education industries.[232]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Canberra\n\n![](image)High-density residential apartments; Canberra has one of the fastest growing populations in the nation[233]\nAt the 2021 census, the population of Canberra was 453,558,[233] up from 395,790 at the 2016 census,[234] and 355,596 at the 2011 census.[235] Canberra has been the fastest-growing city in Australia in recent years, having grown 23.3% from 2011-2021.[233]\n\n\nCanberrans are relatively young, highly mobile and well educated. The median age is 35 years and only 12.7% of the population is aged over 65 years.[234] Between 1996 and 2001, 61.9% of the population either moved to or from Canberra, which was the second highest mobility rate of any Australian capital city.[236] As at May 2017, 43% of ACT residents (25–64) had a level of educational attainment equal to at least a bachelor's degree, significantly higher that the national average of 31%.[237]\n\n\nAccording to statistics collected by the National Australia Bank and reported in *The Canberra Times*, Canberrans on average give significantly more money to charity than Australians in other states and territories, for both dollar giving and as a proportion of income.[238]\n\n\n\n### Ancestry and immigration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The annual Canberra Nara Candle Festival\n\n\nCountry of birth (2016)[22]\n| Birthplace[N 1] | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | 269,682\n |\n| England | 12,739\n |\n| Mainland China | 11,334\n |\n| India | 10,405\n |\n| New Zealand | 4,722\n |\n| Philippines | 3,789\n |\n| Vietnam | 3,340\n |\n| United States | 2,775\n |\n| Sri Lanka | 2,774\n |\n| Malaysia | 2,431\n |\n| South Korea | 2,283\n |\n\n\nAt the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were:[N 2][22]\n\n\n\n* English (35%)\n* Australian (34%)[N 3]\n* Irish (14%)\n* Scottish (11%)\n* Chinese (6%)\n* German (4.7%)\n* Indian (3.9%)\n* Italian (3.5%)\n* Dutch (1.7%)\n* Indigenous (1.6%)[N 4]\n* Filipino (1.3%)\n* Vietnamese (1.3%)\n* Greek (1.3%)\n* Croatian (1.2%)\n* Polish (1.1%)\n\nThe 2016 census showed that 32% of Canberra's inhabitants were born overseas.[22] Of inhabitants born outside Australia, the most prevalent countries of birth were England, China, India, New Zealand and the Philippines.[240]\n\n\n1.6% of the population, or 6,476 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.[N 5][22]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2016 census, 72.7% of people spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Mandarin (3.1%), Vietnamese (1.1%), Cantonese (1%), Hindi (0.9%) and Spanish (0.8%).[22]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nOn census night in 2016, approximately 50.0% of ACT residents described themselves as Christian (excluding not stated responses), the most common denominations being Catholic and Anglican; 36.2% described themselves as having no religion.[234]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in the Australian Capital Territory\n\n![](image)ANU School of Art (formerly the Canberra High School)\nThe two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively.[241][242] Established in 1946,[243] the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by *The Times Higher Education Supplement* and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings.[242][244] There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University;[245] St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.[246] The ACT Government announced on 5 March 2020 that the CIT campus and an adjoining carpark in Reid would be leased to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) for a peppercorn lease, for it to develop as a campus for a new UNSW Canberra.[247] UNSW released a master plan in 2021 for a 6,000 student campus to be realised over 15 years at a cost of $1 billion.[248]\n\n\nThe Australian Defence College has two campuses: the Australian Command and Staff College (ACSC) plus the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies (CDSS) at Weston, and the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) beside the Royal Military College, Duntroon located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell.[249][250] ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales;[251][252] Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training.[253]\n\n\nTertiary level vocational education is also available through the Canberra Institute of Technology (CIT), with campuses in Bruce, Reid, Gungahlin, Tuggeranong and Fyshwick.[254] The combined enrolment of the CIT campuses was over 28,000 students in 2019.[255] Following the transfer of land in Reid for the new UNSW Canberra, a new CIT Woden is scheduled to be completed by 2025.[256]\n\n\nIn 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private.[257] During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its *Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools* policy.[258] As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools was to proceed over a decade. The closure of schools provoked significant opposition.[259][260][261] Most suburbs were planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these were usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities were easily available.[262] Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6 per cent of ACT enrollments.[263]\n\n\n\n### Arts and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Music of Canberra\n\n![](image)National Film and Sound Archive\nCanberra is home to many national monuments and institutions such as the Australian War Memorial, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Portrait Gallery, the National Library,[166] the National Archives,[264] the Australian Academy of Science,[265] the National Film & Sound Archive and the National Museum.[166] Many Commonwealth government buildings in Canberra are open to the public, including Parliament House, the High Court and the Royal Australian Mint.[266][267][268]\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Australia established in 2001 records Australia's social history and is one of Canberra's more architecturally daring buildings.\nLake Burley Griffin is the site of the Captain James Cook Memorial and the National Carillon.[166] Other sites of interest include the Australian–American Memorial, Commonwealth Park, Commonwealth Place, the Telstra Tower, the Australian National Botanic Gardens, the National Zoo and Aquarium, the National Dinosaur Museum, and Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre.[166][269]\n\n![](image)The Australian War Memorial\nThe Canberra Museum and Gallery in the city is a repository of local history and art, housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions.[270] Several historic homes are open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the Tuggeranong Valley,[271][272] Mugga-Mugga in Symonston,[273] and Blundells' Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers.[37] Calthorpes' House in Red Hill is a well-preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days.[274] Strathnairn Homestead is an historic building which also dates from the 1920s.\n\n\nCanberra has many venues for live music and theatre: the Canberra Theatre and Playhouse which hosts many major concerts and productions;[275] and Llewellyn Hall (within the ANU School of Music), a world-class concert hall are two of the most notable.[276] The Street Theatre is a venue with less mainstream offerings.[276] The Albert Hall was the city's first performing arts venue, opened in 1928. It was the original performance venue for theatre groups such as the Canberra Repertory Society.[277]\n\n\n\n![](image)The annual Skyfire fireworks display over Lake Burley Griffin, held during the Enlighten Festival\nStonefest was a large annual festival, for some years one of the biggest festivals in Canberra.[278][279] It was downsized and rebranded as Stone Day in 2012.[280] There are numerous bars and nightclubs which also offer live entertainment, particularly concentrated in the areas of Dickson, Kingston and the city.[281] Most town centres have facilities for a community theatre and a cinema, and they all have a library.[282] Popular cultural events include the National Folk Festival, the Royal Canberra Show, the Summernats car festival, Enlighten festival, the National Multicultural Festival in February and the *Celebrate Canberra* festival held over 10 days in March in conjunction with Canberra Day.[283]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Toku* in the Canberra-Nara Peace Park, which is located in the Lennox Gardens\nCanberra maintains sister-city relationships with both Nara, Japan and Beijing, China. Canberra has friendship-city relationships with both Dili, East Timor and Hangzhou, China.[284] City-to-city relationships encourage communities and special interest groups both locally and abroad to engage in a wide range of exchange activities. The Canberra Nara Candle Festival held annually in spring, is a community celebration of the Canberra Nara Sister City relationship.[285] The festival is held in Canberra Nara Park on the shores of Lake Burley Griffin.[286]\n\n\nThe history of Canberra was told in the 1938 radio feature *Canberra the Great*.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nAs Australia's capital, Canberra is the most important centre for much of Australia's political reportage and thus all the major media, including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the commercial television networks, and the metropolitan newspapers maintain local bureaus. News organisations are represented in the \"press gallery\", a group of journalists who report on the national parliament. The National Press Club of Australia in Barton has regular television broadcasts of its lunches at which a prominent guest, typically a politician or other public figure, delivers a speech followed by a question-and-answer session.[287]\n\n\nCanberra has a daily newspaper, *The Canberra Times*, which was established in 1926.[288][289] There are also several free weekly publications, including news magazines *CityNews* and *Canberra Weekly* as well as entertainment guide *BMA Magazine*. *BMA Magazine* first went to print in 1992; the inaugural edition featured coverage of the Nirvana Nevermind tour.[290]\n\n\nThere are a number of AM and FM stations broadcasting in Canberra (AM/FM Listing). The main commercial operators are the Capital Radio Network (2CA and 2CC), and Austereo/ARN (104.7 and Mix 106.3). There are also several community operated stations.  \n\nA DAB+ digital radio trial is also in operation, it simulcasts some of the AM/FM stations, and also provides several digital only stations (DAB+ Trial Listing).\n\n\nFive free-to-air television stations service Canberra:\n\n\n\n* ABC Canberra (ABC)\n* SBS New South Wales (SBS)\n* Southern Cross 10 Southern NSW & ACT (CTC) – Network 10 affiliate\n* Seven Network Southern NSW & ACT (CBN) – Seven Network owned and operated station\n* WIN Television Southern NSW & ACT (WIN) – Nine Network affiliate\n\n\nEach station broadcasts a primary channel and several multichannels. Of the three main commercial networks:\n\n\n\n* WIN airs a half-hour local *WIN News* each weeknight at 6pm, produced from a newsroom in the city and broadcast from studios in Wollongong.\n* Southern Cross 10 airs short local news updates throughout the day, produced and broadcast from its Hobart studios. It previously aired a regional edition of *Nine News* from Sydney each weeknight at 6pm, featuring opt-outs for Canberra and the ACT when it was a Nine affiliate.\n* Seven airs short local news and weather updates throughout the day, produced and broadcast from its Canberra studios.\n\n\nPrior to 1989, Canberra was serviced by just the ABC, SBS and Capital Television (CTC), which later became Ten Capital in 1994 then Southern Cross Ten in 2002 then Channel 9/Southern Cross Nine in 2016 and finally Channel 10 in 2021, with Prime Television (now Prime7) and WIN Television arriving as part of the Government's regional aggregation program in that year.[291]\n\n\nPay television services are available from Foxtel (via satellite) and telecommunications company TransACT (via cable).[292]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in the Australian Capital Territory\n\n![](image)A rugby league match at Canberra Stadium\nIn addition to local sporting leagues, Canberra has a number of sporting teams that compete in national and international competitions. The best known teams are the Canberra Raiders and the Brumbies who play rugby league and rugby union respectively; both have been champions of their leagues.[293][294] Both teams play their home games at Canberra Stadium,[295] which is the city's largest stadium and was used to hold group matches in soccer for the 2000 Summer Olympics and in rugby union for the 2003 Rugby World Cup.[296][297] The city also has a successful basketball team, the Canberra Capitals, which has won seven out of the last eleven national women's basketball titles.[298] Canberra United FC represents the city in the A-League Women (formerly the W-League), the national women's association football league, and were champions in the 2011–12 season.[299]\nThe Canberra Vikings represent the city in the National Rugby Championship and finished second in the 2015 season.\n\n\nThere are also teams that participate in national competitions in netball, field hockey, ice hockey, cricket and baseball.\n\n\nThe historic Prime Minister's XI cricket match is played at Manuka Oval annually.[300] Other significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon[301] and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\nCanberra has been bidding for an Australian Football League club since 1981 when Australian rules football in the Australian Capital Territory was more popular.[302] While the league has knocked back numerous proposals, according to the AFL Canberra belongs to the Greater Western Sydney Giants[303] who play three home games at Manuka Oval each season.\n\n\nOther significant annual sporting events include the Canberra Marathon[301] and the City of Canberra Half Ironman Triathlon.\n\n\nThe Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) is located in the Canberra suburb of Bruce.[304] The AIS is a specialised educational and training institution providing coaching for elite junior and senior athletes in a number of sports. The AIS has been operating since 1981 and has achieved significant success in producing elite athletes, both local and international.[304] The majority of Australia's team members and medallists at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney were AIS graduates.[305]\n\n\nCanberra has numerous sporting ovals, golf courses, skate parks, and swimming pools that are open to the public. Tennis courts include those at the National Sports Club, Lyneham, former home of the Canberra Women's Tennis Classic. A Canberra-wide series of bicycle paths are available to cyclists for recreational and sporting purposes. Canberra Nature Parks have a large range of walking paths, horse and mountain bike trails. Water sports like sailing, rowing, dragon boating and water skiing are held on Canberra's lakes.[306][307] The Rally of Canberra is an annual motor sport event, and from 2000 to 2002, Canberra hosted the Canberra 400 event for V8 Supercars on the temporary Canberra Street Circuit, which was located inside the Parliamentary Triangle.\n\n\nA popular form of exercise for people working near or in the Parliamentary Triangle is to do the \"bridge to bridge walk/run\" of about 5 km around Lake Burley Griffin, crossing the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge and Kings Avenue Bridge, using the paths beside the lake. The walk takes about 1 hour, making it ideal for a lunchtime excursion. This is also popular on weekends. Such was the popularity during the COVID-19 isolation in 2020 that the ACT Government initiated a 'Clockwise is COVID-wise' rule for walkers and runners.[308]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Canberra Hospital\nCanberra has two large public hospitals, the approximately 600-bed Canberra Hospital—formerly the Woden Valley Hospital—in Garran and the 174-bed Calvary Public Hospital in Bruce. Both are teaching institutions.[309][310][311][312] The largest private hospital is the Calvary John James Hospital in Deakin.[313][314] Calvary Private Hospital in Bruce and Healthscope's National Capital Private Hospital in Garran are also major healthcare providers.[309][311]\n\n\nThe Royal Canberra Hospital was located on Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin; it was closed in 1991 and was demolished in 1997 in a controversial and fatal implosion to facilitate construction of the National Museum of Australia.[108][159][166][315][316] The city has 10 aged care facilities. Canberra's hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales,[317] and ACT Ambulance Service is one of four operational agencies of the ACT Emergency Services Authority.[318] NETS provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter-hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales.[319]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Glenloch Interchange connects the Tuggeranong Parkway with Parkes Way\n![](image)ACTION Volgren bodied Scania K360UA\n![](image)Alinga Street light rail station\nThe automobile is by far the dominant form of transport in Canberra.[320] The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density;[321] this also means that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.[322]\n\n\nCanberra's districts are generally connected by parkways—limited access dual carriageway roads[320][323] with speed limits generally set at a maximum of 100 km/h (62 mph).[324][325] An example is the Tuggeranong Parkway which links Canberra's CBD and Tuggeranong, and bypasses Weston Creek.[326] In most districts, discrete residential suburbs are bounded by main arterial roads with only a few residential linking in, to deter non-local traffic from cutting through areas of housing.[327]\n\n\nIn an effort to improve road safety, traffic cameras were first introduced to Canberra by the Kate Carnell Government in 1999.[328] The traffic cameras installed in Canberra include fixed red-light and speed cameras and point-to-point speed cameras; together they bring in revenue of approximately $11 million per year in fines.[328]\n\n\nACTION, the government-operated bus service, provides public transport throughout the city.[329] CDC Canberra provides bus services between Canberra and nearby areas of New South Wales of (Murrumbateman and Yass)[330] and as Qcity Transit (Queanbeyan).[331] A light rail line commenced service on 20 April 2019 linking the CBD with the northern district of Gungahlin.[332] A planned Stage 2A of Canberra's light rail network will run from Alinga Street station to Commonwealth Park, adding three new stops at City West, City South and Commonwealth Park.[333] In February 2021 ACT Minister for Transport and City Services Chris Steel said he expects construction on Stage 2A to commence in the 2021-22 financial year, and for \"tracks to be laid\" by the next Territory election in 2024.[334] At the 2016 census, 7.1% of the journeys to work involved public transport, while 4.5% walked to work.[234]\n\n\nThere are two local taxi companies. Aerial Capital Group enjoyed monopoly status until the arrival of Cabxpress in 2007.[335] In October 2015 the ACT Government passed legislation to regulate ride sharing, allowing ride share services including Uber to operate legally in Canberra.[336][337][338] The ACT Government was the first jurisdiction in Australia to enact legislation to regulate the service.[339] Since then many other ride sharing and taxi services have started in ACT namely Ola, Glide Taxi[340] and GoCatch[341]\n\n\nAn interstate NSW TrainLink railway service connects Canberra to Sydney.[342] Canberra railway station is in the inner south suburb of Kingston.[343] Between 1920 and 1922 the train line crossed the Molonglo River and ran as far north as the city centre, although the line was closed following major flooding and was never rebuilt, while plans for a line to Yass were abandoned. A 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) gauge construction railway was built in 1923 between the Yarralumla brickworks and the provisional Parliament House; it was later extended to Civic, but the whole line was closed in May 1927.[344] Train services to Melbourne are provided by way of a NSW TrainLink bus service which connects with a rail service between Sydney and Melbourne in Yass, about a one-hour drive from Canberra.[342][345]\n\n\nPlans to establish a high-speed rail service between Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney,[346] have not been implemented, as the various proposals have been deemed economically unviable.[347][348] The original plans for Canberra included proposals for railed transport within the city,[349] however none eventuated.[349] The phase 2 report of the most recent proposal, the High Speed \nRail Study, was published by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport on 11 April 2013.[350] A railway connecting Canberra to Jervis Bay was also planned but never constructed.[351]\n\n\nCanberra is about three hours by road from Sydney on the Federal Highway (National Highway 23),[352] which connects with the Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near Goulburn, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass.[352] It is a two-hour drive on the Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the Snowy Mountains and the Kosciuszko National Park.[345] Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the Kings Highway.[345]\n\n\n\n![](image)Canberra Airport terminal\nCanberra Airport provides direct domestic services to Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Gold Coast, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, Sunshine Coast and Sydney with connections to other domestic centres.[353] There are also direct flights to small regional towns: Ballina, Dubbo, Newcastle and Port Macquarie in New South Wales. Canberra Airport is, as of September 2013, designated by the Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development as a restricted use designated international airport.[354] International flights have previously been operated by both Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways. Fiji Airways has announced direct flights to Nadi commencing in July 2023.[355] Until 2003 the civilian airport shared runways with RAAF Base Fairbairn. In June of that year, the Air Force base was decommissioned and from that time the airport was fully under civilian control.[356]\n\n\nCanberra has one of the highest rates of active travel of all Australian major cities, with 7.1 per cent of commuters walking or cycling to work in 2011.[357] An ACT Government survey conducted in late 2010 found that Canberrans walk an average of 26 minutes each day.[358] According to *The Canberra Times* in March 2014, Canberra's cyclists are involved in an average of four reported collisions every week.[359] The newspaper also reported that Canberra is home to 87,000 cyclists, translating to the highest cycling participation rate in Australia; and, with higher popularity, bike injury rates in 2012 were twice the national average.[360]\n\n\nSince late 2020, two scooter-sharing systems have been operational in Canberra: orange scooters from Neuron Mobility and purple scooters from Beam Mobility,[361] both Singapore-based companies that operate in many Australian cities. These services cover much of Canberra Central and Central Belconnen, with plans to expand coverage to more areas of the city in 2022.[362]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mount Majura Solar Farm has a rated output of 2.3 megawatts and was opened on 6 October 2016.[363]\nThe government-owned Icon Water manages Canberra's water and sewerage infrastructure.[364] ActewAGL is a joint venture between ACTEW and AGL, and is the retail provider of Canberra's utility services including water, natural gas, electricity, and also some telecommunications services via a subsidiary TransACT.[365]\n\n\nCanberra's water is stored in four reservoirs, the Corin, Bendora and Cotter dams on the Cotter River and the Googong Dam on the Queanbeyan River. Although the Googong Dam is located in New South Wales, it is managed by the ACT government.[366] Icon Water owns Canberra's two wastewater treatment plants, located at Fyshwick and on the lower reaches of the Molonglo River.[367][368]\n\n\nElectricity for Canberra mainly comes from the national power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan).[369] Power was first supplied from the Kingston Powerhouse near the Molonglo River, a thermal plant built in 1913, but this was finally closed in 1957.[370][371] The ACT has four solar farms, which were opened between 2014 and 2017: Royalla (rated output of 20 megawatts, 2014),[372] Mount Majura (2.3 MW, 2016),[363] Mugga Lane (13 MW, 2017)[373] and Williamsdale (11 MW, 2017).[374] In addition, numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels or solar hot water systems. In 2015 and 2016, rooftop solar systems supported by the ACT government's feed-in tariff had a capacity of 26.3 megawatts, producing 34,910 MWh. In the same year, retailer-supported schemes had a capacity of 25.2 megawatts and exported 28,815 MWh to the grid (power consumed locally was not recorded).[375]\n\n\nThere are no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020,[178] raising the target from 210 to 550 megawatts.[376] It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these are expected to be operational by 2017.[377] Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016.[378][379] The ACT government announced in 2014 that up to 23 megawatts of feed-in-tariff entitlements would be made available for the establishment of a facility in the ACT or surrounding region for burning household and business waste to produce electricity by 2020.[380]\n\n\nThe ACT has the highest rate with internet access at home (94 per cent of households in 2014–15).[381]\n\n\n\n## Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Oceania\n\nCanberra has three sister cities:\n\n\n\n* Beijing, China[284]\n* Nara, Japan[284]\n* Wellington, New Zealand[382]\n\n\nIn addition, Canberra has the following friendship cities:\n\n\n\n* Hangzhou, China: The ACT Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government on 29 October 1998. The Agreement was designed to promote business opportunities and cultural exchanges between the two cities.[383]\n* Dili, East Timor: The Canberra Dili Friendship Agreement was signed in 2004, aiming to build friendship and mutual respect and promote educational, cultural, economic, humanitarian and sporting links between Canberra and Dili.[384]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n\n\n* 1971 Canberra flood\n* 2003 Canberra bushfires\n* List of planned cities\n* List of tallest buildings in Canberra\n* Lists of capitals\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In accordance with the Australian Bureau of Statistics source, England, Scotland, Mainland China and the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau are listed separately\n2. **^** As a percentage of 373,561 persons who nominated their ancestry at the 2016 census.\n3. **^** The Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most who nominate \"Australian\" as their ancestry are part of the Anglo-Celtic group.[239]\n4. **^** Of any ancestry.
