'officials' speech') is a group of Sinitic dialects that are natively spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of the phonology of Standard Chinese, the official language of China. Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as **Northern Chinese** (simplified Chinese: 北方话; traditional Chinese: 北方話; pinyin: *Běifānghuà*; lit. 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such as those of the Southwest (including Sichuanese) and the Lower Yangtze, are not mutually intelligible with the standard language (or are only partially intelligible). Nevertheless, Mandarin as a group is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly one billion).\n\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the Chinese dialect groups; it is spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area that stretches from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four tones. The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final glottal stop. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain retroflex initial consonants, which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese.\n\n\nThe Chinese capital has been within the Mandarin-speaking area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a lingua franca for government officials and the courts since the 14th century.[3] By the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the national language. Standard Mandarin Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of China[4] and Taiwan,[5] as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is also used as one of the official languages of the United Nations.[6] Recent increased migration from Mandarin-speaking regions of China and Taiwan has now resulted in the language being one of the more frequently used varieties of Chinese among Chinese diaspora communities. It is also the most commonly taught Chinese variety.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe English word \"mandarin\" (from Portuguese *mandarim*, from Malay *menteri*, from Sanskrit *mantrī*, *mantrin*, meaning 'minister or counsellor') originally meant an official of the Ming and Qing empires.[7][8][a]\nSince their native varieties were often mutually unintelligible, these officials communicated using a koiné language based on various northern varieties. When Jesuit missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name *Guānhuà* (官话; 官話; 'language of the officials').[10]\n\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to Standard Chinese, which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Mandarin Chinese is based on Beijing dialect, with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan (Republic of China, ROC), as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore, and a high-prestige minority language[11] in Malaysia. It also functions as the language of instruction in mainland China and Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\n\n\n\n* *Pǔtōnghuà* (普通话; 普通話; 'common speech') in mainland China,\n* *Guóyǔ* (国语; 國語; 'national language')) in Taiwan or\n* *Huáyǔ* (华语; 華語; 'Huaxia language') in Malaysia and Singapore,\n\n\nbut not as *Guānhuà*.[3]\n\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call *Guānhuà*'. The alternative term *Běifānghuà* (北方话; 北方話; 'Northern dialects'), is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name—for example the Sichuan dialect and the Hebei dialect or Northeastern dialect, all being regarded as distinct from the standard language, with which they may not share much mutual intelligibility.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Chinese language\n\nThe hundreds of modern local varieties of Chinese developed from regional variants of Old Chinese and Middle Chinese. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are Wu, Gan, and Xiang in central China and Min, Hakka, and Yue on the southeast coast.[12] The *Language Atlas of China* (1987) distinguishes three further groups: Jin (split from Mandarin), Huizhou in the Huizhou region of Anhui and Zhejiang, and Pinghua in Guangxi and Yunnan.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Old Mandarin[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Old Mandarin\n\n![](image)A page of the *Menggu Ziyun*, covering the syllables *tsim* to *lim*\nAfter the fall of the Northern Song (959–1126) and during the reign of the Jin (1115–1234) and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common form of speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the *qu* and *sanqu* poetry.[15]\n\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a rime dictionary called the *Zhongyuan Yinyun* (1324). A radical departure from the rime table tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the 'Phags-pa script based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the *Menggu Ziyun*, a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.[16]\n\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial stops and affricates showed a three-way contrast between tenuis, voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were four tones, with the fourth or \"entering tone\", a checked tone comprising syllables ending in plosives (*-p*, *-t* or *-k*). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch and by the late Tang dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.[17]\n\n\nThe *Zhongyuan Yinyun* shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final *-m*, which has merged with *-n* in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered *j-*, *q-* and *x-* in pinyin).[18]\n\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun *tā* (他), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.[19]\n\n\n\n### Vernacular literature[edit]\n\n\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in Literary Chinese, which was modeled on the classics of the Warring States period and the Han dynasty. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, 翼 (*yì*; 'wing') is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 homophones in Standard Chinese.\n\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for documents that were meant to be performed or recited, such as plays or stories. From at least the Yuan dynasty plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as *Water Margin*, on down to the Qing dynasty novel *Dream of the Red Chamber* and beyond, there developed a literature in written vernacular Chinese (白话; 白話; *báihuà*). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.[20]\n\n\nHu Shih, a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled \"A History of Vernacular Literature\" (*Báihuà Wénxuéshǐ*).\n\n\n\n### Late imperial koiné[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)\n\n![](image)*Zhongguo Guanhua* (中國官話), or *Medii Regni Communis Loquela* (\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by Étienne Fourmont (with Arcadio Huang) in 1742[21]\n\n> The Chinese have different languages in different provinces, to such an extent that they cannot understand each other.... [They] also have another language which is like a universal and common language; this is the official language of the mandarins and of the court; it is among them like Latin among ourselves.... Two of our fathers [Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci] have been learning this mandarin language...  \n>  — Alessandro Valignano, *Historia del principio y progresso de la Compañía de Jesús en las Indias Orientales*, I:28 (1542–1564)[22]\n> \n\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people living in many parts of South China spoke only their local variety. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as *Guānhuà*. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.[3]\n\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the Yongzheng Emperor, unable to understand the accents of officials from Guangdong and Fujian, issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation (正音書院; *Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn*) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n\n\n\n* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for *v-*\n* merger of *-m* finals with *-n*\n* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in \"entering tone\" syllables\n* retention of the distinction between palatalized velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings \"Peking\" and \"Tientsin\" for modern \"Beijing\" and \"Tianjin\".[23]\n\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a koiné based on dialects spoken in the Nanjing area, though not identical to any single dialect.[24] This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to Beijing in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard. As late as 1815, Robert Morrison based the first English–Chinese dictionary on this koiné as the standard of the time, though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence.[25] By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.[26]\n\n\n\n### Standard Mandarin Chinese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Standard Chinese\n\nThe variant of Mandarin as spoken by educated classes in Beijing was made the official language of China by the Qing dynasty in the early 1900s and the successive Republican government. In the early years of the Republic of China, intellectuals of the New Culture Movement, such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu, successfully campaigned for the replacement of Literary Chinese as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language (traditional Chinese: 國語; simplified Chinese: 国语; pinyin: *Guóyǔ*; Wade–Giles: *Kuo²-yü³*). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it *pǔtōnghuà* (simplified Chinese: 普通话; traditional Chinese: 普通話; lit. 'common speech').[27] Some 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984. Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.[28]\n\n\nThis standard language is now used in education, the media, and formal occasions in both mainland China and Taiwan, as well as among the Chinese community of Singapore.[29][30] However in other parts of the Chinese-speaking world, namely Hong Kong and Macau, the standard form of Chinese used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local Cantonese because of their colonial and linguistic history.[31] While Standard Mandarin is now the medium of instruction in schools throughout China, it still has yet to gain traction as a common language among the local population in areas where Mandarin dialects are not native.[32] In these regions, people may be either diglossic or speak the standard language with a notable accent.[33] However since the start of the 21st century, there has been an effort of mass education in Standard Mandarin Chinese and discouragement of local language usage by the Chinese government in order to erase these regional differences.[34]\n\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. The codified forms of both *Pǔtōnghuà* and *Guóyǔ* base their phonology on the Beijing accent, and also take some elements from other sources, and deviate from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics.[35] Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect.[36]\n\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although simplified characters are used in mainland China and Singapore, while traditional characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.[37] Singapore has followed mainland China in officially adopting simplified characters.[38]\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nMandarin is spoken across northern and southwestern China, with some pockets in neighbouring countries.\nUnlike their compatriots on the southeast coast, few Mandarin speakers engaged in overseas emigration until the late 20th century, but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world.[39]\n\n\n\n### Mainland China[edit]\n\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.[40][41]\n\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar,[42] and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.[b]\n\n\nMost of northeast China, except for Liaoning, did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,[48] and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from the Beijing dialect.[49] The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern Xinjiang, where Xibe, a modern dialect, is spoken.[50]\n\n\nThe frontier areas of northwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time, and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area.[49] The Southwest was settled early, but the population fell dramatically for obscure reasons in the 13th century, and did not recover until the 17th century.[49] The dialects in this area are now relatively uniform.[39] However, long-established cities even very close to Beijing, such as Tianjin, Baoding, Shenyang, and Dalian, have markedly different dialects.\n\n\n\n### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taiwanese Mandarin\n\nStandard Mandarin is the official language of Taiwan. The Taiwanese standard of Mandarin differs very little from that of mainland China, with differences largely in some technical vocabulary developed from the 1950s onwards.[51]\n\n\nWhile the spoken standard of Taiwanese Mandarin is nearly identical to that of mainland China, the colloquial form has been heavily influenced by other local languages, especially Taiwanese Hokkien. Notable differences include: the merger of retroflex sounds (zh, ch, sh, r) with the alveolar series (z, c, s), frequent mergers of the \"neutral tone\" with a word's original tone, and absence of erhua.[52] Code-switching between Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien is common, as the majority of the population continues to also speak the latter as a native language.[53]\n\n\n\n### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### Singapore[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singaporean Mandarin\n\nMandarin is one of the four official languages of Singapore along with English, Malay, and Tamil. Historically, it was seldom used by the Chinese Singaporean community, which primarily spoke the Southern Chinese languages of Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, or Hakka.[54] The launch of the Speak Mandarin Campaign in 1979 by the government prioritized the language over traditional vernaculars in an attempt to create a common ethnic language and foster closer connections to China.[55] This has led to a significant increase and presence of Mandarin usage in the country, coupled with a strong decline in usage of other Chinese variants.\n\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin is nearly identical to the standards of China and Taiwan, with minor vocabulary differences. It is the Mandarin variant used in education, media, and official settings. Meanwhile, a colloquial form called Singdarin is used in informal daily life and is heavily influenced in terms of both grammar and vocabulary by local languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, and Malay. Instances of code-switching with English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay, or a combination of any of these is also common.\n\n\n\n#### Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malaysian Mandarin\n\nIn Malaysia, Mandarin has been adopted by local Chinese-language schools as the medium of instruction with the standard based on that of Singapore. However, it is not as widespread in daily life among the Malaysian Chinese community, as Hokkien speakers continue to form a plurality among the ethnic Chinese population and Cantonese serves as the common language (especially in commerce and local media).[56] An exception is in the state of Johor, where Mandarin is increasingly used alongside Cantonese as a lingua franca in part due to Singaporean influence.[57] As in Singapore, the local colloquial variant of Mandarin exhibits influences from Cantonese and Malay.\n\n\n\n#### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese people in Myanmar\n\nIn northern Myanmar, a Southwestern Mandarin variant close to the Yunnanese dialect is spoken by local Chinese and other ethnic groups. In some rebel group-controlled regions, Mandarin also serves as the lingua franca.[58]\n\n\n\n### Central Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dungan language\n\nThe Dungan people of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are descendents of Hui people who fled to the Russian Empire from Dzungaria in 1877 after the fall of Kashgaria to Qing forces and from the Ili valley after it was ceded to China in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1881.[59]\nThey speak two dialects, descended from Mandarin dialects of Gansu and Shaanxi, and write their language in the Cyrillic script.[60]\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\n### Boundaries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of varieties of Chinese\n\nThe classification of Chinese dialects evolved during the 20th century, and many points remain unsettled. Early classifications tended to follow provincial boundaries or major geographical features.[61]\n\n\nIn 1936, Wang Li produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria, principally the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials. His Mandarin group included dialects of northern and southwestern China, as well as those of Hunan and northern Jiangxi.[62]\nLi Fang-Kuei's classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as Xiang and Gan, while splitting the remaining Mandarin dialects between Northern, Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Mandarin groups.[63]\n\n\nThe widely accepted seven-group classification of Yuan Jiahua in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate, with Mandarin divided into Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern and Jiang–Huai (Lower Yangtze) subgroups.[64][65]\nOf Yuan's four Mandarin subgroups, the Northwestern dialects are the most diverse, particularly in the province of Shanxi.[39] The linguist Li Rong proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese entering tone (plosive-final) category should constitute a separate top-level group called Jin.[66] He used this classification in the *Language Atlas of China* (1987).[13] Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group, pointing out that the Lower Yangtze dialects also retain the glottal stop.[67][68]\n\n\nThe southern boundary of the Mandarin area, with the central Wu, Gan and Xiang groups, is weakly defined due to centuries of diffusion of northern features. Many border varieties have a mixture of features that make them difficult to classify.\nThe boundary between Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang is particularly weak,[69] and in many early classifications the two were not separated.[70] Zhou Zhenhe and You Rujie include the New Xiang dialects within Southwestern Mandarin, treating only the more conservative Old Xiang dialects as a separate group.[71]\nThe Huizhou dialects have features of both Mandarin and Wu, and have been assigned to one or other of these groups or treated as separate by various authors. Li Rong and the *Language Atlas of China* treated it as a separate top-level group, but this remains controversial.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Subgroups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus Jin Chinese, which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the *Language Atlas of China* (1987)[74]\nThe *Language Atlas of China* calls the remainder of Mandarin a \"supergroup\", divided into eight dialect groups distinguished by their treatment of the Middle Chinese entering tone (see Tones below):[75][c]\n\n\n\n* Northeastern Mandarin (98 million), spoken in northeast China except the Liaodong Peninsula.[77] This dialect is closely related to Standard Chinese, with little variation in lexicon and very few tonal differences.\n* Beijing Mandarin (27 million), spoken in Beijing and environs such as Chengde and northern Hebei, as well as some areas of recent large-scale immigration, such as northern Xinjiang.[78] The Beijing dialect forms the basis of Standard Chinese. This classification is controversial, as a number of researchers view Beijing and Northeastern Mandarin as a single dialect group.[79]\n* Jilu Mandarin (89 million), spoken in Hebei (\"Ji\") and Shandong (\"Lu\") provinces except the Shandong Peninsula, as well as in few counties of Heilongjiang, due to migration. Includes Tianjin dialect.[80] Tones and vocabulary are markedly different. In general, there is substantial intelligibility with Beijing Mandarin.\n* Jiaoliao Mandarin (35 million), spoken in Shandong (Jiaodong) and Liaodong Peninsulas, as well as in few counties of Heilongjiang, due to migration.[81] Very noticeable tonal changes, different in \"flavour\" from Ji–Lu Mandarin, but with more variance. There is moderate intelligibility with Beijing.\n* Central Plains Mandarin (186 million), spoken in Henan province, the central parts of Shaanxi in the Yellow River valley, eastern Gansu, as well as southern Xinjiang, due to recent migration.[82] There are significant phonological differences, with partial intelligibility with Beijing. The Dungan language spoken in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan belongs to this group. Dungan speakers such as the poet Iasyr Shivaza have reported being understood by speakers of the Beijing dialect, but not vice versa.[83]\n* Lanyin Mandarin (17 million), spoken in central and western Gansu province (with capital Lanzhou) and Ningxia autonomous region (with capital Yinchuan), as well as northern Xinjiang.[84]\n* Lower Yangtze Mandarin (or Jiang–Huai, 86 million), spoken in the parts of Jiangsu and Anhui on the north bank of the Yangtze, as well as some areas on the south bank, such as Nanjing in Jiangsu, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, etc.[85] There are significant phonological and lexical changes to varying degrees, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited. Lower Yangtze Mandarin has been significantly influenced by Wu Chinese.\n* Southwestern Mandarin (260 million), spoken in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and the Mandarin-speaking areas of Hunan, Guangxi and southern Shaanxi.[86] There are sharp phonological, lexical, and tonal changes, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited to varying degrees.[45][46]\n\n\nThe *Atlas* also includes several unclassified Mandarin dialects spoken in scattered pockets across southeastern China, such as Nanping in Fujian and Dongfang on Hainan.[87]\nAnother Mandarin variety of uncertain classification is apparently Gyami, recorded in the 19th century in the Tibetan foothills, who the Chinese apparently did not recognize as Chinese.[88]\nSome northwestern Mandarin varieties in the Qinghai–Gansu sprachbund have undergone drastic changes in phonology, lexicon and grammar.[89]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Standard Chinese phonology\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In the traditional analysis, the medial, vowel and coda are combined as a *final*.[90]\nNot all combinations occur. For example, Standard Chinese (based on the Beijing dialect) has about 1,200 distinct syllables.[91]\n\n\nPhonological features that are generally shared by the Mandarin dialects include:\n\n\n\n* the palatalization of velar consonants and alveolar sibilants when they occur before palatal glides;\n* one syllable contains maximum four phonemes (maximum three vowels and no consonant cluster)\n* the disappearance of final stop consonants and /-m/ (although in many Lower Yangtze Mandarin and Jin Chinese dialects, an echo of the final stops is preserved as a glottal stop);\n* the presence of retroflex consonants (although these are absent in many Southwestern and Northeastern Mandarin dialects);\n* the historical devoicing of stops and sibilants (also common to most non-Mandarin varieties).\n\n\n### Initials[edit]\n\n\nThe maximal inventory of initials of a Mandarin dialect is as follows, with bracketed pinyin spellings given for those present in the standard language:[92]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Labial | Apical | Retroflex | Palatal | Velar |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasals | /m/ ⟨m⟩ | /n/ ⟨n⟩ |  |  | /ŋ/ |\n| Stops | /p/ ⟨b⟩ | /t/ ⟨d⟩ |  |  | /k/ ⟨g⟩ |\n| /pʰ/ ⟨p⟩ | /tʰ/ ⟨t⟩ |  |  | /kʰ/ ⟨k⟩ |\n| Affricates |  | /t͡s/ ⟨z⟩ | /ʈ͡ʂ/ ⟨zh⟩ | /t͡ɕ/ ⟨j⟩ |  |\n|  | /t͡sʰ/ ⟨c⟩ | /ʈ͡ʂʰ/ ⟨ch⟩ | /t͡ɕʰ/ ⟨q⟩ |  |\n| Fricatives | /f/ ⟨f⟩ | /s/ ⟨s⟩ | /ʂ/ ⟨sh⟩ | /ɕ/ ⟨x⟩ | /x/ ⟨h⟩ |\n| Sonorants | /w/ ⟨w⟩ | /l/ ⟨l⟩ | /ɻ/ ~ /ʐ/ ⟨r⟩ | /j/ ⟨y⟩ |  |\n\n\n* Most Mandarin-speaking areas distinguish between the retroflex initials /ʈʂ ʈʂʰ ʂ/ from the apical sibilants /ts tsʰ s/, though they often have a different distribution than in the standard language. In most dialects of the southeast and southwest the retroflex initials have merged with the alveolar sibilants, so that *zhi* becomes *zi*, *chi* becomes *ci*, and *shi* becomes *si*.[93]\n* The alveolo-palatal sibilants /tɕ tɕʰ ɕ/ are the result of merger between the historical palatalized velars /kj kʰj xj/ and palatalized alveolar sibilants /tsj tsʰj sj/.[93] In about 20% of dialects, the alveolar sibilants did not palatalize, remaining separate from the alveolo-palatal initials. (The unique pronunciation used in Peking opera falls into this category.) On the other side, in some dialects of eastern Shandong, the velar initials did not undergo palatalization.\n* Many southwestern Mandarin dialects mix /f/ and /xw/, substituting one for the other in some or all cases.[94] For example, *fei* /fei/ \"to fly\" and *hui* /xwei/ \"grey\" may be merged in these areas.\n* In some dialects, initial /l/ and /n/ are not distinguished. In Southwestern Mandarin, these sounds usually merge to /n/; in Lower Yangtze Mandarin, they usually merge to /l/.[94]\n* People in many Mandarin-speaking areas may use different initial sounds where Beijing uses initial *r-* /ɻ/. Common variants include /j/, /l/, /n/ and /w/.[93]\n* Some dialects have initial /ŋ/ corresponding to the zero initial of the standard language.[93] This initial is the result of a merger of the Middle Chinese zero initial with /ŋ/ and /ʔ/.\n* Many dialects of Northwestern and Central Plains Mandarin have /pf pfʰ f v/ where Beijing has /tʂw tʂʰw ʂw ɻw/.[93] Examples include /pfu/ \"pig\" for standard *zhū* 豬 /tʂu/, /fei/ \"water\" for standard *shuǐ* 水 /ʂwei/, /vã/ \"soft\" for standard *ruǎn* 軟 /ɻwan/.\n\n\n### Finals[edit]\n\n\nMost Mandarin dialects have three medial glides, /j/, /w/ and /ɥ/ (spelled *i*, *u* and *ü* in pinyin), though their incidence varies.\nThe medial /w/, is lost after apical initials in several areas.[93]\nThus Southwestern Mandarin has /tei/ \"correct\" where the standard language has *dui* /twei/.\nSouthwestern Mandarin also has /kai kʰai xai/ in some words where the standard has *jie qie xie* /tɕjɛ tɕʰjɛ ɕjɛ/. This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin, since it is so easily noticeable. E.g. *hai* \"shoe\" for standard *xie*, *gai* \"street\" for standard *jie*.\n\n\nMandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels. Syllabic fricatives, as in standard *zi* and *zhi*, are common in Mandarin dialects, though they also occur elsewhere.[95]\nThe Middle Chinese off-glides /j/ and /w/ are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects, yielding several diphthongs and triphthongs in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups (and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects).[95]\n\n\nThe Middle Chinese coda /m/ was still present in Old Mandarin, but has merged with /n/ in the modern dialects.[93] In some areas (especially the southwest) final /ŋ/ has also merged with /n/. This is especially prevalent in the rhyme pairs *-en/-eng* /ən əŋ/ and *-in/-ing* /in iŋ/. As a result, *jīn* \"gold\" and *jīng* \"capital\" merge in those dialects.\n\n\nThe Middle Chinese final stops have undergone a variety of developments in different Mandarin dialects (see Tones below). In Lower Yangtze dialects and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final glottal stop. In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.[93] As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Character | Meaning | Standard(Beijing) | Beijing, HarbinColloquial | Jinan(Ji–Lu) | Xi'an(Central Plains) | Chengdu(Southwestern) | Yangzhou(Lower Yangtze) | Middle ChineseReconstructed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pinyin | IPA\n |\n| 课 | 'lesson' | *kè* | kʰɤ | kʰɤ | kʰə | kʰwo | kʰo | kʰo | kʰɑ |\n| 客 | 'guest' | tɕʰie[d] | kʰei | kʰei | kʰe | kʰəʔ | kʰɰak |\n| 果 | 'fruit' | *guǒ* | kwo | kwo | kwə | kwo | ko | ko | kwɑ |\n| 国 | 'country' | *guó* | kwei | kwe | kɔʔ | kwək |\n\n\nR-coloring, a characteristic feature of Mandarin, works quite differently in the southwest. Whereas Beijing dialect generally removes only a final /j/ or /n/ when adding the rhotic final *-r* /ɻ/, in the southwest the *-r* replaces nearly the entire rhyme.\n\n\n\n### Tones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe syllable *ma* with each of the primary tones in Standard Chinese\n\nIn general, no two Mandarin-speaking areas have exactly the same set of tone values, but most Mandarin-speaking areas have very similar tone *distribution*. For example, the dialects of Jinan, Chengdu, Xi'an and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the Beijing dialect tones of [˥] (55), [˧˥] (35), [˨˩˦] (214), and [˥˩] (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.[96]\n\n\nMiddle Chinese stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.[39]\nOf the four tones of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.[97]\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin *d* denotes a non-aspirate /t/, while *t* denotes an aspirate /tʰ/):\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexes of Middle Chinese initials and tones in modern Mandarin\n| Middle Chinese tone\n | \"level tone\"(平; *píng*)\n | \"rising tone\"(上; *shǎng*)\n | \"departing tone\"(去; *qù*)\n |\n| Example\n | 丹 | 灘 | 蘭 | 彈 | 亶 | 坦 | 懶 | 但 | 旦 | 炭 | 爛 | 彈 |\n| Middle Chinese\n | tan | tʰan | lan | dan\n | tan | tʰan | lan | dan\n | tan | tʰan | lan | dan\n |\n| Standard Chinese\n | *dān* | *tān* | *lán* | *tán* | *dǎn* | *tǎn* | *lǎn* | *dàn* | *tàn* | *làn* | *dàn* |\n| Modern Mandarin tone\n | 1 (*yīnpíng*)\n | 2 (*yángpíng*)\n | 3 (*shǎng*)\n | 4 (*qù*)\n |\n\n\nIn traditional Chinese phonology, syllables that ended in a stop in Middle Chinese (i.e. /p/, /t/ or /k/) were considered to belong to a special category known as the \"entering tone\".\nThese final stops have disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, with the syllables distributed over the other four modern tones in different ways in the various Mandarin subgroups.\n\n\nIn the Beijing dialect that underlies the standard language, syllables beginning with original voiceless consonants were redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern.[98] For example, the three characters 積脊跡, all *tsjek* in Middle Chinese (William H. Baxter's transcription), are now pronounced *jī*, *jǐ* and *jì* respectively. Older dictionaries such as *Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary* mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. Minjiang) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a glottal stop /ʔ/.[98] (This includes the dialect of Nanjing on which the Postal Romanization was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing *h*.) This development is shared with Wu Chinese and is thought to represent the pronunciation of Old Mandarin. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four. However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no phonemic tone at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexes of the Middle Chinese entering tone in Mandarin dialects[99]\n| subgroup\n | Middle Chinese initial\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| voiceless\n | voiced sonorant | voiced obstruent\n |\n| Beijing\n | 1,3,4\n | 4\n | 2\n |\n| Northeastern\n |\n| Jiao–Liao\n | 3\n |\n| Ji–Lu\n | 1\n |\n| Central Plains\n | 1\n |\n| Lan–Yin\n | 4\n |\n| Southwestern\n | 2\n |\n| Lower Yangtze\n | marked with final glottal stop (*rù*)\n |\n\n\nAlthough the system of tones is common across Mandarin dialects, their realization as tone contours varies widely:[100]\n\n\n\n\n\nPhonetic realization of Mandarin tones in principal dialects\n| Tone name\n | 1 (*yīnpíng*)\n | 2 (*yángpíng*)\n | 3 (*shǎng*)\n | 4 (*qù*)\n | marked withglottal stop (*rù*)\n |\n| Beijing\n | Beijing | ˥ (55)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˨˩˦ (214)\n | ˥˩ (51)\n |\n| Northeastern\n | Harbin | ˦ (44)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n | ˥˨ (52)\n |\n| Jiao–Liao\n | Yantai | ˧˩ (31)\n | (˥ (55))\n | ˨˩˦ (214)\n | ˥ (55)\n |\n| Ji–Lu\n | Tianjin | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˩˩˧ (113)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n |\n| Shijiazhuang | ˨˧ (23)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˥ (55)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n |\n| Central Plains\n | Zhengzhou | ˨˦ (24)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˧˩˨ (312)\n |\n| Luoyang | ˧˦ (34)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˥˦ (54)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n |\n| Xi'an | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˦ (44)\n |\n| Tianshui | ˩˧ (13)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˦ (44)\n |\n| Lan–Yin\n | Lanzhou | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˧ (33)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n |\n| Yinchuan | ˦ (44)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˩˧ (13)\n |\n| Southwestern\n | Chengdu | ˦ (44)\n | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n |\n| Xichang | ˧ (33)\n | ˥˨ (52)\n | ˦˥ (45)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n | ˧˩ʔ (31)\n |\n| Kunming | ˦ (44)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˨˩˨ (212)\n |\n| Wuhan | ˥ (55)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n |\n| Liuzhou | ˦ (44)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n |\n| Lower Yangtze\n | Yangzhou | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˥ (55)\n | ˥ʔ (5)\n |\n| Nantong | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˥ (55)\n | ˦˨ (42), ˨˩˧ (213)\\*\n | ˦ʔ (4), ˥ʔ (5)\\*\n |\n\n\n\\* Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones, due to influence from the neighbouring Wu dialects.\n\n\nMandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.[98]\n\n\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except Shanghainese[*citation needed*]. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more homophones. New words have been formed by adding affixes such as *lao-* (老), *-zi* (子), *-(e)r* (儿/兒), and *-tou* (头/頭), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in *cōngmáng* (匆忙), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun reduplication, which is hardly used in Beijing. In Sichuan, one hears *bāobāo* (包包) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses *bāor* (包儿).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as *húdié* (蝴蝶) 'butterfly'.\n\n\nThe singular pronouns in Mandarin are *wǒ* (我) 'I', *nǐ* (你 or 妳) 'you', *nín* (您) 'you (formal)', and *tā* (他, 她 or 它/牠) 'he, 'she', 'it', with -*men* (们/們) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun *zánmen* (咱们/咱們), which is inclusive of the listener, and *wǒmen* (我们/我們), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns. While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., Shanghainese has *non* 侬/儂 'you' and *yi* 伊 'he', 'she').[101]\n\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as *hútòng* (胡同) \"alley\". Southern Chinese varieties have borrowed from Tai,[102] Austroasiatic,[103] and Austronesian languages.\n\n\nThere are also many Chinese words which come from foreign languages such as *gāo'ěrfū* (高尔夫) from \"golf\"; *bǐjīní* (比基尼) from \"bikini\", and *hànbǎo bāo* (汉堡包) from \"hamburger\".\n\n\nIn general, the greatest variation occurs in slang, in kinship terms, in names for common crops and domesticated animals, for common verbs and adjectives, and other such everyday terms. The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary—terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinese grammar\n\nChinese varieties of all periods are considered prime examples of analytic languages, relying on word order and particles instead of inflection or affixes to provide grammatical information such as person, number, tense, mood, or case.\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.[104]\n\n\nThe basic word order of subject–verb–object is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of ditransitive sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n\n\n\n我\n\nwǒ\n\nI\n给\n\ngěi\n\ngive\n你\n\nnǐ\n\nyou\n一本\n\nyìběn\n\na\n书\n\nshū\n\nbook\n[我給你一本書]\n我 给 你 一本 书\n\nwǒ gěi nǐ yìběn shū\n\nI give you a book\n\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.[105][106]\n\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate aspect, but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle *le* (了) to indicate the perfective aspect and *zhe* (着; 著) for the progressive aspect.\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese *zo2* (咗) and *gan2* (紧; 緊) respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle *guo* (过; 過) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.[107]\n\n\nThe subordinative particle *de* (的) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.[108]\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a classifier fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.[109]\n\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final particles alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle *ma* (嘛), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by *yo* (喲; 哟) in southern usage.\n\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches.

As reported by a native speaker of the Zhenjiang dialect (a Jianghuai (Lower Yangtze) Mandarin dialect spoken in the Jiangsu province), it is impossible for her to understand the Nantong dialect (another Jianghuai Mandarin dialect spoken around 140 kilometers away in the same province).\"[47]\n3. **^** Speaker numbers are rounded to the nearest million from figures in the revised edition of the *Language Atlas of China*.[76]\n4. **^** The development is purely due to the preservation of an early glide which later became /j/ and triggered palatalization, and does not indicate the absence of a vowel merger.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mandarin at *Ethnologue* (22nd ed., 2019) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** 台灣手語簡介 (Taiwan shouyu jianjie) (2009)\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Norman (1988), p. 136.\n4. **^** \"Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language (Order of the President No.37)\".

'officials' speech') is a group of Sinitic dialects that are natively spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. The group includes the Beijing dialect, the basis of the phonology of Standard Chinese, the official language of China. Because Mandarin originated in North China and most Mandarin dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as **Northern Chinese** (simplified Chinese: 北方话; traditional Chinese: 北方話; pinyin: *Běifānghuà*; lit. 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such as those of the Southwest (including Sichuanese) and the Lower Yangtze, are not mutually intelligible with the standard language (or are only partially intelligible). Nevertheless, Mandarin as a group is often placed first in lists of languages by number of native speakers (with nearly one billion).\n\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the Chinese dialect groups; it is spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area that stretches from Yunnan in the southwest to Xinjiang in the northwest and Heilongjiang in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the North China Plain compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four tones. The final stops of Middle Chinese have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final glottal stop. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain retroflex initial consonants, which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese.\n\n\nThe Chinese capital has been within the Mandarin-speaking area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a lingua franca for government officials and the courts since the 14th century.[3] By the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the national language. Standard Mandarin Chinese is the official language of the People's Republic of China[4] and Taiwan,[5] as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is also used as one of the official languages of the United Nations.[6] Recent increased migration from Mandarin-speaking regions of China and Taiwan has now resulted in the language being one of the more frequently used varieties of Chinese among Chinese diaspora communities. It is also the most commonly taught Chinese variety.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe English word \"mandarin\" (from Portuguese *mandarim*, from Malay *menteri*, from Sanskrit *mantrī*, *mantrin*, meaning 'minister or counsellor') originally meant an official of the Ming and Qing empires.[7][8][a]\nSince their native varieties were often mutually unintelligible, these officials communicated using a koiné language based on various northern varieties. When Jesuit missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name *Guānhuà* (官话; 官話; 'language of the officials').[10]\n\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to Standard Chinese, which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Mandarin Chinese is based on Beijing dialect, with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan (Republic of China, ROC), as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore, and a high-prestige minority language[11] in Malaysia. It also functions as the language of instruction in mainland China and Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\n\n\n\n* *Pǔtōnghuà* (普通话; 普通話; 'common speech') in mainland China,\n* *Guóyǔ* (国语; 國語; 'national language')) in Taiwan or\n* *Huáyǔ* (华语; 華語; 'Huaxia language') in Malaysia and Singapore,\n\n\nbut not as *Guānhuà*.[3]\n\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call *Guānhuà*'. The alternative term *Běifānghuà* (北方话; 北方話; 'Northern dialects'), is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name—for example the Sichuan dialect and the Hebei dialect or Northeastern dialect, all being regarded as distinct from the standard language, with which they may not share much mutual intelligibility.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Chinese language\n\nThe hundreds of modern local varieties of Chinese developed from regional variants of Old Chinese and Middle Chinese. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are Wu, Gan, and Xiang in central China and Min, Hakka, and Yue on the southeast coast.[12] The *Language Atlas of China* (1987) distinguishes three further groups: Jin (split from Mandarin), Huizhou in the Huizhou region of Anhui and Zhejiang, and Pinghua in Guangxi and Yunnan.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Old Mandarin[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Old Mandarin\n\n![](image)A page of the *Menggu Ziyun*, covering the syllables *tsim* to *lim*\nAfter the fall of the Northern Song (959–1126) and during the reign of the Jin (1115–1234) and Yuan (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common form of speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the *qu* and *sanqu* poetry.[15]\n\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a rime dictionary called the *Zhongyuan Yinyun* (1324). A radical departure from the rime table tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the 'Phags-pa script based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the *Menggu Ziyun*, a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.[16]\n\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial stops and affricates showed a three-way contrast between tenuis, voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were four tones, with the fourth or \"entering tone\", a checked tone comprising syllables ending in plosives (*-p*, *-t* or *-k*). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch and by the late Tang dynasty, each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.[17]\n\n\nThe *Zhongyuan Yinyun* shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final *-m*, which has merged with *-n* in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered *j-*, *q-* and *x-* in pinyin).[18]\n\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun *tā* (他), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.[19]\n\n\n\n### Vernacular literature[edit]\n\n\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in Literary Chinese, which was modeled on the classics of the Warring States period and the Han dynasty. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, 翼 (*yì*; 'wing') is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 homophones in Standard Chinese.\n\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for documents that were meant to be performed or recited, such as plays or stories. From at least the Yuan dynasty plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as *Water Margin*, on down to the Qing dynasty novel *Dream of the Red Chamber* and beyond, there developed a literature in written vernacular Chinese (白话; 白話; *báihuà*). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.[20]\n\n\nHu Shih, a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled \"A History of Vernacular Literature\" (*Báihuà Wénxuéshǐ*).\n\n\n\n### Late imperial koiné[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)\n\n![](image)*Zhongguo Guanhua* (中國官話), or *Medii Regni Communis Loquela* (\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by Étienne Fourmont (with Arcadio Huang) in 1742[21]\n\n> The Chinese have different languages in different provinces, to such an extent that they cannot understand each other.... [They] also have another language which is like a universal and common language; this is the official language of the mandarins and of the court; it is among them like Latin among ourselves.... Two of our fathers [Michele Ruggieri and Matteo Ricci] have been learning this mandarin language...  \n>  — Alessandro Valignano, *Historia del principio y progresso de la Compañía de Jesús en las Indias Orientales*, I:28 (1542–1564)[22]\n> \n\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, most Chinese people living in many parts of South China spoke only their local variety. As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as *Guānhuà*. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.[3]\n\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the Yongzheng Emperor, unable to understand the accents of officials from Guangdong and Fujian, issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation (正音書院; *Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn*) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n\n\n\n* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for *v-*\n* merger of *-m* finals with *-n*\n* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in \"entering tone\" syllables\n* retention of the distinction between palatalized velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings \"Peking\" and \"Tientsin\" for modern \"Beijing\" and \"Tianjin\".[23]\n\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a koiné based on dialects spoken in the Nanjing area, though not identical to any single dialect.[24] This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to Beijing in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard. As late as 1815, Robert Morrison based the first English–Chinese dictionary on this koiné as the standard of the time, though he conceded that the Beijing dialect was gaining in influence.[25] By the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.[26]\n\n\n\n### Standard Mandarin Chinese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Standard Chinese\n\nThe variant of Mandarin as spoken by educated classes in Beijing was made the official language of China by the Qing dynasty in the early 1900s and the successive Republican government. In the early years of the Republic of China, intellectuals of the New Culture Movement, such as Hu Shih and Chen Duxiu, successfully campaigned for the replacement of Literary Chinese as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on northern dialects. A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language (traditional Chinese: 國語; simplified Chinese: 国语; pinyin: *Guóyǔ*; Wade–Giles: *Kuo²-yü³*). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the National Language Unification Commission finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it *pǔtōnghuà* (simplified Chinese: 普通话; traditional Chinese: 普通話; lit. 'common speech').[27] Some 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984. Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.[28]\n\n\nThis standard language is now used in education, the media, and formal occasions in both mainland China and Taiwan, as well as among the Chinese community of Singapore.[29][30] However in other parts of the Chinese-speaking world, namely Hong Kong and Macau, the standard form of Chinese used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local Cantonese because of their colonial and linguistic history.[31] While Standard Mandarin is now the medium of instruction in schools throughout China, it still has yet to gain traction as a common language among the local population in areas where Mandarin dialects are not native.[32] In these regions, people may be either diglossic or speak the standard language with a notable accent.[33] However since the start of the 21st century, there has been an effort of mass education in Standard Mandarin Chinese and discouragement of local language usage by the Chinese government in order to erase these regional differences.[34]\n\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. The codified forms of both *Pǔtōnghuà* and *Guóyǔ* base their phonology on the Beijing accent, and also take some elements from other sources, and deviate from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and pragmatics.[35] Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the Beijing dialect.[36]\n\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although simplified characters are used in mainland China and Singapore, while traditional characters remain in use in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.[37] Singapore has followed mainland China in officially adopting simplified characters.[38]\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nMandarin is spoken across northern and southwestern China, with some pockets in neighbouring countries.\nUnlike their compatriots on the southeast coast, few Mandarin speakers engaged in overseas emigration until the late 20th century, but there are now significant communities of them in cities across the world.[39]\n\n\n\n### Mainland China[edit]\n\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The North China Plain provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in Fujian.[40][41]\n\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar,[42] and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.[b]\n\n\nMost of northeast China, except for Liaoning, did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,[48] and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from the Beijing dialect.[49] The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern Xinjiang, where Xibe, a modern dialect, is spoken.[50]\n\n\nThe frontier areas of northwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time, and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area.[49] The Southwest was settled early, but the population fell dramatically for obscure reasons in the 13th century, and did not recover until the 17th century.[49] The dialects in this area are now relatively uniform.[39] However, long-established cities even very close to Beijing, such as Tianjin, Baoding, Shenyang, and Dalian, have markedly different dialects.\n\n\n\n### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Taiwanese Mandarin\n\nStandard Mandarin is the official language of Taiwan. The Taiwanese standard of Mandarin differs very little from that of mainland China, with differences largely in some technical vocabulary developed from the 1950s onwards.[51]\n\n\nWhile the spoken standard of Taiwanese Mandarin is nearly identical to that of mainland China, the colloquial form has been heavily influenced by other local languages, especially Taiwanese Hokkien. Notable differences include: the merger of retroflex sounds (zh, ch, sh, r) with the alveolar series (z, c, s), frequent mergers of the \"neutral tone\" with a word's original tone, and absence of erhua.[52] Code-switching between Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien is common, as the majority of the population continues to also speak the latter as a native language.[53]\n\n\n\n### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n#### Singapore[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singaporean Mandarin\n\nMandarin is one of the four official languages of Singapore along with English, Malay, and Tamil. Historically, it was seldom used by the Chinese Singaporean community, which primarily spoke the Southern Chinese languages of Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, or Hakka.[54] The launch of the Speak Mandarin Campaign in 1979 by the government prioritized the language over traditional vernaculars in an attempt to create a common ethnic language and foster closer connections to China.[55] This has led to a significant increase and presence of Mandarin usage in the country, coupled with a strong decline in usage of other Chinese variants.\n\n\nStandard Singaporean Mandarin is nearly identical to the standards of China and Taiwan, with minor vocabulary differences. It is the Mandarin variant used in education, media, and official settings. Meanwhile, a colloquial form called Singdarin is used in informal daily life and is heavily influenced in terms of both grammar and vocabulary by local languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, and Malay. Instances of code-switching with English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay, or a combination of any of these is also common.\n\n\n\n#### Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Malaysian Mandarin\n\nIn Malaysia, Mandarin has been adopted by local Chinese-language schools as the medium of instruction with the standard based on that of Singapore. However, it is not as widespread in daily life among the Malaysian Chinese community, as Hokkien speakers continue to form a plurality among the ethnic Chinese population and Cantonese serves as the common language (especially in commerce and local media).[56] An exception is in the state of Johor, where Mandarin is increasingly used alongside Cantonese as a lingua franca in part due to Singaporean influence.[57] As in Singapore, the local colloquial variant of Mandarin exhibits influences from Cantonese and Malay.\n\n\n\n#### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese people in Myanmar\n\nIn northern Myanmar, a Southwestern Mandarin variant close to the Yunnanese dialect is spoken by local Chinese and other ethnic groups. In some rebel group-controlled regions, Mandarin also serves as the lingua franca.[58]\n\n\n\n### Central Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dungan language\n\nThe Dungan people of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are descendents of Hui people who fled to the Russian Empire from Dzungaria in 1877 after the fall of Kashgaria to Qing forces and from the Ili valley after it was ceded to China in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1881.[59]\nThey speak two dialects, descended from Mandarin dialects of Gansu and Shaanxi, and write their language in the Cyrillic script.[60]\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\n### Boundaries[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of varieties of Chinese\n\nThe classification of Chinese dialects evolved during the 20th century, and many points remain unsettled. Early classifications tended to follow provincial boundaries or major geographical features.[61]\n\n\nIn 1936, Wang Li produced the first classification based on phonetic criteria, principally the evolution of Middle Chinese voiced initials. His Mandarin group included dialects of northern and southwestern China, as well as those of Hunan and northern Jiangxi.[62]\nLi Fang-Kuei's classification of 1937 distinguished the latter two groups as Xiang and Gan, while splitting the remaining Mandarin dialects between Northern, Lower Yangtze and Southwestern Mandarin groups.[63]\n\n\nThe widely accepted seven-group classification of Yuan Jiahua in 1960 kept Xiang and Gan separate, with Mandarin divided into Northern, Northwestern, Southwestern and Jiang–Huai (Lower Yangtze) subgroups.[64][65]\nOf Yuan's four Mandarin subgroups, the Northwestern dialects are the most diverse, particularly in the province of Shanxi.[39] The linguist Li Rong proposed that the northwestern dialects of Shanxi and neighbouring areas that retain a final glottal stop in the Middle Chinese entering tone (plosive-final) category should constitute a separate top-level group called Jin.[66] He used this classification in the *Language Atlas of China* (1987).[13] Many other linguists continue to include these dialects in the Mandarin group, pointing out that the Lower Yangtze dialects also retain the glottal stop.[67][68]\n\n\nThe southern boundary of the Mandarin area, with the central Wu, Gan and Xiang groups, is weakly defined due to centuries of diffusion of northern features. Many border varieties have a mixture of features that make them difficult to classify.\nThe boundary between Southwestern Mandarin and Xiang is particularly weak,[69] and in many early classifications the two were not separated.[70] Zhou Zhenhe and You Rujie include the New Xiang dialects within Southwestern Mandarin, treating only the more conservative Old Xiang dialects as a separate group.[71]\nThe Huizhou dialects have features of both Mandarin and Wu, and have been assigned to one or other of these groups or treated as separate by various authors. Li Rong and the *Language Atlas of China* treated it as a separate top-level group, but this remains controversial.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Subgroups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus Jin Chinese, which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the *Language Atlas of China* (1987)[74]\nThe *Language Atlas of China* calls the remainder of Mandarin a \"supergroup\", divided into eight dialect groups distinguished by their treatment of the Middle Chinese entering tone (see Tones below):[75][c]\n\n\n\n* Northeastern Mandarin (98 million), spoken in northeast China except the Liaodong Peninsula.[77] This dialect is closely related to Standard Chinese, with little variation in lexicon and very few tonal differences.\n* Beijing Mandarin (27 million), spoken in Beijing and environs such as Chengde and northern Hebei, as well as some areas of recent large-scale immigration, such as northern Xinjiang.[78] The Beijing dialect forms the basis of Standard Chinese. This classification is controversial, as a number of researchers view Beijing and Northeastern Mandarin as a single dialect group.[79]\n* Jilu Mandarin (89 million), spoken in Hebei (\"Ji\") and Shandong (\"Lu\") provinces except the Shandong Peninsula, as well as in few counties of Heilongjiang, due to migration. Includes Tianjin dialect.[80] Tones and vocabulary are markedly different. In general, there is substantial intelligibility with Beijing Mandarin.\n* Jiaoliao Mandarin (35 million), spoken in Shandong (Jiaodong) and Liaodong Peninsulas, as well as in few counties of Heilongjiang, due to migration.[81] Very noticeable tonal changes, different in \"flavour\" from Ji–Lu Mandarin, but with more variance. There is moderate intelligibility with Beijing.\n* Central Plains Mandarin (186 million), spoken in Henan province, the central parts of Shaanxi in the Yellow River valley, eastern Gansu, as well as southern Xinjiang, due to recent migration.[82] There are significant phonological differences, with partial intelligibility with Beijing. The Dungan language spoken in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan belongs to this group. Dungan speakers such as the poet Iasyr Shivaza have reported being understood by speakers of the Beijing dialect, but not vice versa.[83]\n* Lanyin Mandarin (17 million), spoken in central and western Gansu province (with capital Lanzhou) and Ningxia autonomous region (with capital Yinchuan), as well as northern Xinjiang.[84]\n* Lower Yangtze Mandarin (or Jiang–Huai, 86 million), spoken in the parts of Jiangsu and Anhui on the north bank of the Yangtze, as well as some areas on the south bank, such as Nanjing in Jiangsu, Jiujiang in Jiangxi, etc.[85] There are significant phonological and lexical changes to varying degrees, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited. Lower Yangtze Mandarin has been significantly influenced by Wu Chinese.\n* Southwestern Mandarin (260 million), spoken in the provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and the Mandarin-speaking areas of Hunan, Guangxi and southern Shaanxi.[86] There are sharp phonological, lexical, and tonal changes, and intelligibility with Beijing is limited to varying degrees.[45][46]\n\n\nThe *Atlas* also includes several unclassified Mandarin dialects spoken in scattered pockets across southeastern China, such as Nanping in Fujian and Dongfang on Hainan.[87]\nAnother Mandarin variety of uncertain classification is apparently Gyami, recorded in the 19th century in the Tibetan foothills, who the Chinese apparently did not recognize as Chinese.[88]\nSome northwestern Mandarin varieties in the Qinghai–Gansu sprachbund have undergone drastic changes in phonology, lexicon and grammar.[89]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Standard Chinese phonology\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

For example, Standard Chinese (based on the Beijing dialect) has about 1,200 distinct syllables.[91]\n\n\nPhonological features that are generally shared by the Mandarin dialects include:\n\n\n\n* the palatalization of velar consonants and alveolar sibilants when they occur before palatal glides;\n* one syllable contains maximum four phonemes (maximum three vowels and no consonant cluster)\n* the disappearance of final stop consonants and /-m/ (although in many Lower Yangtze Mandarin and Jin Chinese dialects, an echo of the final stops is preserved as a glottal stop);\n* the presence of retroflex consonants (although these are absent in many Southwestern and Northeastern Mandarin dialects);\n* the historical devoicing of stops and sibilants (also common to most non-Mandarin varieties).\n\n\n### Initials[edit]\n\n\nThe maximal inventory of initials of a Mandarin dialect is as follows, with bracketed pinyin spellings given for those present in the standard language:[92]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Labial | Apical | Retroflex | Palatal | Velar |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasals | /m/ ⟨m⟩ | /n/ ⟨n⟩ |  |  | /ŋ/ |\n| Stops | /p/ ⟨b⟩ | /t/ ⟨d⟩ |  |  | /k/ ⟨g⟩ |\n| /pʰ/ ⟨p⟩ | /tʰ/ ⟨t⟩ |  |  | /kʰ/ ⟨k⟩ |\n| Affricates |  | /t͡s/ ⟨z⟩ | /ʈ͡ʂ/ ⟨zh⟩ | /t͡ɕ/ ⟨j⟩ |  |\n|  | /t͡sʰ/ ⟨c⟩ | /ʈ͡ʂʰ/ ⟨ch⟩ | /t͡ɕʰ/ ⟨q⟩ |  |\n| Fricatives | /f/ ⟨f⟩ | /s/ ⟨s⟩ | /ʂ/ ⟨sh⟩ | /ɕ/ ⟨x⟩ | /x/ ⟨h⟩ |\n| Sonorants | /w/ ⟨w⟩ | /l/ ⟨l⟩ | /ɻ/ ~ /ʐ/ ⟨r⟩ | /j/ ⟨y⟩ |  |\n\n\n* Most Mandarin-speaking areas distinguish between the retroflex initials /ʈʂ ʈʂʰ ʂ/ from the apical sibilants /ts tsʰ s/, though they often have a different distribution than in the standard language. In most dialects of the southeast and southwest the retroflex initials have merged with the alveolar sibilants, so that *zhi* becomes *zi*, *chi* becomes *ci*, and *shi* becomes *si*.[93]\n* The alveolo-palatal sibilants /tɕ tɕʰ ɕ/ are the result of merger between the historical palatalized velars /kj kʰj xj/ and palatalized alveolar sibilants /tsj tsʰj sj/.[93] In about 20% of dialects, the alveolar sibilants did not palatalize, remaining separate from the alveolo-palatal initials. (The unique pronunciation used in Peking opera falls into this category.) On the other side, in some dialects of eastern Shandong, the velar initials did not undergo palatalization.\n* Many southwestern Mandarin dialects mix /f/ and /xw/, substituting one for the other in some or all cases.[94] For example, *fei* /fei/ \"to fly\" and *hui* /xwei/ \"grey\" may be merged in these areas.\n* In some dialects, initial /l/ and /n/ are not distinguished. In Southwestern Mandarin, these sounds usually merge to /n/; in Lower Yangtze Mandarin, they usually merge to /l/.[94]\n* People in many Mandarin-speaking areas may use different initial sounds where Beijing uses initial *r-* /ɻ/. Common variants include /j/, /l/, /n/ and /w/.[93]\n* Some dialects have initial /ŋ/ corresponding to the zero initial of the standard language.[93] This initial is the result of a merger of the Middle Chinese zero initial with /ŋ/ and /ʔ/.\n* Many dialects of Northwestern and Central Plains Mandarin have /pf pfʰ f v/ where Beijing has /tʂw tʂʰw ʂw ɻw/.[93] Examples include /pfu/ \"pig\" for standard *zhū* 豬 /tʂu/, /fei/ \"water\" for standard *shuǐ* 水 /ʂwei/, /vã/ \"soft\" for standard *ruǎn* 軟 /ɻwan/.\n\n\n### Finals[edit]\n\n\nMost Mandarin dialects have three medial glides, /j/, /w/ and /ɥ/ (spelled *i*, *u* and *ü* in pinyin), though their incidence varies.\nThe medial /w/, is lost after apical initials in several areas.[93]\nThus Southwestern Mandarin has /tei/ \"correct\" where the standard language has *dui* /twei/.\nSouthwestern Mandarin also has /kai kʰai xai/ in some words where the standard has *jie qie xie* /tɕjɛ tɕʰjɛ ɕjɛ/. This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin, since it is so easily noticeable. E.g. *hai* \"shoe\" for standard *xie*, *gai* \"street\" for standard *jie*.\n\n\nMandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels. Syllabic fricatives, as in standard *zi* and *zhi*, are common in Mandarin dialects, though they also occur elsewhere.[95]\nThe Middle Chinese off-glides /j/ and /w/ are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects, yielding several diphthongs and triphthongs in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups (and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects).[95]\n\n\nThe Middle Chinese coda /m/ was still present in Old Mandarin, but has merged with /n/ in the modern dialects.[93] In some areas (especially the southwest) final /ŋ/ has also merged with /n/. This is especially prevalent in the rhyme pairs *-en/-eng* /ən əŋ/ and *-in/-ing* /in iŋ/. As a result, *jīn* \"gold\" and *jīng* \"capital\" merge in those dialects.\n\n\nThe Middle Chinese final stops have undergone a variety of developments in different Mandarin dialects (see Tones below). In Lower Yangtze dialects and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final glottal stop. In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.[93] As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Character | Meaning | Standard(Beijing) | Beijing, HarbinColloquial | Jinan(Ji–Lu) | Xi'an(Central Plains) | Chengdu(Southwestern) | Yangzhou(Lower Yangtze) | Middle ChineseReconstructed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pinyin | IPA\n |\n| 课 | 'lesson' | *kè* | kʰɤ | kʰɤ | kʰə | kʰwo | kʰo | kʰo | kʰɑ |\n| 客 | 'guest' | tɕʰie[d] | kʰei | kʰei | kʰe | kʰəʔ | kʰɰak |\n| 果 | 'fruit' | *guǒ* | kwo | kwo | kwə | kwo | ko | ko | kwɑ |\n| 国 | 'country' | *guó* | kwei | kwe | kɔʔ | kwək |\n\n\nR-coloring, a characteristic feature of Mandarin, works quite differently in the southwest. Whereas Beijing dialect generally removes only a final /j/ or /n/ when adding the rhotic final *-r* /ɻ/, in the southwest the *-r* replaces nearly the entire rhyme.\n\n\n\n### Tones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe syllable *ma* with each of the primary tones in Standard Chinese\n\nIn general, no two Mandarin-speaking areas have exactly the same set of tone values, but most Mandarin-speaking areas have very similar tone *distribution*. For example, the dialects of Jinan, Chengdu, Xi'an and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the Beijing dialect tones of [˥] (55), [˧˥] (35), [˨˩˦] (214), and [˥˩] (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.[96]\n\n\nMiddle Chinese stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.[39]\nOf the four tones of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.[97]\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin *d* denotes a non-aspirate /t/, while *t* denotes an aspirate /tʰ/):\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexes of Middle Chinese initials and tones in modern Mandarin\n| Middle Chinese tone\n | \"level tone\"(平; *píng*)\n | \"rising tone\"(上; *shǎng*)\n | \"departing tone\"(去; *qù*)\n |\n| Example\n | 丹 | 灘 | 蘭 | 彈 | 亶 | 坦 | 懶 | 但 | 旦 | 炭 | 爛 | 彈 |\n| Middle Chinese\n | tan | tʰan | lan | dan\n | tan | tʰan | lan | dan\n | tan | tʰan | lan | dan\n |\n| Standard Chinese\n | *dān* | *tān* | *lán* | *tán* | *dǎn* | *tǎn* | *lǎn* | *dàn* | *tàn* | *làn* | *dàn* |\n| Modern Mandarin tone\n | 1 (*yīnpíng*)\n | 2 (*yángpíng*)\n | 3 (*shǎng*)\n | 4 (*qù*)\n |\n\n\nIn traditional Chinese phonology, syllables that ended in a stop in Middle Chinese (i.e. /p/, /t/ or /k/) were considered to belong to a special category known as the \"entering tone\".\nThese final stops have disappeared in most Mandarin dialects, with the syllables distributed over the other four modern tones in different ways in the various Mandarin subgroups.\n\n\nIn the Beijing dialect that underlies the standard language, syllables beginning with original voiceless consonants were redistributed across the four tones in a completely random pattern.[98] For example, the three characters 積脊跡, all *tsjek* in Middle Chinese (William H. Baxter's transcription), are now pronounced *jī*, *jǐ* and *jì* respectively. Older dictionaries such as *Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary* mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. Minjiang) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a glottal stop /ʔ/.[98] (This includes the dialect of Nanjing on which the Postal Romanization was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing *h*.) This development is shared with Wu Chinese and is thought to represent the pronunciation of Old Mandarin. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four. However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no phonemic tone at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflexes of the Middle Chinese entering tone in Mandarin dialects[99]\n| subgroup\n | Middle Chinese initial\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| voiceless\n | voiced sonorant | voiced obstruent\n |\n| Beijing\n | 1,3,4\n | 4\n | 2\n |\n| Northeastern\n |\n| Jiao–Liao\n | 3\n |\n| Ji–Lu\n | 1\n |\n| Central Plains\n | 1\n |\n| Lan–Yin\n | 4\n |\n| Southwestern\n | 2\n |\n| Lower Yangtze\n | marked with final glottal stop (*rù*)\n |\n\n\nAlthough the system of tones is common across Mandarin dialects, their realization as tone contours varies widely:[100]\n\n\n\n\n\nPhonetic realization of Mandarin tones in principal dialects\n| Tone name\n | 1 (*yīnpíng*)\n | 2 (*yángpíng*)\n | 3 (*shǎng*)\n | 4 (*qù*)\n | marked withglottal stop (*rù*)\n |\n| Beijing\n | Beijing | ˥ (55)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˨˩˦ (214)\n | ˥˩ (51)\n |\n| Northeastern\n | Harbin | ˦ (44)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n | ˥˨ (52)\n |\n| Jiao–Liao\n | Yantai | ˧˩ (31)\n | (˥ (55))\n | ˨˩˦ (214)\n | ˥ (55)\n |\n| Ji–Lu\n | Tianjin | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˩˩˧ (113)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n |\n| Shijiazhuang | ˨˧ (23)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˥ (55)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n |\n| Central Plains\n | Zhengzhou | ˨˦ (24)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˧˩˨ (312)\n |\n| Luoyang | ˧˦ (34)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˥˦ (54)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n |\n| Xi'an | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˦ (44)\n |\n| Tianshui | ˩˧ (13)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˦ (44)\n |\n| Lan–Yin\n | Lanzhou | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˧ (33)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n |\n| Yinchuan | ˦ (44)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˩˧ (13)\n |\n| Southwestern\n | Chengdu | ˦ (44)\n | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n |\n| Xichang | ˧ (33)\n | ˥˨ (52)\n | ˦˥ (45)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n | ˧˩ʔ (31)\n |\n| Kunming | ˦ (44)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˨˩˨ (212)\n |\n| Wuhan | ˥ (55)\n | ˨˩˧ (213)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n |\n| Liuzhou | ˦ (44)\n | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˥˧ (53)\n | ˨˦ (24)\n |\n| Lower Yangtze\n | Yangzhou | ˧˩ (31)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˦˨ (42)\n | ˥ (55)\n | ˥ʔ (5)\n |\n| Nantong | ˨˩ (21)\n | ˧˥ (35)\n | ˥ (55)\n | ˦˨ (42), ˨˩˧ (213)\\*\n | ˦ʔ (4), ˥ʔ (5)\\*\n |\n\n\n\\* Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones, due to influence from the neighbouring Wu dialects.\n\n\nMandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.[98]\n\n\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except Shanghainese[*citation needed*]. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more homophones. New words have been formed by adding affixes such as *lao-* (老), *-zi* (子), *-(e)r* (儿/兒), and *-tou* (头/頭), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in *cōngmáng* (匆忙), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun reduplication, which is hardly used in Beijing. In Sichuan, one hears *bāobāo* (包包) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses *bāor* (包儿).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as *húdié* (蝴蝶) 'butterfly'.\n\n\nThe singular pronouns in Mandarin are *wǒ* (我) 'I', *nǐ* (你 or 妳) 'you', *nín* (您) 'you (formal)', and *tā* (他, 她 or 它/牠) 'he, 'she', 'it', with -*men* (们/們) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun *zánmen* (咱们/咱們), which is inclusive of the listener, and *wǒmen* (我们/我們), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns. While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., Shanghainese has *non* 侬/儂 'you' and *yi* 伊 'he', 'she').[101]\n\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as *hútòng* (胡同) \"alley\". Southern Chinese varieties have borrowed from Tai,[102] Austroasiatic,[103] and Austronesian languages.\n\n\nThere are also many Chinese words which come from foreign languages such as *gāo'ěrfū* (高尔夫) from \"golf\"; *bǐjīní* (比基尼) from \"bikini\", and *hànbǎo bāo* (汉堡包) from \"hamburger\".\n\n\nIn general, the greatest variation occurs in slang, in kinship terms, in names for common crops and domesticated animals, for common verbs and adjectives, and other such everyday terms. The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary—terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinese grammar\n\nChinese varieties of all periods are considered prime examples of analytic languages, relying on word order and particles instead of inflection or affixes to provide grammatical information such as person, number, tense, mood, or case.\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.[104]\n\n\nThe basic word order of subject–verb–object is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of ditransitive sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n\n\n\n我\n\nwǒ\n\nI\n给\n\ngěi\n\ngive\n你\n\nnǐ\n\nyou\n一本\n\nyìběn\n\na\n书\n\nshū\n\nbook\n[我給你一本書]\n我 给 你 一本 书\n\nwǒ gěi nǐ yìběn shū\n\nI give you a book\n\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.[105][106]\n\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate aspect, but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle *le* (了) to indicate the perfective aspect and *zhe* (着; 著) for the progressive aspect.\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese *zo2* (咗) and *gan2* (紧; 緊) respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle *guo* (过; 過) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.[107]\n\n\nThe subordinative particle *de* (的) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.[108]\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a classifier fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.[109]\n\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final particles alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle *ma* (嘛), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by *yo* (喲; 哟) in southern usage.\n\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches. In Mandarin the character 師 has the same function, it is combined with 教, which means 'teach', to form the word 'teacher'.\n\n\nList of several common Chinese prefixes and suffixes:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Affix\n | Pronunciation\n | Gloss\n | Example\n | Example gloss\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 们; 們 | *men* | plural for human nouns, same as -s, -es\n | 学生们; 學生們, 朋友们; 朋友們 | 'students', 'friends'\n |\n| 可 | *kě* | same as -able\n | 可信, 可笑, 可靠 | 'trusty', 'laughable', 'reliable'\n |\n| 重 | *chóng* | same as re- (again)\n | 重做, 重建, 重新 | 'redo', 'rebuild', 'renew'\n |\n| 第 | *dì* | same as -th, -st, -nd\n | 第二, 第一 | 'second', 'first'\n |\n| 老 | *lǎo* | old, or show respect to a certain type of person\n | 老头; 老頭, 老板; 老闆, 老师; 老師 | 'old man', 'boss', 'teacher'\n |\n| 化 | *huà* | same as -ize, -en\n | 公式化、制度化、強化 | 'officialize', 'systemize', 'strengthen'\n |\n| 家 | *jiā* | same as -er or expert\n | 作家、科學家 [科学家]、藝術家 [艺术家] | 'writer', 'scientist', 'artist'\n |\n| 性 | *xìng* | same as -ness, -ability\n | 可靠性、實用性 [实用性]、可理解性 | 'reliability', 'usability', 'understand-ability'\n |\n| 鬼 | *guǐ* | usually used in a disparaging way, similar to -aholic\n | 煙鬼、酒鬼、膽小鬼 [胆小鬼] | 'smoker', 'alcoholic', 'coward'\n |\n| 匠 | *jiàng* | a technician in a certain field\n | 花匠, 油漆匠, 木匠 | 'gardener', 'painter', 'carpenter\n |\n| 迷 | *mí* | an enthusiast\n | 戏迷; 戲迷, 球迷, 歌迷 | 'theater fan', 'sports fan', 'groupie (of a musician)'\n |\n| 师; 師 | *shī* | suffix for occupations\n | 教师; 教師 厨师; 廚師, 律师]; 律師 | 'teacher', 'chef', 'lawyer'\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Language portal\n\n\n* Chinese dictionary\n* Transcription into Chinese characters\n* Written Chinese\n* Languages of China\n* List of varieties of Chinese\n* *Linguistic Atlas of Chinese Dialects*\n* List of languages by number of native speakers\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** A folk etymology deriving the name from *Mǎn dà rén* (满大人; 滿大人; 'Manchu big man') is without foundation.[9]\n2. **^** For example:\n\n\t* In the early 1950s, only 54% of people in the Mandarin-speaking area could understand Standard Chinese, which was based on the Beijing dialect.[43]\n\t* \"Hence we see that even Mandarin includes within it an unspecified number of languages, very few of which have ever been reduced to writing, that are mutually unintelligible.\"[44]\n\t* \"the common term assigned by linguists to this group of languages implies a certain homogeneity which is more likely to be related to the sociopolitical context than to linguistic reality, since most of those varieties are not mutually intelligible.\"[45]\n\t* \"A speaker of only standard Mandarin might take a week or two to comprehend even simple Kunminghua with ease—and then only if willing to learn it.\"[46]\n\t* \"without prior exposure, speakers of different Mandarin dialects often have considerable difficulty understanding each other's local vernacular even if they come from the same province, provided that two or more distinct groups of Mandarin are spoken therein.

Today, it is a global language with about 486 million native speakers, mainly in the Americas and Spain.[1] Spanish is the official language of 20 countries. It is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese;[5][6] the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); and the world's most widely spoken Romance language. The country with the largest population of native speakers is Mexico.[7]\n\n\nSpanish is part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century,[8] and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo, a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Spanish colonialism in the early modern period spurred on the introduction of the language to overseas locations, most notably to the Americas.[9]\n\n\nAs a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin, and has one of the smaller degrees of difference from it (about 20%) alongside Sardinian and Italian.[10] Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin, including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek.[11][12] Alongside English and French, it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world.[13] Spanish does not feature prominently as a scientific language; however, it is better represented in areas like humanities and social sciences.[14] Spanish is also the third most used language on internet websites after English and Chinese.[15]\n\n\nSpanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and it is also used as an official language by the European Union, Organization of American States, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, African Union and many other international organizations.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Name of the language and etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names given to the Spanish language\n\n### Name of the language[edit]\n\n\nIn Spain and in some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called not only *español* but also *castellano* (Castilian), the language from the Kingdom of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician, Basque, Asturian, Catalan, Aragonese and Occitan.\n\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term *castellano* to define the official language of the whole of Spain, in contrast to *las demás lenguas españolas* (lit. \"the other Spanish languages\"). Article III reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> *El castellano es la lengua española oficial del Estado. ... Las demás lenguas españolas serán también oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Autónomas...*  \n> \n> Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State. ... The other Spanish languages shall also be official in their respective Autonomous Communities...\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Most used term *castellano* or *español*\nThe Royal Spanish Academy (*Real Academia Española*), on the other hand, currently uses the term *español* in its publications. However, from 1713 to 1923, it called the language *castellano*.\n\n\nThe *Diccionario panhispánico de dudas* (a language guide published by the Royal Spanish Academy) states that, although the Royal Spanish Academy prefers to use the term *español* in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms—*español* and *castellano*—are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.[17]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe term *castellano* is related to Castile (*Castilla* or archaically *Castiella*), the kingdom where the language was originally spoken. The name of Castile, in turn, is usually assumed to be derived from *castillo* ('castle').\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the language spoken in Castile was generically referred to as *Romance* and later also as *Lengua vulgar*.[18] Later in the period, it gained geographical specification as *Romance castellano* (\"romanz castellano\", \"romanz de Castiella\"), \"lenguaje de Castiella\", and ultimately simply as *castellano* (noun).[18]\n\n\nDifferent etymologies have been suggested for the term *español* (Spanish). According to the Royal Spanish Academy, *español* derives from the Occitan word *espaignol* and that, in turn, derives from the Vulgar Latin \\**hispaniolus* ('of Hispania').[19] Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal suggested that the classic *hispanus* or *hispanicus* took the suffix *-one* from Vulgar Latin, as happened with other words such as *bretón* (Breton) or *sajón* (Saxon).\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Spanish language\n\n![](image)The Visigothic Cartularies of Valpuesta, written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Royal Spanish Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the Glosas Emilianenses.[20]\nLike the other Romance languages, the Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC. Several pre-Roman languages (also called Paleohispanic languages)—some distantly related to Latin as Indo-European languages, and some that are not related at all—were previously spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included Proto-Basque, Iberian, Lusitanian, Celtiberian and Gallaecian.\n\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era, the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring Romance languages—Mozarabic (Andalusi Romance), Navarro-Aragonese, Leonese, Catalan, Portuguese, Galician, Occitan, and later, French and Italian. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from Arabic, as well as a minor influence from the Germanic Gothic language through the migration of tribes and a period of Visigoth rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both Classical Latin and Renaissance Latin, the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\n\nAccording to the theories of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, local sociolects of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of Burgos, and this dialect was later brought to the city of Toledo, where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.[21] In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, Leonese, and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see Iberian Romance languages). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the *Reconquista*, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al-Andalus, much of it indirectly, through the Romance Mozarabic dialects (some 4,000 Arabic-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).[22] The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of Toledo, in the 13th to 16th centuries, and Madrid, from the 1570s.[21]\n\n\nThe development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages, including lenition of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin *vīta* > Spanish *vida*). The diphthongization of Latin stressed short e and o—which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese—is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish | Ladino | Aragonese | Asturian | Galician | Portuguese | Catalan | Gascon / Occitan | French | Sardinian | Italian | Romanian | English\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| petra | *p**ie**dra* | *pedra* | *pedra*, *pèira* | *p**ie**rre* | *pedra*, *perda* | *p**ie**tra* | *p**ia**trǎ* | 'stone'\n |\n| terra | *t**ie**rra* | *terra* | *tèrra* | *terre* | *terra* | *țară* | 'land'\n |\n| moritur | *m**ue**re* | *m**ue**rre* | *morre* | *mor* | *morís* | *m**eu**rt* | *mòrit* | *m**uo**re* | *m**oa**re* | 'dies (v.)'\n |\n| mortem | *m**ue**rte* | *morte* | *mort* | *mòrt* | *mort* | *morte, morti* | *morte* | *m**oa**rte* | 'death'\n |\n\n![](image)Chronological map showing linguistic evolution in southwest Europe\nSpanish is marked by palatalization of the Latin double consonants (geminates) nn and ll (thus Latin\n*annum* > Spanish *año*, and Latin *anellum* > Spanish\n*anillo*).\n\n\nThe consonant written *u* or *v* in Latin and pronounced [w] in Classical Latin had probably \"fortified\" to a bilabial fricative /β/ in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written *b* (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic *b* and *v*.\n\n\nTypical of Spanish (as also of neighboring Gascon extending as far north as the Gironde estuary, and found in a small area of Calabria), attributed by some scholars to a Basque substratum was the mutation of Latin initial *f* into *h-* whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The *h-*, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects, it is still aspirated in some words. Because of borrowings from Latin and neighboring Romance languages, there are many *f*-/*h*- doublets in modern Spanish: *Fernando* and *Hernando* (both Spanish for \"Ferdinand\"), *ferrero* and *herrero* (both Spanish for \"smith\"), *fierro* and *hierro* (both Spanish for \"iron\"), and *fondo* and *hondo* (both words pertaining to depth in Spanish, though *fondo* means \"bottom\", while *hondo* means \"deep\"); additionally, *hacer* (\"to make\") is cognate to the root word of *satisfacer* (\"to satisfy\"), and *hecho* (\"made\") is similarly cognate to the root word of *satisfecho* (\"satisfied\").\n\n\nCompare the examples in the following table:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish | Ladino | Aragonese | Asturian | Galician | Portuguese | Catalan | Gascon / Occitan | French | Sardinian | Italian | Romanian | English\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| filium | ***h**ijo* | *fijo* (or *hijo*) | *fillo* | *fíu* | *fillo* | *filho* | *fill* | *filh*, ***h**ilh* | *fils* | *fizu, fìgiu, fillu* | *figlio* | *fiu* | 'son'\n |\n| facere | ***h**acer* | *fazer* | *fer* | *facer* | *fazer* | *fer* | *far*, *faire*, ***h**ar* (or ***h**èr*) | *faire* | *fàghere, fàere, *fàiri** | *fare* | *a face* | 'to do'\n |\n| febrem | *fiebre* *(calentura)* | *febre* | *fèbre*, *frèbe*, ***h**rèbe* (or***h**erèbe*) | *fièvre* | *calentura* | *febbre* | *febră* | 'fever'\n |\n| focum | *fuego* | *fueu* | *fogo* | *foc* | *fuòc*, *fòc*, ***h**uèc* | *feu* | *fogu* | *fuoco* | *foc* | 'fire'\n |\n\nSome consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages, as shown in the examples in the following table:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish | Ladino | Aragonese | Asturian | Galician | Portuguese | Catalan | Gascon / Occitan | French | Sardinian | Italian | Romanian | English\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **cl**āvem | ***ll**ave* | *clave* | *clau* | ***ll**ave* | *chave* | *chave* | *clau* | *clé* | *giae, crae,* *crai* | *chiave* | *cheie* | 'key'\n |\n| **fl**amma | ***ll**ama* | ***fl**ama* | *chama* | *chama*, *flama* | *flama* | *flamme* | *framma* | *fiamma* | *flamă* | 'flame'\n |\n| **pl**ēnum | ***ll**eno* | *pleno* | *plen* | ***ll**enu* | *cheo* | *cheio*, *pleno* | *ple* | *plen* | *plein* | *prenu* | *pieno* | *plin* | 'plenty, full'\n |\n| o**ct**ō | *o**ch**o* | *güeito* | *o**ch**o*, *oito* | *oito* | *oito* (*oi**t**o*) | *vuit*, *huit* | *uè**ch***, *uò**ch***, *uèit* | *huit* | *oto* | *otto* | *opt* | 'eight'\n |\n| mu**lt**um | *mu**ch**o**mu**y*** | *mu**nch**o**mu**y*** | *muito**mu**i*** | *mu**nch**u**mu**i*** | *moito**mo**i*** | *muito* | *molt* | *molt* (arch.) | *très,*\n*beaucoup,* *moult*\n | *meda* | *molto* | *mult* | 'much,very,many'\n |\n\n![](image)Antonio de Nebrija, author of *Gramática de la lengua castellana*, the first grammar of a modern European language[23]\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants, known in Spanish as the *reajuste de las sibilantes*, which resulted in the distinctive velar [x] pronunciation of the letter ⟨j⟩ and—in a large part of Spain—the characteristic interdental [θ] (\"th-sound\") for the letter ⟨z⟩ (and for ⟨c⟩ before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩). See History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants) for details.\n\n\nThe *Gramática de la lengua castellana*, written in Salamanca in 1492 by Elio Antonio de Nebrija, was the first grammar written for a modern European language.[24] According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I, she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire.[25] In his introduction to the grammar, dated 18 August 1492, Nebrija wrote that \"... language was always the companion of empire.\"[26]\n\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, the language was taken to the Spanish-discovered America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America. Miguel de Cervantes, author of *Don Quixote*, is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called *la lengua de Cervantes* (\"the language of Cervantes\").[27]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara, and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as Spanish Harlem in New York City.

As of 2023, it is estimated that about 486 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it the second most spoken language by number of native speakers.[1] An additional 75 million speak Spanish as a second or foreign language, making it the fourth most spoken language in the world overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi with a total number of 538 million speakers.[29] Spanish is also the third most used language on the Internet, after English and Chinese.[30]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peninsular Spanish\n\n![](image)Percentage of people who self reportedly know enough Spanish to hold a conversation, in the EU, 2005 Native country\n More than 8.99%\n Between 4% and 8.99%\n Between 1% and 3.99%\n Less than 1%\n\nSpanish is the official language of Spain, the country after which it is named and from which it originated. Other European territories in which it is also widely spoken include Gibraltar and Andorra.[31]\n\n\nSpanish is also spoken by immigrant communities in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany.[32] Spanish is an official language of the European Union.\n\n\n\n### Americas[edit]\n\n\n#### Hispanic America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish language in the Americas\n\nToday, the majority of the Spanish speakers live in Hispanic America. Nationally, Spanish is the official language—either *de facto* or *de jure*—of Argentina, Bolivia (co-official with 36 indigenous languages), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (co-official with 63 indigenous languages), Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay (co-official with Guaraní),[33] Peru (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, and \"the other indigenous languages\"),[34] Puerto Rico (co-official with English),[35] Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish language in the United States\n\nSee also: New Mexican Spanish and Isleño Spanish\n\n![](image)Percentage of the U.S. population aged 5 and over who speaks Spanish at home in 2019, by states\nAccording to the 2020 census, over 60 million people of the U.S. population were of Hispanic or Hispanic American by origin.[36] In turn, 41.8 million people in the United States aged five or older speak Spanish at home, or about 13% of the population.[37] The Spanish language has a long history of presence in the United States due to early Spanish and, later, Mexican administration over territories now forming the southwestern states, also Louisiana ruled by Spain from 1762 to 1802, as well as Florida, which was Spanish territory until 1821, and Puerto Rico which was Spanish until 1898.\n\n\nSpanish is by far the most common second language in the country, with over 50 million total speakers if non-native or second-language speakers are included.[38] While English is the de facto national language of the country, Spanish is often used in public services and notices at the federal and state levels. Spanish is also used in administration in the state of New Mexico.[39] The language has a strong influence in major metropolitan areas such as those of Los Angeles, Miami, San Antonio, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Tucson and Phoenix of the Arizona Sun Corridor, as well as more recently, Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, Raleigh and Baltimore-Washington, D.C. due to 20th- and 21st-century immigration.\n\n\n\n#### Rest of the Americas[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize (known until 1973 as British Honduras) where English is the sole official language, according to the 2010 census it was then spoken natively by 45% of the population and 56.6% of the total population were able to speak the language.[40]\n\n\nDue to their proximity to Spanish-speaking countries and small existing native Spanish speaking minority, Trinidad and Tobago has implemented Spanish language teaching into its education system. The Trinidad government launched the *Spanish as a First Foreign Language* (SAFFL) initiative in March 2005.[41]\n\n\nIn addition to sharing most of its borders with Spanish-speaking countries, the creation of Mercosur in the early 1990s induced a favorable situation for the promotion of Spanish language teaching in Brazil.[42][43] In 2005, the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill, signed into law by the President, making it mandatory for schools to offer Spanish as an alternative foreign language course in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil.[44] In September 2016 this law was revoked by Michel Temer after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff.[45] In many border towns and villages along Paraguay and Uruguay, a mixed language known as Portuñol is spoken.[46]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n#### Sub-Saharan Africa[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Equatoguinean Spanish\n\n![](image)Spanish language signage in Malabo, capital city of Equatorial Guinea\nEquatorial Guinea is the only Spanish-speaking country located entirely in Africa, with the language introduced during the Spanish colonial period.[47] Enshrined in the constitution as an official language (alongside French and Portuguese), Spanish features prominently in the Equatoguinean education system and is the primary language used in government and business.[48] Whereas it is not the mother tongue of virtually any of its speakers, the vast majority of the population is proficient in Spanish.[49] The Instituto Cervantes estimates that 87.7% of the population is fluent in Spanish.[50] This figure highlights Equatorial Guinea as having a higher proportion of proficient speakers of a colonial language relative to the respective metropolitan languages in other West and Central African nations.[51]\n\n\nSpanish is spoken by very small communities in Angola due to Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned for their country's independence.[52]\n\n\n\n#### North Africa and Macaronesia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Canarian Spanish and Saharan Spanish\n\nSpanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in Africa, namely the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean some 100 km (62 mi) off the northwest of the African mainland. The Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands, traces its origins back to the Castilian conquest in the 15th century, and, in addition to a resemblance to Western Andalusian speech patterns, it also features strong influence from the Spanish varieties spoken in the Americas,[53] which in turn have also been influenced historically by Canarian Spanish.[54]\n\n\nWhile far from the heyday of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, there are some presence of the Spanish language in the north of Morocco, stemming for example from the availability of certain Spanish-language media.[55] Many northern Moroccans have rudimentary knowledge of Spanish.[55] Spanish has also presence in the education system of the country (either by means of selected education centers running the Spain's education system, primarily located in the North, and the availability of Spanish as foreign language subject in secondary education).[55]\n\n\nIn Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, a primarily Hassaniya Arabic-speaking territory, Spanish was officially spoken as the language of the colonial administration during the late 19th and 20th centuries. Today, Spanish is present in the partially-recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria), where the Spanish language is still taught as a second language, largely by Cuban educators.[56][57][58] The number of Spanish speakers is unknown.[*failed verification*][59][60]\n\n\nSpanish is also an official language of the African Union.\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chavacano, Philippine Spanish, and Spanish language in the Philippines\n\n![](image)Spanish language newspaper in the Philippines from 1892\nSpanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish administration in 1565 to a constitutional change in 1973. During Spanish colonization, it was the language of government, trade, and education, and was spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos (*Ilustrados*). Despite a public education system set up by the colonial government, by the end of Spanish rule in 1898, only about 10% of the population had knowledge of Spanish, mostly those of Spanish descent or elite standing.[61]\n\n\nSpanish continued to be official and used in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American administration after the Spanish–American War but was eventually replaced by English as the primary language of administration and education by the 1920s.[62] Nevertheless, despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers, Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines upon independence in 1946, alongside English and Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog.\n\n\nSpanish was briefly removed from official status in 1973 but reimplemented under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos two months later.[63] It remained an official language until the ratification of the present constitution in 1987, in which it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.[64] In recent years changing attitudes among non-Spanish speaking Filipinos have helped spur a revival of the language,[65][66] and starting in 2009 Spanish was reintroduced as part of the basic education curriculum in a number of public high schools, becoming the largest foreign language program offered by the public school system,[67] with over 7,000 students studying the language in the 2021–2022 school year alone.[68] The local business process outsourcing industry has also helped boost the language's economic prospects.[69] Today, while the actual number of proficient Spanish speakers is around 400,000, or under 0.5% of the population,[70] a new generation of Spanish speakers in the Philippines has likewise emerged, though speaker estimates vary widely.[71]\n\n\nAside from standard Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language called Chavacano developed in the southern Philippines. However, it is not mutually intelligible with Spanish.[72] The number of Chavacano-speakers was estimated at 1.2 million in 1996.[73] The local languages of the Philippines also retain significant Spanish influence, with many words derived from Mexican Spanish, owing to the administration of the islands by Spain through New Spain until 1821, until direct governance from Madrid afterwards to 1898.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Announcement in Spanish on Easter Island, welcoming visitors to Rapa Nui National Park\nSpanish is the official and most spoken language on Easter Island, which is geographically part of Polynesia in Oceania and politically part of Chile. However, Easter Island's traditional language is Rapa Nui, an Eastern Polynesian language.\n\n\nAs a legacy of comprising the former Spanish East Indies, Spanish loan words are present in the local languages of Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Marshall Islands and Micronesia.[76][77]\n\n\nIn addition, in Australia and New Zealand, there are native Spanish communities, resulting from emigration from Spanish-speaking countries (mainly from the Southern Cone).[78]\n\n\n\n### Spanish speakers by country[edit]\n\n\n20 countries and one United States territory speak Spanish officially, and the language has a significant unofficial presence in the rest of the United States along with Andorra, Belize and the territory of Gibraltar.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide Spanish fluency (grey and \\* signifies official language)\n| Country\n | Population[79] | Speakers of Spanish as a native language[80] | Native speakers and proficient speakers as a second language[81] | Total number of Spanish speakers (including limited competence speakers)[81][82] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mexico\\*\n | 131,230,255[83] | 123,093,979 (93.8%)[84] | 127,030,887 (96.8%)[2] | 130,180,412 (99.2%)[84] |\n| United States | 333,287,557[85] | 42,032,538 (13.3%)[86] | 42,032,538 (82% of U.S. Hispanics speak Spanish very well (according to a 2011 survey).[87] There are 63.5 million Hispanics in the U.S. as of 2022[88] + 2.8 mill. non Hispanic Spanish speakers[89]) | 57,032,538[2] (42 million as a first language + 15 million as a second language.

Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish grammar\n\n![](image)Miguel de Cervantes, considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of *Don Quixote*, widely considered the first modern European novel\nMost of the grammatical and typological features of Spanish are shared with the other Romance languages. Spanish is a fusional language. The noun and adjective systems exhibit two genders and two numbers. In addition, articles and some pronouns and determiners have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty conjugated forms per verb, with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 verboid forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. The indicative mood is the unmarked one, while the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or indetermination, and is commonly paired with the conditional, which is a mood used to express \"would\" (as in, \"I would eat if I had food); the imperative is a mood to express a command, commonly a one word phrase – \"¡Di!\", \"¡Talk!\".\n\n\nVerbs express T-V distinction by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs.)\n\n\nSpanish syntax is considered right-branching, meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after head words. The language uses prepositions (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case), and usually—though not always—places adjectives after nouns, as do most other Romance languages.\n\n\nSpanish is classified as a subject–verb–object language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by topicalization and focus rather than by syntax. It is a \"pro-drop\", or \"null-subject\" language—that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"verb-framed\" language, meaning that the *direction* of motion is expressed in the verb while the *mode* of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. *subir corriendo* or *salir volando*; the respective English equivalents of these examples—'to run up' and 'to fly out'—show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSpanish as spoken in Spain (by folklorist Fermín Pardo Pardo)\nMain article: Spanish phonology\n\nThe Spanish phonological system evolved from that of Vulgar Latin. Its development exhibits some traits in common with other Western Romance languages, others with the neighboring Hispanic varieties—especially Leonese and Aragonese—as well as other features unique to Spanish. Spanish is alone among its immediate neighbors in having undergone frequent aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial /f/ sound (e.g. Cast. *harina* vs. Leon. and Arag. *farina*).[198] The Latin initial consonant sequences *pl-*, *cl-*, and *fl-* in Spanish typically merge as *ll-* (originally pronounced [ʎ]), while in Aragonese they are preserved in most dialects, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including [tʃ], [ʃ], and [ʎ]. Where Latin had *-li-* before a vowel (e.g. *filius*) or the ending *-iculus*, *-icula* (e.g. *auricula*), Old Spanish produced [ʒ], that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative [x] (*hijo*, *oreja*), whereas neighboring languages have the palatal lateral [ʎ] (e.g. Portuguese *filho*, *orelha*; Catalan *fill*, *orella*).\n\n\n\n### Segmental phonology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Spanish vowel chart, from Ladefoged & Johnson (2010:227)\nThe Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect[199]). The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels /i/ and /u/ to glides—[j] and [w] respectively—when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels /e/ and /o/, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs /je/ and /we/ respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three nasal phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) lateral phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant; (2) three voiceless stops and the affricate /tʃ/; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) voiceless fricatives; (4) a set of voiced obstruents—/b/, /d/, /ɡ/, and sometimes /ʝ/—which alternate between approximant and plosive allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"tapped\" and \"trilled\" *r*-sounds (single ⟨r⟩ and double ⟨rr⟩ in orthography).\n\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, /ʎ/ is marked with an asterisk (\\*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with /ʝ/ in the merger called *yeísmo*. Similarly, /θ/ is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from /s/ (see *seseo*), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\n\nThe phoneme /ʃ/ is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in loanwords. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes /b/, /d/, /ʝ/, and /ɡ/ appears to the right of a *pair* of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the *voiceless* phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the *voiced* ones alternate allophonically (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonant phonemes[200]\n|  | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasal |  | m |  |  | n |  | ɲ |  |\n| Stop | p | b | t | d |  |  | tʃ | ʝ | k | ɡ |\n| Continuant | f | θ\\*\n | s | (ʃ)\n | x |\n| Lateral |  |  |  | l |  | ʎ\\*\n |  |\n| Flap |  |  |  | ɾ |  |  |\n| Trill |  |  |  | r |  |  |\n\n\n### Prosody[edit]\n\n\nSpanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable-timed language: each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.[201][202]\n\n\nSpanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.) and rising tone for yes/no questions.[203][204] There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements and thus, the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation.\n\n\nStress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-to-last or earlier syllables. Stress tends to occur as follows:[205][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n* in words that end with a monophthong, on the penultimate syllable\n* when the word ends in a diphthong, on the final syllable.\n* in words that end with a consonant, on the last syllable, with the exception of two grammatical endings: *-n*, for third-person-plural of verbs, and *-s*, for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs. However, even though a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with *-n* are also stressed on the penult (*joven*, *virgen*, *mitin*), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with *-n* are stressed on their last syllable (*capitán*, *almacén*, *jardín*, *corazón*).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with clitic pronouns attached (e.g. *guardándoselos* 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous minimal pairs that contrast solely on stress such as *sábana* ('sheet') and *sabana* ('savannah'); *límite* ('boundary'), *limite* ('he/she limits') and *limité* ('I limited'); *líquido* ('liquid'), *liquido* ('I sell off') and *liquidó* ('he/she sold off').\n\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is ⟨n⟩, ⟨s⟩, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (See Spanish orthography.)\n\n\n\n## Speaker population[edit]\n\n\nSpanish is the official, or national language in 18 countries and one territory in the Americas, Spain, and Equatorial Guinea. With a population of over 410 million, Hispanophone America accounts for the vast majority of Spanish speakers, of which Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country. In the European Union, Spanish is the mother tongue of 8% of the population, with an additional 7% speaking it as a second language.[206] Additionally, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States and is by far the most popular foreign language among students.[207] In 2015, it was estimated that over 50 million Americans spoke Spanish, about 41 million of whom were native speakers.[208] With continued immigration and increased use of the language domestically in public spheres and media, the number of Spanish speakers in the United States is expected to continue growing over the forthcoming decades.[209]\n\n\n\n## Dialectal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A world map attempting to identify the main dialects of Spanish\nMain article: Spanish dialects and varieties\n\nWhile being mutually intelligible, there are important variations (phonological, grammatical, and lexical) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\n\nThe national variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.[210][211]\n\n\nIn Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. The speech from the educated classes of Madrid is the standard variety for use on radio and television in Spain and it is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.[212] Central (European) Spanish speech patterns have been noted to be in the process of merging with more innovative southern varieties (including Eastern Andalusian and Murcian), as an emerging interdialectal levelled *koine* buffered between the Madrid's traditional national standard and the Seville speech trends.[213]\n\n\n\n### Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Phonetic change \"f → h\" in Spanish\n\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|/θ/]] (\"theta\"), (2) the debuccalization of syllable-final /s/, (3) the sound of the spelled ⟨s⟩, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|/ʎ/]] (\"turned *y*\"),[214]\n\n\n\n* The phoneme /θ/ (spelled *c* before *e* or *i* and spelled ⟨z⟩ elsewhere), a voiceless dental fricative as in English ***th**ing*, is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the Canary Islands, and the Americas), /θ/ does not exist and /s/ occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called *distinción* in Spanish, while the merger is generally called *seseo* (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as [s]) or, occasionally, *ceceo* (referring to its interdental realization, [θ], in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled ⟨c⟩ before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩, and spelled ⟨z⟩ is always pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant.\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as [h], or loss) of syllable-final /s/ is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and *aspiración* in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final /s/ is pronounced as voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant or as a voiceless dental sibilant in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter ⟨s⟩ is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant [s̺] (also described acoustically as \"grave\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of retroflex fricatives. In Andalusia, Canary Islands and most of Hispanic America (except in the Paisa region of Colombia) it is pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant [s], much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English.\n* The phoneme /ʎ/, spelled ⟨ll⟩, a palatal lateral consonant that can be approximated by the sound of the ⟨lli⟩ of English *million*, tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in the highland areas of South America, as well as in Paraguay and lowland Bolivia. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish speakers, it is merged with /ʝ/ (\"curly-tail *j*\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English /j/ (*yod*) as in ***y**acht* and spelled ⟨y⟩ in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled ⟨ll⟩ and the spelled ⟨y⟩ is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called *yeísmo* in Spanish. In Rioplatense Spanish, the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced [ʒ] (as in English *measure* or the French ⟨j⟩) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region (*zheísmo*), or voiceless [ʃ] (as in the French ⟨ch⟩ or Portuguese ⟨x⟩) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo (*sheísmo*).[215]\n\n\n### Morphology[edit]\n\n\nThe main morphological variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns, especially those of the second person and, to a lesser extent, the object pronouns of the third person.\n\n\n\n#### Voseo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Voseo\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Data generated as illustrated by the Association of Spanish Language Academies. The darker the area, the stronger its dominance.\nVirtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second-person singular and thus have two different pronouns meaning \"you\": *usted* in the formal and either *tú* or *vos* in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of *tú* or *vos* varying from one dialect to another. The use of *vos* and its verb forms is called *voseo*. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with *usted*, *tú*, and *vos* denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.[216]\n\n\nIn *voseo*, *vos* is the subject form (*vos decís*, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a preposition (*voy con vos*, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect object forms, and the possessives, are the same as those associated with *tú*: *Vos sabés que tus amigos te respetan* (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\n\nThe verb forms of the general *voseo* are the same as those used with *tú* except in the present tense (indicative and imperative) verbs. The forms for *vos* generally can be derived from those of *vosotros* (the traditional second-person familiar *plural*) by deleting the glide [i̯], or /d/, where it appears in the ending: *vosotros pensá**i**s* > *vos pensás*; *vosotros volvé**i**s* > *vos volvés*, *pensa**d**!* (*vosotros*) > *pensá!* (*vos*), *volve**d**!* (*vosotros*) > *volvé!* (*vos*).[217]\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral voseo (River Plate Spanish)\n| Indicative\n | Subjunctive\n | Imperative\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Present\n | Simple past\n | Imperfect past\n | Future\n | Conditional\n | Present\n | Past\n |\n| *pensás* | ***pensaste*** | ***pensabas*** | ***pensarás*** | ***pensarías*** | ***pienses*** | ***pensaras******pensases*** | *pensá* |\n| *volvés* | ***volviste*** | ***volvías*** | ***volverás*** | ***volverías*** | ***vuelvas*** | ***volvieras******volvieses*** | *volvé* |\n| *dormís* | ***dormiste*** | ***dormías*** | ***dormirás*** | ***dormirías*** | ***duermas*** | ***durmieras******durmieses*** | *dormí* |\n| The forms in ***bold*** coincide with standard ***tú**-conjugation*. |\n\n\nIn Chilean *voseo* on the other hand, almost all verb forms are distinct from their standard *tú*-forms.\n\n\n\n\n\nChilean voseo\n| Indicative\n | Subjunctive\n | Imperative\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Present\n | Simple past\n | Imperfect past\n | Future[218] | Conditional\n | Present\n | Past\n |\n| *pensái(s)* | ***pensaste*** | *pensabais* | *pensarí(s)**pensaráis* | *pensaríai(s)* | *pensí(s)* | *pensarai(s)****pensases*** | ***piensa*** |\n| *volví(s)* | ***volviste*** | *volvíai(s)* | *volverí(s)**volveráis* | *volveríai(s)* | *volvái(s)* | *volvierai(s)****volvieses*** | ***vuelve*** |\n| *dormís* | ***dormiste*** | *dormíais* | *dormirís**dormiráis* | *dormiríais* | *durmáis* | *durmierais****durmieses*** | ***duerme*** |\n| The forms in ***bold*** coincide with standard ***tú**-conjugation*. |\n\n\nThe use of the pronoun *vos* with the verb forms of *tú* (*vos piensas*) is called \"pronominal *voseo*\". Conversely, the use of the verb forms of *vos* with the pronoun *tú* (*tú pensás* or *tú pensái*) is called \"verbal *voseo*\".  \nIn Chile, for example, verbal *voseo* is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun *vos*, which is usually reserved for highly informal situations.\n\n\nIn Central American *voseo*, one can see even further distinction.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral American voseo\n| Indicative\n | Subjunctive\n | Imperative\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Present\n | Simple past\n | Imperfect past\n | Future\n | Conditional\n | Present\n | Past\n |\n| *pensás* | ***pensaste*** | ***pensabas*** | ***pensarás*** | ***pensarías*** | *pensés* | ***pensaras******pensases*** | *pensá* |\n| *volvés* | ***volviste*** | ***volvías*** | ***volverás*** | ***volverías*** | *volvás* | ***volvieras******volvieses*** | *volvé* |\n| *dormís* | ***dormiste*** | ***dormías*** | ***dormirás*** | ***dormirías*** | *durmás* | ***durmieras******durmieses*** | *dormí* |\n| The forms in ***bold*** coincide with standard ***tú**-conjugation*. |\n\n\n##### Distribution in Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas[edit]\n\n\nAlthough *vos* is not used in Spain, it occurs in many Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, with wide differences in social consideration.[219][*better source needed*] Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of *tuteo* (the use of *tú*) in the following areas: almost all of Mexico, the West Indies, Panama, most of Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and coastal Ecuador.\n\n\n*Tuteo* as a cultured form alternates with *voseo* as a popular or rural form in Bolivia, in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that *voseo* can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.[220]\n\n\n*Tuteo* exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar *voseo* in Chile, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and in parts of Guatemala.\n\n\nAreas of generalized *voseo* include Argentina, Nicaragua, eastern Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Quindio and Valle del Cauca.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Ustedes[edit]\n\n\n*Ustedes* functions as formal and informal second-person plural in all of Hispanic America, the Canary Islands, and parts of Andalusia. It agrees with verbs in the 3rd person plural. Most of Spain maintains the formal/familiar distinction with *ustedes* and *vosotros* respectively. The use of *ustedes* with the second person plural is sometimes heard in Andalusia, but it is non-standard.\n\n\n\n#### Usted[edit]\n\n\n*Usted* is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a *familiar* context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of *tú* or *vos*. This usage is sometimes called *ustedeo* in Spanish.\n\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, *usted* is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. *Usted* is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n\n\n#### Third-person object pronouns[edit]\n\n\nMost speakers use (and the *Real Academia Española* prefers) the pronouns *lo* and *la* for *direct* objects (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of animacy, meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and *le* for *indirect* objects (regardless of gender or animacy, meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"*leísmo*\", \"*loísmo*\", or \"*laísmo*\", according to which respective pronoun, *le*, *lo*, or *la*, has expanded beyond the etymological usage (*le* as a direct object, or *lo* or *la* as an indirect object).\n\n\n\n### Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish *mantequilla*, *aguacate* and *albaricoque* (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to *manteca* (word used for lard in Peninsular Spanish), *palta*, and *damasco*, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except *manteca*), Paraguay, Peru (except *manteca* and *damasco*), and Uruguay.\n\n\n\n## Relation to other languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish\n\nSpanish is closely related to the other West Iberian Romance languages, including Asturian, Aragonese, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Mirandese and Portuguese.\n\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.[221][222][223][224] Mutual intelligibility of the *written* Spanish and Portuguese languages is high, lexically and grammatically. *Ethnologue* gives estimates of the lexical similarity between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%, although phonologically the two languages are quite dissimilar. Italian on the other hand, is phonologically similar to Spanish, while sharing lower lexical and grammatical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or between Spanish and Romanian is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.[225][226] Comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\n\nThe Spanish vocabulary has been influenced by several languages: As in other European languages, Classical Greek words (Hellenisms) are abundant in several fields, mainly in Art, Science, Politics, Nature, etc.[227] Its vocabulary has also been influenced by Arabic, having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula, with around 8% of its vocabulary having Arabic lexical roots.[228][229][230][231] It has also been influenced by Basque, Iberian, Celtiberian, Visigothic, and other neighboring Ibero-Romance languages.[232][231] Additionally, it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages, particularly other Romance languages such as French, Latin, Mozarabic, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Occitan, and Sardinian, as well as from Quechua, Nahuatl, and other indigenous languages of the Americas.[233]\n\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish\n | Galician | Portuguese | Astur-Leonese | Aragonese | Catalan | French | Italian | Romanian | English |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| nōs (alterōs)1,2\"we (others)\"\n | ***nosotros*** | ***nós**, **nosoutros***3 | *nós, nós outros*3 | ***nós***, ***nosotros*** | ***nusatros*** | ***nosaltres***(arch. ***nós***)\n | *nous*4 | *noi, noialtri*5 | *noi* | 'we'\n |\n| frātre(m) germānu(m)\"true brother\"\n | ***hermano*** | ***irmán*** | *irmão* | ***hermanu*** | ***chirmán*** | ***germà***(arch. ***frare***)6 | *frère* | *fratello* | *frate* | 'brother'\n |\n| die(m) mārtis (Classical)\"day of Mars\"tertia(m) fēria(m) (Late Latin)\"third (holi)day\"\n | ***Martes*** | ***Martes**, **Terza Feira*** | *Terça-Feira* | ***Martes*** | ***Martes*** | ***Dimarts*** | *Mardi* | *Martedì* | *Marți* | 'Tuesday'\n |\n| cantiōne(m)canticu(m) | ***canción***7(arch. ***cançón***)\n | ***canción**, **cançom***8 | *canção* | ***canción***(also ***canciu***)\n | ***canta*** | ***cançó*** | *chanson* | *canzone* | *cântec* | 'song'\n |\n| magisplūs | ***más***(arch. ***plus***)\n | ***máis*** | *mais* | ***más*** | ***más***(also ***més***)\n | ***més***(arch. ***pus*** or ***plus***)\n | *plus* | *più* | *mai* | 'more'\n |\n| manu(m) sinistra(m) | ***mano izquierda***9(arch. ***mano siniestra***)\n | ***man esquerda***9 | *mão esquerda*9(arch. *mão sẽestra*)\n | ***manu izquierda***9(or ***esquierda***;also ***manzorga***)\n | ***man cucha*** | ***mà esquerra***9(arch. ***mà sinistra***)\n | *main gauche* | *mano sinistra* | *mâna stângă* | 'left hand'\n |\n| rēs, rĕm \"thing\"nūlla(m) rem nāta(m)\"no born thing\"mīca(m) \"crumb\"\n | ***nada*** | ***nada***(also ***ren*** and ***res***)\n | *nada (arch. rés)* | ***nada***(also ***un res***)\n | ***cosa*** | ***res*** | *rien, nul* | *niente, nulla**mica* (negative particle)\n | *nimic, nul* | 'nothing'\n |\n| cāseu(m) fōrmāticu(m)\"form-cheese\"\n | ***queso*** | ***queixo*** | *queijo* | ***quesu*** | ***queso*** | ***formatge*** | *fromage* | *formaggio/cacio* | *caș*10 | 'cheese'\n |\n\n\n1. In Romance etymology, Latin terms are given in the Accusative since most forms derive from this case.  \n\n2. As in \"us very selves\", an emphatic expression.  \n\n3. Also *nós outros* in early modern Portuguese (e.g. *The Lusiads*), and *nosoutros* in Galician.  \n\n4.

Modified with the learned suffix *-ción*.  \n\n8. Depending on the written norm used (see Reintegrationism).  \n\n9. From Basque *esku*, \"hand\" + *erdi*, \"half, incomplete\". This negative meaning also applies for Latin *sinistra(m)* (\"dark, unfortunate\").  \n\n10. Romanian *caș* (from Latin cāsevs) means a type of cheese. The universal term for cheese in Romanian is *brânză* (from unknown etymology).[234]\n\n\n\n\n### Judaeo-Spanish[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Judaeo-Spanish\n\n![](image)The Rashi script, originally used to print Judaeo-Spanish\n![](image)An original letter in Haketia, written in 1832\nJudaeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino,[235] is a variety of Spanish which preserves many features of medieval Spanish and some old Portuguese and is spoken by descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the 15th century.[235] While in Portugal the conversion of Jews occurred earlier and the assimilation of New Christians was overwhelming, in Spain the Jews kept their language and identity. The relationship of Ladino and Spanish is therefore comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively Sephardi Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.[235] Judaeo-Spanish lacks the Native American vocabulary which was acquired by standard Spanish during the Spanish colonial period, and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from Hebrew, French, Greek and Turkish, and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly *olim* (immigrants to Israel) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to assimilation by modern Spanish.\n\n\nA related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too, tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish orthography\n\n\n\n| Spanish language |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)A manuscript of the *Cantar de mio Cid*, 13th century\n |\n| \nOverview |\n| * Pronunciation\n\t+ stress\n* Orthography\n* Names\n |\n| History |\n| * Old\n* Middle\n* Influences\n |\n| Grammar |\n| * Determiners\n* Nouns\n\t+ gender\n* Pronouns\n\t+ personal\n\t+ object\n* Adjectives\n* Prepositions\n* Verbs\n\t+ conjugation\n\t+ irregular verbs\n |\n| Dialects |\n| * Andalusian\n* Andean\n* Argentine\n* Belizean\n* Bolivian\n* Canarian\n* Caribbean\n* Central American\n* Chilean\n* Colombian\n* Costa Rican\n* Cuban\n* Dominican\n* Ecuadorian\n* Equatoguinean\n* Guatemalan\n* Honduran\n* Mexican\n* Murcian\n* New Mexican\n* Nicaraguan\n* Paraguay\n* Panamanian\n* Peninsular\n* Peruvian\n* Philippine\n\t+ status\n* Puerto Rican\n* Rioplatense\n* Saharan\n* Salvadoran\n* Standard\n* Uruguayan\n* Venezuelan\n |\n| Dialectology |\n| * Seseo\n* Yeísmo\n* Voseo\n* Leísmo\n* Loísmo\n |\n| Interlanguages |\n| * Llanito\n* Jopara\n* Judaeo-Spanish\n* Portuñol\n* Spanglish\n* Castrapo\n* Creoles\n* Roquetas Pidgin\n* Chavacano or Chabacano\n* Palenquero or Palenque\n |\n| Teaching |\n| * Hispanism\n* RAE\n* Instituto Cervantes\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nSpanish is written in the Latin script, with the addition of the character ⟨ñ⟩ (*eñe*, representing the phoneme /ɲ/, a letter distinct from ⟨n⟩, although typographically composed of an ⟨n⟩ with a tilde). Formerly the digraphs ⟨ch⟩ (*che*, representing the phoneme /t͡ʃ/) and ⟨ll⟩ (*elle*, representing the phoneme /ʎ/ or /ʝ/), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph ⟨rr⟩ (*erre fuerte*, 'strong r', *erre doble*, 'double r', or simply *erre*), which also represents a distinct phoneme /r/, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨ll⟩ have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with ⟨ch⟩ are now alphabetically sorted between those with ⟨cg⟩ and ⟨ci⟩, instead of following ⟨cz⟩ as they used to. The situation is similar for ⟨ll⟩.[236][237]\n\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n\n\n*A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.*\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs (*ch, ll, rr, gu, qu*) are considered letters by the Royal Spanish Academy.[238]\n\n\nThe letters *k* and *w* are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages (*kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi*, etc.).\n\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as *México* (see Toponymy of Mexico), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including ⟨y⟩) or with a vowel followed by ⟨n⟩ or an ⟨s⟩; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel.\n\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare *el* ('the', masculine singular definite article) with *él* ('he' or 'it'), or *te* ('you', object pronoun) with *té* ('tea'), *de* (preposition 'of') versus *dé* ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and *se* (reflexive pronoun) versus *sé* ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\n\nThe interrogative pronouns (*qué*, *cuál*, *dónde*, *quién*, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives (*ése*, *éste*, *aquél*, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the *Real Academia Española* advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\n\nWhen *u* is written between *g* and a front vowel *e* or *i*, it indicates a \"hard g\" pronunciation. A diaeresis *ü* indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., *cigüeña*, 'stork', is pronounced [θiˈɣweɲa]; if it were written \\**cigueña*, it would be pronounced \\*[θiˈɣeɲa]).\n\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with inverted question and exclamation marks (¿ and ¡, respectively) and closed by the usual question and exclamation marks.\n\n\n\n## Organizations[edit]\n\n\n### Royal Spanish Academy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Royal Spanish Academy\n\nThe Royal Spanish Academy (*Real Academia Española*), founded in 1713,[239] together with the 21 other national ones (see Association of Spanish Language Academies), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.[240]\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language (Standard Spanish) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n\n\n### Association of Spanish Language Academies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Association of Spanish Language Academies\n\n![](image)Countries members of the ASALE[241]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies (*Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española*, or *ASALE*) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

This organization has branches in 45 countries, with 88 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language.[265] The goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The institute's 2015 report \"El español, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"El español en el mundo 2018\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.[266]\n\n\n\n### Official use by international organizations[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of countries where Spanish is an official language § International organizations.\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the African Union, the Union of South American Nations, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, the Latin Union, the Caricom, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Inter-American Development Bank, and numerous other international organizations.\n\n\n\n\n## Sample text[edit]\n\n\nArticle 1 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* in Spanish:\n\n\n\n*Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.*[267]\nArticle 1 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* in English:\n\n\n\n*All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Today, it is a global language with about 486 million native speakers, mainly in the Americas and Spain.[1] Spanish is the official language of 20 countries. It is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese;[5][6] the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); and the world's most widely spoken Romance language. The country with the largest population of native speakers is Mexico.[7]\n\n\nSpanish is part of the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century,[8] and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo, a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Spanish colonialism in the early modern period spurred on the introduction of the language to overseas locations, most notably to the Americas.[9]\n\n\nAs a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin, and has one of the smaller degrees of difference from it (about 20%) alongside Sardinian and Italian.[10] Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from Latin, including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek.[11][12] Alongside English and French, it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world.[13] Spanish does not feature prominently as a scientific language; however, it is better represented in areas like humanities and social sciences.[14] Spanish is also the third most used language on internet websites after English and Chinese.[15]\n\n\nSpanish is one of the six official languages of the United Nations, and it is also used as an official language by the European Union, Organization of American States, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, African Union and many other international organizations.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Name of the language and etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names given to the Spanish language\n\n### Name of the language[edit]\n\n\nIn Spain and in some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called not only *español* but also *castellano* (Castilian), the language from the Kingdom of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician, Basque, Asturian, Catalan, Aragonese and Occitan.\n\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term *castellano* to define the official language of the whole of Spain, in contrast to *las demás lenguas españolas* (lit. \"the other Spanish languages\"). Article III reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> *El castellano es la lengua española oficial del Estado. ... Las demás lenguas españolas serán también oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Autónomas...*  \n> \n> Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State. ... The other Spanish languages shall also be official in their respective Autonomous Communities...\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Most used term *castellano* or *español*\nThe Royal Spanish Academy (*Real Academia Española*), on the other hand, currently uses the term *español* in its publications. However, from 1713 to 1923, it called the language *castellano*.\n\n\nThe *Diccionario panhispánico de dudas* (a language guide published by the Royal Spanish Academy) states that, although the Royal Spanish Academy prefers to use the term *español* in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms—*español* and *castellano*—are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.[17]\n\n\n\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe term *castellano* is related to Castile (*Castilla* or archaically *Castiella*), the kingdom where the language was originally spoken. The name of Castile, in turn, is usually assumed to be derived from *castillo* ('castle').\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the language spoken in Castile was generically referred to as *Romance* and later also as *Lengua vulgar*.[18] Later in the period, it gained geographical specification as *Romance castellano* (\"romanz castellano\", \"romanz de Castiella\"), \"lenguaje de Castiella\", and ultimately simply as *castellano* (noun).[18]\n\n\nDifferent etymologies have been suggested for the term *español* (Spanish). According to the Royal Spanish Academy, *español* derives from the Occitan word *espaignol* and that, in turn, derives from the Vulgar Latin \\**hispaniolus* ('of Hispania').[19] Hispania was the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Spanish philologist Ramón Menéndez Pidal suggested that the classic *hispanus* or *hispanicus* took the suffix *-one* from Vulgar Latin, as happened with other words such as *bretón* (Breton) or *sajón* (Saxon).\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Spanish language\n\n![](image)The Visigothic Cartularies of Valpuesta, written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Royal Spanish Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the Glosas Emilianenses.[20]\nLike the other Romance languages, the Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War, beginning in 210 BC. Several pre-Roman languages (also called Paleohispanic languages)—some distantly related to Latin as Indo-European languages, and some that are not related at all—were previously spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included Proto-Basque, Iberian, Lusitanian, Celtiberian and Gallaecian.\n\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era, the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring Romance languages—Mozarabic (Andalusi Romance), Navarro-Aragonese, Leonese, Catalan, Portuguese, Galician, Occitan, and later, French and Italian. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from Arabic, as well as a minor influence from the Germanic Gothic language through the migration of tribes and a period of Visigoth rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both Classical Latin and Renaissance Latin, the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\n\nAccording to the theories of Ramón Menéndez Pidal, local sociolects of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of Burgos, and this dialect was later brought to the city of Toledo, where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.[21] In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, Leonese, and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see Iberian Romance languages). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the *Reconquista*, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al-Andalus, much of it indirectly, through the Romance Mozarabic dialects (some 4,000 Arabic-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).[22] The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of Toledo, in the 13th to 16th centuries, and Madrid, from the 1570s.[21]\n\n\nThe development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages, including lenition of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin *vīta* > Spanish *vida*). The diphthongization of Latin stressed short e and o—which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese—is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish | Ladino | Aragonese | Asturian | Galician | Portuguese | Catalan | Gascon / Occitan | French | Sardinian | Italian | Romanian | English\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| petra | *p**ie**dra* | *pedra* | *pedra*, *pèira* | *p**ie**rre* | *pedra*, *perda* | *p**ie**tra* | *p**ia**trǎ* | 'stone'\n |\n| terra | *t**ie**rra* | *terra* | *tèrra* | *terre* | *terra* | *țară* | 'land'\n |\n| moritur | *m**ue**re* | *m**ue**rre* | *morre* | *mor* | *morís* | *m**eu**rt* | *mòrit* | *m**uo**re* | *m**oa**re* | 'dies (v.)'\n |\n| mortem | *m**ue**rte* | *morte* | *mort* | *mòrt* | *mort* | *morte, morti* | *morte* | *m**oa**rte* | 'death'\n |\n\n![](image)Chronological map showing linguistic evolution in southwest Europe\nSpanish is marked by palatalization of the Latin double consonants (geminates) nn and ll (thus Latin\n*annum* > Spanish *año*, and Latin *anellum* > Spanish\n*anillo*).\n\n\nThe consonant written *u* or *v* in Latin and pronounced [w] in Classical Latin had probably \"fortified\" to a bilabial fricative /β/ in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written *b* (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic *b* and *v*.\n\n\nTypical of Spanish (as also of neighboring Gascon extending as far north as the Gironde estuary, and found in a small area of Calabria), attributed by some scholars to a Basque substratum was the mutation of Latin initial *f* into *h-* whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The *h-*, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects, it is still aspirated in some words. Because of borrowings from Latin and neighboring Romance languages, there are many *f*-/*h*- doublets in modern Spanish: *Fernando* and *Hernando* (both Spanish for \"Ferdinand\"), *ferrero* and *herrero* (both Spanish for \"smith\"), *fierro* and *hierro* (both Spanish for \"iron\"), and *fondo* and *hondo* (both words pertaining to depth in Spanish, though *fondo* means \"bottom\", while *hondo* means \"deep\"); additionally, *hacer* (\"to make\") is cognate to the root word of *satisfacer* (\"to satisfy\"), and *hecho* (\"made\") is similarly cognate to the root word of *satisfecho* (\"satisfied\").\n\n\nCompare the examples in the following table:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish | Ladino | Aragonese | Asturian | Galician | Portuguese | Catalan | Gascon / Occitan | French | Sardinian | Italian | Romanian | English\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| filium | ***h**ijo* | *fijo* (or *hijo*) | *fillo* | *fíu* | *fillo* | *filho* | *fill* | *filh*, ***h**ilh* | *fils* | *fizu, fìgiu, fillu* | *figlio* | *fiu* | 'son'\n |\n| facere | ***h**acer* | *fazer* | *fer* | *facer* | *fazer* | *fer* | *far*, *faire*, ***h**ar* (or ***h**èr*) | *faire* | *fàghere, fàere, *fàiri** | *fare* | *a face* | 'to do'\n |\n| febrem | *fiebre* *(calentura)* | *febre* | *fèbre*, *frèbe*, ***h**rèbe* (or***h**erèbe*) | *fièvre* | *calentura* | *febbre* | *febră* | 'fever'\n |\n| focum | *fuego* | *fueu* | *fogo* | *foc* | *fuòc*, *fòc*, ***h**uèc* | *feu* | *fogu* | *fuoco* | *foc* | 'fire'\n |\n\nSome consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages, as shown in the examples in the following table:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish | Ladino | Aragonese | Asturian | Galician | Portuguese | Catalan | Gascon / Occitan | French | Sardinian | Italian | Romanian | English\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **cl**āvem | ***ll**ave* | *clave* | *clau* | ***ll**ave* | *chave* | *chave* | *clau* | *clé* | *giae, crae,* *crai* | *chiave* | *cheie* | 'key'\n |\n| **fl**amma | ***ll**ama* | ***fl**ama* | *chama* | *chama*, *flama* | *flama* | *flamme* | *framma* | *fiamma* | *flamă* | 'flame'\n |\n| **pl**ēnum | ***ll**eno* | *pleno* | *plen* | ***ll**enu* | *cheo* | *cheio*, *pleno* | *ple* | *plen* | *plein* | *prenu* | *pieno* | *plin* | 'plenty, full'\n |\n| o**ct**ō | *o**ch**o* | *güeito* | *o**ch**o*, *oito* | *oito* | *oito* (*oi**t**o*) | *vuit*, *huit* | *uè**ch***, *uò**ch***, *uèit* | *huit* | *oto* | *otto* | *opt* | 'eight'\n |\n| mu**lt**um | *mu**ch**o**mu**y*** | *mu**nch**o**mu**y*** | *muito**mu**i*** | *mu**nch**u**mu**i*** | *moito**mo**i*** | *muito* | *molt* | *molt* (arch.) | *très,*\n*beaucoup,* *moult*\n | *meda* | *molto* | *mult* | 'much,very,many'\n |\n\n![](image)Antonio de Nebrija, author of *Gramática de la lengua castellana*, the first grammar of a modern European language[23]\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants, known in Spanish as the *reajuste de las sibilantes*, which resulted in the distinctive velar [x] pronunciation of the letter ⟨j⟩ and—in a large part of Spain—the characteristic interdental [θ] (\"th-sound\") for the letter ⟨z⟩ (and for ⟨c⟩ before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩). See History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants) for details.\n\n\nThe *Gramática de la lengua castellana*, written in Salamanca in 1492 by Elio Antonio de Nebrija, was the first grammar written for a modern European language.[24] According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I, she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire.[25] In his introduction to the grammar, dated 18 August 1492, Nebrija wrote that \"... language was always the companion of empire.\"[26]\n\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, the language was taken to the Spanish-discovered America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America. Miguel de Cervantes, author of *Don Quixote*, is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called *la lengua de Cervantes* (\"the language of Cervantes\").[27]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara, and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as Spanish Harlem in New York City.

As of 2023, it is estimated that about 486 million people speak Spanish as a native language, making it the second most spoken language by number of native speakers.[1] An additional 75 million speak Spanish as a second or foreign language, making it the fourth most spoken language in the world overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi with a total number of 538 million speakers.[29] Spanish is also the third most used language on the Internet, after English and Chinese.[30]\n\n\n\n### Europe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peninsular Spanish\n\n![](image)Percentage of people who self reportedly know enough Spanish to hold a conversation, in the EU, 2005 Native country\n More than 8.99%\n Between 4% and 8.99%\n Between 1% and 3.99%\n Less than 1%\n\nSpanish is the official language of Spain, the country after which it is named and from which it originated. Other European territories in which it is also widely spoken include Gibraltar and Andorra.[31]\n\n\nSpanish is also spoken by immigrant communities in other European countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany.[32] Spanish is an official language of the European Union.\n\n\n\n### Americas[edit]\n\n\n#### Hispanic America[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish language in the Americas\n\nToday, the majority of the Spanish speakers live in Hispanic America. Nationally, Spanish is the official language—either *de facto* or *de jure*—of Argentina, Bolivia (co-official with 36 indigenous languages), Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico (co-official with 63 indigenous languages), Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay (co-official with Guaraní),[33] Peru (co-official with Quechua, Aymara, and \"the other indigenous languages\"),[34] Puerto Rico (co-official with English),[35] Uruguay, and Venezuela.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish language in the United States\n\nSee also: New Mexican Spanish and Isleño Spanish\n\n![](image)Percentage of the U.S. population aged 5 and over who speaks Spanish at home in 2019, by states\nAccording to the 2020 census, over 60 million people of the U.S. population were of Hispanic or Hispanic American by origin.[36] In turn, 41.8 million people in the United States aged five or older speak Spanish at home, or about 13% of the population.[37] The Spanish language has a long history of presence in the United States due to early Spanish and, later, Mexican administration over territories now forming the southwestern states, also Louisiana ruled by Spain from 1762 to 1802, as well as Florida, which was Spanish territory until 1821, and Puerto Rico which was Spanish until 1898.\n\n\nSpanish is by far the most common second language in the country, with over 50 million total speakers if non-native or second-language speakers are included.[38] While English is the de facto national language of the country, Spanish is often used in public services and notices at the federal and state levels. Spanish is also used in administration in the state of New Mexico.[39] The language has a strong influence in major metropolitan areas such as those of Los Angeles, Miami, San Antonio, New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Tucson and Phoenix of the Arizona Sun Corridor, as well as more recently, Chicago, Las Vegas, Boston, Denver, Houston, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Salt Lake City, Atlanta, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, Raleigh and Baltimore-Washington, D.C. due to 20th- and 21st-century immigration.\n\n\n\n#### Rest of the Americas[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize (known until 1973 as British Honduras) where English is the sole official language, according to the 2010 census it was then spoken natively by 45% of the population and 56.6% of the total population were able to speak the language.[40]\n\n\nDue to their proximity to Spanish-speaking countries and small existing native Spanish speaking minority, Trinidad and Tobago has implemented Spanish language teaching into its education system. The Trinidad government launched the *Spanish as a First Foreign Language* (SAFFL) initiative in March 2005.[41]\n\n\nIn addition to sharing most of its borders with Spanish-speaking countries, the creation of Mercosur in the early 1990s induced a favorable situation for the promotion of Spanish language teaching in Brazil.[42][43] In 2005, the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill, signed into law by the President, making it mandatory for schools to offer Spanish as an alternative foreign language course in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil.[44] In September 2016 this law was revoked by Michel Temer after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff.[45] In many border towns and villages along Paraguay and Uruguay, a mixed language known as Portuñol is spoken.[46]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n#### Sub-Saharan Africa[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Equatoguinean Spanish\n\n![](image)Spanish language signage in Malabo, capital city of Equatorial Guinea\nEquatorial Guinea is the only Spanish-speaking country located entirely in Africa, with the language introduced during the Spanish colonial period.[47] Enshrined in the constitution as an official language (alongside French and Portuguese), Spanish features prominently in the Equatoguinean education system and is the primary language used in government and business.[48] Whereas it is not the mother tongue of virtually any of its speakers, the vast majority of the population is proficient in Spanish.[49] The Instituto Cervantes estimates that 87.7% of the population is fluent in Spanish.[50] This figure highlights Equatorial Guinea as having a higher proportion of proficient speakers of a colonial language relative to the respective metropolitan languages in other West and Central African nations.[51]\n\n\nSpanish is spoken by very small communities in Angola due to Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned for their country's independence.[52]\n\n\n\n#### North Africa and Macaronesia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Canarian Spanish and Saharan Spanish\n\nSpanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in Africa, namely the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean some 100 km (62 mi) off the northwest of the African mainland. The Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands, traces its origins back to the Castilian conquest in the 15th century, and, in addition to a resemblance to Western Andalusian speech patterns, it also features strong influence from the Spanish varieties spoken in the Americas,[53] which in turn have also been influenced historically by Canarian Spanish.[54]\n\n\nWhile far from the heyday of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, there are some presence of the Spanish language in the north of Morocco, stemming for example from the availability of certain Spanish-language media.[55] Many northern Moroccans have rudimentary knowledge of Spanish.[55] Spanish has also presence in the education system of the country (either by means of selected education centers running the Spain's education system, primarily located in the North, and the availability of Spanish as foreign language subject in secondary education).[55]\n\n\nIn Western Sahara, formerly Spanish Sahara, a primarily Hassaniya Arabic-speaking territory, Spanish was officially spoken as the language of the colonial administration during the late 19th and 20th centuries. Today, Spanish is present in the partially-recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf (Algeria), where the Spanish language is still taught as a second language, largely by Cuban educators.[56][57][58] The number of Spanish speakers is unknown.[*failed verification*][59][60]\n\n\nSpanish is also an official language of the African Union.\n\n\n\n### Asia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chavacano, Philippine Spanish, and Spanish language in the Philippines\n\n![](image)Spanish language newspaper in the Philippines from 1892\nSpanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish administration in 1565 to a constitutional change in 1973. During Spanish colonization, it was the language of government, trade, and education, and was spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos (*Ilustrados*). Despite a public education system set up by the colonial government, by the end of Spanish rule in 1898, only about 10% of the population had knowledge of Spanish, mostly those of Spanish descent or elite standing.[61]\n\n\nSpanish continued to be official and used in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American administration after the Spanish–American War but was eventually replaced by English as the primary language of administration and education by the 1920s.[62] Nevertheless, despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers, Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines upon independence in 1946, alongside English and Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog.\n\n\nSpanish was briefly removed from official status in 1973 but reimplemented under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos two months later.[63] It remained an official language until the ratification of the present constitution in 1987, in which it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.[64] In recent years changing attitudes among non-Spanish speaking Filipinos have helped spur a revival of the language,[65][66] and starting in 2009 Spanish was reintroduced as part of the basic education curriculum in a number of public high schools, becoming the largest foreign language program offered by the public school system,[67] with over 7,000 students studying the language in the 2021–2022 school year alone.[68] The local business process outsourcing industry has also helped boost the language's economic prospects.[69] Today, while the actual number of proficient Spanish speakers is around 400,000, or under 0.5% of the population,[70] a new generation of Spanish speakers in the Philippines has likewise emerged, though speaker estimates vary widely.[71]\n\n\nAside from standard Spanish, a Spanish-based creole language called Chavacano developed in the southern Philippines. However, it is not mutually intelligible with Spanish.[72] The number of Chavacano-speakers was estimated at 1.2 million in 1996.[73] The local languages of the Philippines also retain significant Spanish influence, with many words derived from Mexican Spanish, owing to the administration of the islands by Spain through New Spain until 1821, until direct governance from Madrid afterwards to 1898.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Oceania[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Announcement in Spanish on Easter Island, welcoming visitors to Rapa Nui National Park\nSpanish is the official and most spoken language on Easter Island, which is geographically part of Polynesia in Oceania and politically part of Chile. However, Easter Island's traditional language is Rapa Nui, an Eastern Polynesian language.\n\n\nAs a legacy of comprising the former Spanish East Indies, Spanish loan words are present in the local languages of Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Marshall Islands and Micronesia.[76][77]\n\n\nIn addition, in Australia and New Zealand, there are native Spanish communities, resulting from emigration from Spanish-speaking countries (mainly from the Southern Cone).[78]\n\n\n\n### Spanish speakers by country[edit]\n\n\n20 countries and one United States territory speak Spanish officially, and the language has a significant unofficial presence in the rest of the United States along with Andorra, Belize and the territory of Gibraltar.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldwide Spanish fluency (grey and \\* signifies official language)\n| Country\n | Population[79] | Speakers of Spanish as a native language[80] | Native speakers and proficient speakers as a second language[81] | Total number of Spanish speakers (including limited competence speakers)[81][82] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mexico\\*\n | 131,230,255[83] | 123,093,979 (93.8%)[84] | 127,030,887 (96.8%)[2] | 130,180,412 (99.2%)[84] |\n| United States | 333,287,557[85] | 42,032,538 (13.3%)[86] | 42,032,538 (82% of U.S. Hispanics speak Spanish very well (according to a 2011 survey).[87] There are 63.5 million Hispanics in the U.S. as of 2022[88] + 2.8 mill. non Hispanic Spanish speakers[89]) | 57,032,538[2] (42 million as a first language + 15 million as a second language.

Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish grammar\n\n![](image)Miguel de Cervantes, considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of *Don Quixote*, widely considered the first modern European novel\nMost of the grammatical and typological features of Spanish are shared with the other Romance languages. Spanish is a fusional language. The noun and adjective systems exhibit two genders and two numbers. In addition, articles and some pronouns and determiners have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty conjugated forms per verb, with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 verboid forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. The indicative mood is the unmarked one, while the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or indetermination, and is commonly paired with the conditional, which is a mood used to express \"would\" (as in, \"I would eat if I had food); the imperative is a mood to express a command, commonly a one word phrase – \"¡Di!\", \"¡Talk!\".\n\n\nVerbs express T-V distinction by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs.)\n\n\nSpanish syntax is considered right-branching, meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after head words. The language uses prepositions (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case), and usually—though not always—places adjectives after nouns, as do most other Romance languages.\n\n\nSpanish is classified as a subject–verb–object language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by topicalization and focus rather than by syntax. It is a \"pro-drop\", or \"null-subject\" language—that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"verb-framed\" language, meaning that the *direction* of motion is expressed in the verb while the *mode* of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. *subir corriendo* or *salir volando*; the respective English equivalents of these examples—'to run up' and 'to fly out'—show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSpanish as spoken in Spain (by folklorist Fermín Pardo Pardo)\nMain article: Spanish phonology\n\nThe Spanish phonological system evolved from that of Vulgar Latin. Its development exhibits some traits in common with other Western Romance languages, others with the neighboring Hispanic varieties—especially Leonese and Aragonese—as well as other features unique to Spanish. Spanish is alone among its immediate neighbors in having undergone frequent aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial /f/ sound (e.g. Cast. *harina* vs. Leon. and Arag. *farina*).[198] The Latin initial consonant sequences *pl-*, *cl-*, and *fl-* in Spanish typically merge as *ll-* (originally pronounced [ʎ]), while in Aragonese they are preserved in most dialects, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including [tʃ], [ʃ], and [ʎ]. Where Latin had *-li-* before a vowel (e.g. *filius*) or the ending *-iculus*, *-icula* (e.g. *auricula*), Old Spanish produced [ʒ], that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative [x] (*hijo*, *oreja*), whereas neighboring languages have the palatal lateral [ʎ] (e.g. Portuguese *filho*, *orelha*; Catalan *fill*, *orella*).\n\n\n\n### Segmental phonology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Spanish vowel chart, from Ladefoged & Johnson (2010:227)\nThe Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect[199]). The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels /i/ and /u/ to glides—[j] and [w] respectively—when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels /e/ and /o/, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs /je/ and /we/ respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three nasal phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) lateral phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant; (2) three voiceless stops and the affricate /tʃ/; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) voiceless fricatives; (4) a set of voiced obstruents—/b/, /d/, /ɡ/, and sometimes /ʝ/—which alternate between approximant and plosive allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"tapped\" and \"trilled\" *r*-sounds (single ⟨r⟩ and double ⟨rr⟩ in orthography).\n\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, /ʎ/ is marked with an asterisk (\\*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with /ʝ/ in the merger called *yeísmo*. Similarly, /θ/ is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from /s/ (see *seseo*), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\n\nThe phoneme /ʃ/ is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in loanwords. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes /b/, /d/, /ʝ/, and /ɡ/ appears to the right of a *pair* of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the *voiceless* phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the *voiced* ones alternate allophonically (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonant phonemes[200]\n|  | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Palatal | Velar |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasal |  | m |  |  | n |  | ɲ |  |\n| Stop | p | b | t | d |  |  | tʃ | ʝ | k | ɡ |\n| Continuant | f | θ\\*\n | s | (ʃ)\n | x |\n| Lateral |  |  |  | l |  | ʎ\\*\n |  |\n| Flap |  |  |  | ɾ |  |  |\n| Trill |  |  |  | r |  |  |\n\n\n### Prosody[edit]\n\n\nSpanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable-timed language: each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.[201][202]\n\n\nSpanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.) and rising tone for yes/no questions.[203][204] There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements and thus, the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation.\n\n\nStress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-to-last or earlier syllables. Stress tends to occur as follows:[205][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n* in words that end with a monophthong, on the penultimate syllable\n* when the word ends in a diphthong, on the final syllable.\n* in words that end with a consonant, on the last syllable, with the exception of two grammatical endings: *-n*, for third-person-plural of verbs, and *-s*, for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs. However, even though a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with *-n* are also stressed on the penult (*joven*, *virgen*, *mitin*), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with *-n* are stressed on their last syllable (*capitán*, *almacén*, *jardín*, *corazón*).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with clitic pronouns attached (e.g. *guardándoselos* 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous minimal pairs that contrast solely on stress such as *sábana* ('sheet') and *sabana* ('savannah'); *límite* ('boundary'), *limite* ('he/she limits') and *limité* ('I limited'); *líquido* ('liquid'), *liquido* ('I sell off') and *liquidó* ('he/she sold off').\n\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is ⟨n⟩, ⟨s⟩, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (See Spanish orthography.)\n\n\n\n## Speaker population[edit]\n\n\nSpanish is the official, or national language in 18 countries and one territory in the Americas, Spain, and Equatorial Guinea. With a population of over 410 million, Hispanophone America accounts for the vast majority of Spanish speakers, of which Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country. In the European Union, Spanish is the mother tongue of 8% of the population, with an additional 7% speaking it as a second language.[206] Additionally, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States and is by far the most popular foreign language among students.[207] In 2015, it was estimated that over 50 million Americans spoke Spanish, about 41 million of whom were native speakers.[208] With continued immigration and increased use of the language domestically in public spheres and media, the number of Spanish speakers in the United States is expected to continue growing over the forthcoming decades.[209]\n\n\n\n## Dialectal variation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A world map attempting to identify the main dialects of Spanish\nMain article: Spanish dialects and varieties\n\nWhile being mutually intelligible, there are important variations (phonological, grammatical, and lexical) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\n\nThe national variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.[210][211]\n\n\nIn Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. The speech from the educated classes of Madrid is the standard variety for use on radio and television in Spain and it is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.[212] Central (European) Spanish speech patterns have been noted to be in the process of merging with more innovative southern varieties (including Eastern Andalusian and Murcian), as an emerging interdialectal levelled *koine* buffered between the Madrid's traditional national standard and the Seville speech trends.[213]\n\n\n\n### Phonology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Phonetic change \"f → h\" in Spanish\n\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|/θ/]] (\"theta\"), (2) the debuccalization of syllable-final /s/, (3) the sound of the spelled ⟨s⟩, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|/ʎ/]] (\"turned *y*\"),[214]\n\n\n\n* The phoneme /θ/ (spelled *c* before *e* or *i* and spelled ⟨z⟩ elsewhere), a voiceless dental fricative as in English ***th**ing*, is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the Canary Islands, and the Americas), /θ/ does not exist and /s/ occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called *distinción* in Spanish, while the merger is generally called *seseo* (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as [s]) or, occasionally, *ceceo* (referring to its interdental realization, [θ], in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled ⟨c⟩ before ⟨e⟩ or ⟨i⟩, and spelled ⟨z⟩ is always pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant.\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as [h], or loss) of syllable-final /s/ is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and *aspiración* in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final /s/ is pronounced as voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant or as a voiceless dental sibilant in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter ⟨s⟩ is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant [s̺] (also described acoustically as \"grave\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of retroflex fricatives. In Andalusia, Canary Islands and most of Hispanic America (except in the Paisa region of Colombia) it is pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant [s], much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English.\n* The phoneme /ʎ/, spelled ⟨ll⟩, a palatal lateral consonant that can be approximated by the sound of the ⟨lli⟩ of English *million*, tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in the highland areas of South America, as well as in Paraguay and lowland Bolivia. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish speakers, it is merged with /ʝ/ (\"curly-tail *j*\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English /j/ (*yod*) as in ***y**acht* and spelled ⟨y⟩ in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled ⟨ll⟩ and the spelled ⟨y⟩ is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called *yeísmo* in Spanish. In Rioplatense Spanish, the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced [ʒ] (as in English *measure* or the French ⟨j⟩) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region (*zheísmo*), or voiceless [ʃ] (as in the French ⟨ch⟩ or Portuguese ⟨x⟩) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo (*sheísmo*).[215]\n\n\n### Morphology[edit]\n\n\nThe main morphological variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns, especially those of the second person and, to a lesser extent, the object pronouns of the third person.\n\n\n\n#### Voseo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Voseo\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Data generated as illustrated by the Association of Spanish Language Academies. The darker the area, the stronger its dominance.\nVirtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second-person singular and thus have two different pronouns meaning \"you\": *usted* in the formal and either *tú* or *vos* in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of *tú* or *vos* varying from one dialect to another. The use of *vos* and its verb forms is called *voseo*. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with *usted*, *tú*, and *vos* denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.[216]\n\n\nIn *voseo*, *vos* is the subject form (*vos decís*, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a preposition (*voy con vos*, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect object forms, and the possessives, are the same as those associated with *tú*: *Vos sabés que tus amigos te respetan* (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\n\nThe verb forms of the general *voseo* are the same as those used with *tú* except in the present tense (indicative and imperative) verbs. The forms for *vos* generally can be derived from those of *vosotros* (the traditional second-person familiar *plural*) by deleting the glide [i̯], or /d/, where it appears in the ending: *vosotros pensá**i**s* > *vos pensás*; *vosotros volvé**i**s* > *vos volvés*, *pensa**d**!* (*vosotros*) > *pensá!* (*vos*), *volve**d**!* (*vosotros*) > *volvé!* (*vos*).[217]\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral voseo (River Plate Spanish)\n| Indicative\n | Subjunctive\n | Imperative\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Present\n | Simple past\n | Imperfect past\n | Future\n | Conditional\n | Present\n | Past\n |\n| *pensás* | ***pensaste*** | ***pensabas*** | ***pensarás*** | ***pensarías*** | ***pienses*** | ***pensaras******pensases*** | *pensá* |\n| *volvés* | ***volviste*** | ***volvías*** | ***volverás*** | ***volverías*** | ***vuelvas*** | ***volvieras******volvieses*** | *volvé* |\n| *dormís* | ***dormiste*** | ***dormías*** | ***dormirás*** | ***dormirías*** | ***duermas*** | ***durmieras******durmieses*** | *dormí* |\n| The forms in ***bold*** coincide with standard ***tú**-conjugation*. |\n\n\nIn Chilean *voseo* on the other hand, almost all verb forms are distinct from their standard *tú*-forms.\n\n\n\n\n\nChilean voseo\n| Indicative\n | Subjunctive\n | Imperative\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Present\n | Simple past\n | Imperfect past\n | Future[218] | Conditional\n | Present\n | Past\n |\n| *pensái(s)* | ***pensaste*** | *pensabais* | *pensarí(s)**pensaráis* | *pensaríai(s)* | *pensí(s)* | *pensarai(s)****pensases*** | ***piensa*** |\n| *volví(s)* | ***volviste*** | *volvíai(s)* | *volverí(s)**volveráis* | *volveríai(s)* | *volvái(s)* | *volvierai(s)****volvieses*** | ***vuelve*** |\n| *dormís* | ***dormiste*** | *dormíais* | *dormirís**dormiráis* | *dormiríais* | *durmáis* | *durmierais****durmieses*** | ***duerme*** |\n| The forms in ***bold*** coincide with standard ***tú**-conjugation*. |\n\n\nThe use of the pronoun *vos* with the verb forms of *tú* (*vos piensas*) is called \"pronominal *voseo*\". Conversely, the use of the verb forms of *vos* with the pronoun *tú* (*tú pensás* or *tú pensái*) is called \"verbal *voseo*\".  \nIn Chile, for example, verbal *voseo* is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun *vos*, which is usually reserved for highly informal situations.\n\n\nIn Central American *voseo*, one can see even further distinction.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral American voseo\n| Indicative\n | Subjunctive\n | Imperative\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Present\n | Simple past\n | Imperfect past\n | Future\n | Conditional\n | Present\n | Past\n |\n| *pensás* | ***pensaste*** | ***pensabas*** | ***pensarás*** | ***pensarías*** | *pensés* | ***pensaras******pensases*** | *pensá* |\n| *volvés* | ***volviste*** | ***volvías*** | ***volverás*** | ***volverías*** | *volvás* | ***volvieras******volvieses*** | *volvé* |\n| *dormís* | ***dormiste*** | ***dormías*** | ***dormirás*** | ***dormirías*** | *durmás* | ***durmieras******durmieses*** | *dormí* |\n| The forms in ***bold*** coincide with standard ***tú**-conjugation*. |\n\n\n##### Distribution in Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas[edit]\n\n\nAlthough *vos* is not used in Spain, it occurs in many Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, with wide differences in social consideration.[219][*better source needed*] Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of *tuteo* (the use of *tú*) in the following areas: almost all of Mexico, the West Indies, Panama, most of Colombia, Peru, Venezuela and coastal Ecuador.\n\n\n*Tuteo* as a cultured form alternates with *voseo* as a popular or rural form in Bolivia, in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that *voseo* can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.[220]\n\n\n*Tuteo* exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar *voseo* in Chile, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama, in the Mexican state of Chiapas, and in parts of Guatemala.\n\n\nAreas of generalized *voseo* include Argentina, Nicaragua, eastern Bolivia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Quindio and Valle del Cauca.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Ustedes[edit]\n\n\n*Ustedes* functions as formal and informal second-person plural in all of Hispanic America, the Canary Islands, and parts of Andalusia. It agrees with verbs in the 3rd person plural. Most of Spain maintains the formal/familiar distinction with *ustedes* and *vosotros* respectively. The use of *ustedes* with the second person plural is sometimes heard in Andalusia, but it is non-standard.\n\n\n\n#### Usted[edit]\n\n\n*Usted* is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a *familiar* context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of *tú* or *vos*. This usage is sometimes called *ustedeo* in Spanish.\n\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, *usted* is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. *Usted* is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n\n\n#### Third-person object pronouns[edit]\n\n\nMost speakers use (and the *Real Academia Española* prefers) the pronouns *lo* and *la* for *direct* objects (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of animacy, meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and *le* for *indirect* objects (regardless of gender or animacy, meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"*leísmo*\", \"*loísmo*\", or \"*laísmo*\", according to which respective pronoun, *le*, *lo*, or *la*, has expanded beyond the etymological usage (*le* as a direct object, or *lo* or *la* as an indirect object).\n\n\n\n### Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish *mantequilla*, *aguacate* and *albaricoque* (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to *manteca* (word used for lard in Peninsular Spanish), *palta*, and *damasco*, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except *manteca*), Paraguay, Peru (except *manteca* and *damasco*), and Uruguay.\n\n\n\n## Relation to other languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish\n\nSpanish is closely related to the other West Iberian Romance languages, including Asturian, Aragonese, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Mirandese and Portuguese.\n\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.[221][222][223][224] Mutual intelligibility of the *written* Spanish and Portuguese languages is high, lexically and grammatically. *Ethnologue* gives estimates of the lexical similarity between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%, although phonologically the two languages are quite dissimilar. Italian on the other hand, is phonologically similar to Spanish, while sharing lower lexical and grammatical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or between Spanish and Romanian is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.[225][226] Comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\n\nThe Spanish vocabulary has been influenced by several languages: As in other European languages, Classical Greek words (Hellenisms) are abundant in several fields, mainly in Art, Science, Politics, Nature, etc.[227] Its vocabulary has also been influenced by Arabic, having developed during the Al-Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula, with around 8% of its vocabulary having Arabic lexical roots.[228][229][230][231] It has also been influenced by Basque, Iberian, Celtiberian, Visigothic, and other neighboring Ibero-Romance languages.[232][231] Additionally, it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages, particularly other Romance languages such as French, Latin, Mozarabic, Portuguese, Galician, Catalan, Occitan, and Sardinian, as well as from Quechua, Nahuatl, and other indigenous languages of the Americas.[233]\n\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n\n\n\n| Latin | Spanish\n | Galician | Portuguese | Astur-Leonese | Aragonese | Catalan | French | Italian | Romanian | English |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| nōs (alterōs)1,2\"we (others)\"\n | ***nosotros*** | ***nós**, **nosoutros***3 | *nós, nós outros*3 | ***nós***, ***nosotros*** | ***nusatros*** | ***nosaltres***(arch. ***nós***)\n | *nous*4 | *noi, noialtri*5 | *noi* | 'we'\n |\n| frātre(m) germānu(m)\"true brother\"\n | ***hermano*** | ***irmán*** | *irmão* | ***hermanu*** | ***chirmán*** | ***germà***(arch. ***frare***)6 | *frère* | *fratello* | *frate* | 'brother'\n |\n| die(m) mārtis (Classical)\"day of Mars\"tertia(m) fēria(m) (Late Latin)\"third (holi)day\"\n | ***Martes*** | ***Martes**, **Terza Feira*** | *Terça-Feira* | ***Martes*** | ***Martes*** | ***Dimarts*** | *Mardi* | *Martedì* | *Marți* | 'Tuesday'\n |\n| cantiōne(m)canticu(m) | ***canción***7(arch. ***cançón***)\n | ***canción**, **cançom***8 | *canção* | ***canción***(also ***canciu***)\n | ***canta*** | ***cançó*** | *chanson* | *canzone* | *cântec* | 'song'\n |\n| magisplūs | ***más***(arch. ***plus***)\n | ***máis*** | *mais* | ***más*** | ***más***(also ***més***)\n | ***més***(arch. ***pus*** or ***plus***)\n | *plus* | *più* | *mai* | 'more'\n |\n| manu(m) sinistra(m) | ***mano izquierda***9(arch. ***mano siniestra***)\n | ***man esquerda***9 | *mão esquerda*9(arch. *mão sẽestra*)\n | ***manu izquierda***9(or ***esquierda***;also ***manzorga***)\n | ***man cucha*** | ***mà esquerra***9(arch. ***mà sinistra***)\n | *main gauche* | *mano sinistra* | *mâna stângă* | 'left hand'\n |\n| rēs, rĕm \"thing\"nūlla(m) rem nāta(m)\"no born thing\"mīca(m) \"crumb\"\n | ***nada*** | ***nada***(also ***ren*** and ***res***)\n | *nada (arch. rés)* | ***nada***(also ***un res***)\n | ***cosa*** | ***res*** | *rien, nul* | *niente, nulla**mica* (negative particle)\n | *nimic, nul* | 'nothing'\n |\n| cāseu(m) fōrmāticu(m)\"form-cheese\"\n | ***queso*** | ***queixo*** | *queijo* | ***quesu*** | ***queso*** | ***formatge*** | *fromage* | *formaggio/cacio* | *caș*10 | 'cheese'\n |\n\n\n1.

This negative meaning also applies for Latin *sinistra(m)* (\"dark, unfortunate\").  \n\n10. Romanian *caș* (from Latin cāsevs) means a type of cheese. The universal term for cheese in Romanian is *brânză* (from unknown etymology).[234]\n\n\n\n\n### Judaeo-Spanish[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Judaeo-Spanish\n\n![](image)The Rashi script, originally used to print Judaeo-Spanish\n![](image)An original letter in Haketia, written in 1832\nJudaeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino,[235] is a variety of Spanish which preserves many features of medieval Spanish and some old Portuguese and is spoken by descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the 15th century.[235] While in Portugal the conversion of Jews occurred earlier and the assimilation of New Christians was overwhelming, in Spain the Jews kept their language and identity. The relationship of Ladino and Spanish is therefore comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively Sephardi Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.[235] Judaeo-Spanish lacks the Native American vocabulary which was acquired by standard Spanish during the Spanish colonial period, and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from Hebrew, French, Greek and Turkish, and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly *olim* (immigrants to Israel) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to assimilation by modern Spanish.\n\n\nA related dialect is Haketia, the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too, tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spanish orthography\n\n\n\n| Spanish language |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)A manuscript of the *Cantar de mio Cid*, 13th century\n |\n| \nOverview |\n| * Pronunciation\n\t+ stress\n* Orthography\n* Names\n |\n| History |\n| * Old\n* Middle\n* Influences\n |\n| Grammar |\n| * Determiners\n* Nouns\n\t+ gender\n* Pronouns\n\t+ personal\n\t+ object\n* Adjectives\n* Prepositions\n* Verbs\n\t+ conjugation\n\t+ irregular verbs\n |\n| Dialects |\n| * Andalusian\n* Andean\n* Argentine\n* Belizean\n* Bolivian\n* Canarian\n* Caribbean\n* Central American\n* Chilean\n* Colombian\n* Costa Rican\n* Cuban\n* Dominican\n* Ecuadorian\n* Equatoguinean\n* Guatemalan\n* Honduran\n* Mexican\n* Murcian\n* New Mexican\n* Nicaraguan\n* Paraguay\n* Panamanian\n* Peninsular\n* Peruvian\n* Philippine\n\t+ status\n* Puerto Rican\n* Rioplatense\n* Saharan\n* Salvadoran\n* Standard\n* Uruguayan\n* Venezuelan\n |\n| Dialectology |\n| * Seseo\n* Yeísmo\n* Voseo\n* Leísmo\n* Loísmo\n |\n| Interlanguages |\n| * Llanito\n* Jopara\n* Judaeo-Spanish\n* Portuñol\n* Spanglish\n* Castrapo\n* Creoles\n* Roquetas Pidgin\n* Chavacano or Chabacano\n* Palenquero or Palenque\n |\n| Teaching |\n| * Hispanism\n* RAE\n* Instituto Cervantes\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nSpanish is written in the Latin script, with the addition of the character ⟨ñ⟩ (*eñe*, representing the phoneme /ɲ/, a letter distinct from ⟨n⟩, although typographically composed of an ⟨n⟩ with a tilde). Formerly the digraphs ⟨ch⟩ (*che*, representing the phoneme /t͡ʃ/) and ⟨ll⟩ (*elle*, representing the phoneme /ʎ/ or /ʝ/), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph ⟨rr⟩ (*erre fuerte*, 'strong r', *erre doble*, 'double r', or simply *erre*), which also represents a distinct phoneme /r/, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨ll⟩ have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with ⟨ch⟩ are now alphabetically sorted between those with ⟨cg⟩ and ⟨ci⟩, instead of following ⟨cz⟩ as they used to. The situation is similar for ⟨ll⟩.[236][237]\n\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n\n\n*A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.*\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs (*ch, ll, rr, gu, qu*) are considered letters by the Royal Spanish Academy.[238]\n\n\nThe letters *k* and *w* are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages (*kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi*, etc.).\n\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as *México* (see Toponymy of Mexico), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including ⟨y⟩) or with a vowel followed by ⟨n⟩ or an ⟨s⟩; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel.\n\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain homophones, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic: compare *el* ('the', masculine singular definite article) with *él* ('he' or 'it'), or *te* ('you', object pronoun) with *té* ('tea'), *de* (preposition 'of') versus *dé* ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and *se* (reflexive pronoun) versus *sé* ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\n\nThe interrogative pronouns (*qué*, *cuál*, *dónde*, *quién*, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives (*ése*, *éste*, *aquél*, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the *Real Academia Española* advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\n\nWhen *u* is written between *g* and a front vowel *e* or *i*, it indicates a \"hard g\" pronunciation. A diaeresis *ü* indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., *cigüeña*, 'stork', is pronounced [θiˈɣweɲa]; if it were written \\**cigueña*, it would be pronounced \\*[θiˈɣeɲa]).\n\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with inverted question and exclamation marks (¿ and ¡, respectively) and closed by the usual question and exclamation marks.\n\n\n\n## Organizations[edit]\n\n\n### Royal Spanish Academy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Royal Spanish Academy\n\nThe Royal Spanish Academy (*Real Academia Española*), founded in 1713,[239] together with the 21 other national ones (see Association of Spanish Language Academies), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.[240]\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language (Standard Spanish) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n\n\n### Association of Spanish Language Academies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Association of Spanish Language Academies\n\n![](image)Countries members of the ASALE[241]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies (*Asociación de Academias de la Lengua Española*, or *ASALE*) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language. It was created in Mexico in 1951 and represents the union of all the separate academies in the Spanish-speaking world. It comprises the academies of 23 countries, ordered by date of academy foundation: Spain (1713),[242] Colombia (1871),[243] Ecuador (1874),[244] Mexico (1875),[245] El Salvador (1876),[246] Venezuela (1883),[247] Chile (1885),[248] Peru (1887),[249] Guatemala (1887),[250] Costa Rica (1923),[251] Philippines (1924),[252] Panama (1926),[253] Cuba (1926),[254]\nParaguay (1927),[255] Dominican Republic (1927),[256] Bolivia (1927),[257] Nicaragua (1928),[258] Argentina (1931),[259] Uruguay (1943),[260] Honduras (1949),[261] Puerto Rico (1955),[262] United States (1973)[263] and Equatorial Guinea (2016).[264]\n\n\n\n\n### Cervantes Institute[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Instituto Cervantes\n\nThe Instituto Cervantes ('Cervantes Institute') is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branches in 45 countries, with 88 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language.[265] The goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The institute's 2015 report \"El español, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"El español en el mundo 2018\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the U.S. Census Bureau, which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.[266]\n\n\n\n### Official use by international organizations[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of countries where Spanish is an official language § International organizations.\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the United Nations, the European Union, the World Trade Organization, the Organization of American States, the Organization of Ibero-American States, the African Union, the Union of South American Nations, the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat, the Latin Union, the Caricom, the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Inter-American Development Bank, and numerous other international organizations.\n\n\n\n\n## Sample text[edit]\n\n\nArticle 1 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* in Spanish:\n\n\n\n*Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros.*[267]\nArticle 1 of the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* in English:\n\n\n\n*All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.

Modern English is both the most spoken language in the world[7] and the third-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.[8] It is also the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers.\n\n\nEnglish is either the official language or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states (such as in India, Ireland, and Canada). In some other countries, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law (such as in the United States or United Kingdom).[9] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. English accounts for at least 70% of total speakers of the Germanic language branch, and as of 2005, it was estimated that there were over two billion speakers worldwide.[10]\n\n\nOld English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language.[11][12][13] Then, Middle English borrowed words extensively from French dialects, which make up about 28% of Modern English words, and from Latin, which also provides about 28%.[14] Thus, although most of its vocabulary now comes from Romance languages, its grammar, phonology, and most commonly-used words keep it genealogically classified under the Germanic branch. English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots and then is most closely related to the Low Saxon and Frisian languages.\n\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)**Anglic languages** English\n Scots\n within the **Anglo-Frisian languages**, which also include Frisian (West, North, Saterland);\n within the **North Sea Germanic languages**, which also include Low German/Saxon;\n within the **West Germanic languages**, which also include Dutch in Europe and Afrikaans in Africa\n ...... German (High): Central; in Lux.: Luxembourgish\n Upper\n ...... Yiddish\n![](image)A family tree of the West Germanic language family\nEnglish is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.[15] Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles, and into the Frisian languages and Low German/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the Anglo-Frisian languages, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.[12] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.[16] Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots[17] and the extinct Fingallian dialect and Yola language of Ireland.[18]\n\n\nLike Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and it has since diverged considerably. English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.[19]\n\n\nUnlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole—a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.[20][21]\n\n\nEnglish is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish.[22] These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see Phonological history of Old English § Palatalization).[23]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of English\n\n### Overview of history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest varieties of an English language, collectively known as Old English or \"Anglo-Saxon\", evolved from a group of North Sea Germanic dialects brought to Britain in the 5th century. Old English dialects were later influenced by Old Norse-speaking Viking settlers and invaders, starting in the 8th and 9th centuries. Middle English began in the late 11th century after the Norman Conquest of England, when considerable Old French, especially Old Norman French, and Latin-derived vocabulary was incorporated into English over some three hundred years.[24][25]\n\n\nEarly Modern English began in the late 15th century with the start of the Great Vowel Shift and the Renaissance trend of borrowing further Latin and Greek words and roots, concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to London. This era notably culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.[26][27] The printing press greatly standardised English spelling,[*citation needed*] which has remained largely unchanged since then, despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in English dialects.\n\n\nModern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the *lingua franca* in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation, and law.[4] Its modern grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order.[28] Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspects and moods, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives, and some negation.\n\n\n\n### Proto-Germanic to Old English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Old English\n\n![](image)The opening of *Beowulf*, an Old English epic poem handwritten in half-uncial script between 975 AD and 1025 AD: *Hƿæt ƿē Gārde/na ingēar dagum þēod cyninga / þrym ge frunon...* (\"Listen! We of the Spear-Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk-kings...\")\nThe earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066). Old English developed from a set of West Germanic dialects, often grouped as Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic, and originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony and southern Jutland by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.[29] From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the 7th century, this Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and British Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.[30][31][32] At this time, these dialects generally resisted influence from the then-local Brittonic and Latin languages. *England* and *English* (originally *Ænglaland* and *Ænglisc*) are both named after the Angles.[33]\n\n\nOld English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects (Mercian and Northumbrian) and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West Saxon.[34] Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety.[35] The epic poem *Beowulf* is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, *Cædmon's Hymn*, is written in Northumbrian.[36] Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script.[37] By the 6th century, a Latin alphabet was adopted, written with half-uncial letterforms. It included the runic letters *wynn* ⟨*ƿ*⟩ and *thorn* ⟨*þ*⟩, and the modified Latin letters *eth* ⟨*ð*⟩, and *ash* ⟨*æ*⟩.[37][38]\n\n\nOld English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German: nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (*he*, *him*, *his*) and has a few verb inflections (*speak*, *speaks*, *speaking*, *spoke*, *spoken*), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.[39][40][41] Its closest relative is Old Frisian, but even some centuries after the Anglo-Saxon migration, Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility with other Germanic varieties. Even in the 9th and 10th centuries, amidst the Danelaw and other Viking invasions, there is historical evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility,[42] although probably the northern dialects of Old English were more similar to Old Norse than the southern dialects. Theoretically, as late as the 900s AD, a commoner from certain (northern) parts of England could hold a conversation with a commoner from certain parts of Scandinavia. Research continues into the details of the myriad tribes in peoples in England and Scandinavia and the mutual contacts between them.[42]\n\n\nThe translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 shows examples of case endings (nominative plural, accusative plural, genitive singular) and a verb ending (present plural):\n\n\n\n* *Foxas habbað holu and heofonan fuglas nest*\n* Fox-as habb-að hol-u and heofon-an fugl-as nest-∅\n* fox-NOM.PL have-PRS.PL hole-ACC.PL and heaven-GEN.SG bird-NOM.PL nest-ACC.PL\n* \"Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven nests\"[43]\n\n\n### Influence of Old Norse[edit]\n\n\nFrom the 8th to the 11th centuries, Old English gradually transformed through language contact with Old Norse in some regions. The waves of Norse (Viking) colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. The centre of norsified English was in the Midlands around Lindsey. After 920 CE, when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, English spread extensively throughout the region.\n\n\nAn element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with *th-* (*they, them, their*) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with *h-* (*hie, him, hera*).[44] Other core Norse loanwords include \"give\", \"get\", \"sky\", \"skirt\", \"egg\", and \"cake\", typically displacing a native Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English, particularly northern ones.\n\n\n\n### Middle English[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Middle English and Influence of French on English\n\n![](image)The University of Oxford in Oxford, the world's oldest English-speaking university and world's second-oldest university, founded in 1096\n![](image)The University of Cambridge in Cambridge, the world's second-oldest English-speaking university and world's third-oldest university, founded in 1209\n> \n> *Englischmen þeyz hy hadde fram þe bygynnyng þre manner speche, Souþeron, Northeron, and Myddel speche in þe myddel of þe lond, ...

Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating gnashing.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJohn Trevisa, c. 1385[45]\n\nMiddle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200 to 1450.\n\n\nWith the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, the now-Norsified Old English language was subject to another wave of intense contact, this time with Old French, in particular Old Norman French. Old Norman French in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman.[24] Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking English, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.[13] Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,[46] and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.[47]\n\n\nIn Wycliff'e Bible of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written: *Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis*.[48] Here the plural suffix *-n* on the verb *have* is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*, and Thomas Malory's *Le Morte d'Arthur*. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.[49]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early Modern English\n\n![](image)Graphic representation of the Great Vowel Shift showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level\nThe next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.\n\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word *bite* was originally pronounced as the word *beet* is today, and the second vowel in the word *about* was pronounced as the word *boot* is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.[50][51]\n\n\nEnglish began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.[52] Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in *knight*, *gnat*, and *sword* were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.[53]\n\n\nIn the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says, \"The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests.\"[43] This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with subject–verb–object word order, and the use of *of* instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (*ayre*) and word replacements (*bird* originally meaning \"nestling\" had replaced OE *fugol*).[43]\n\n\n\n### Spread of Modern English[edit]\n\n\nBy the late 18th century, the British Empire had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.[54][4] English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.[55][56][57] In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC[58] and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.[59][60] In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.[61]\n\n\nAs Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his *A Dictionary of the English Language*, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the *American Dictionary of the English language* to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.[62]\n\n\nIn modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as *he* and *him*, *she* and *her*, *who* and *whom*), and SVO word order is mostly fixed.[62] Some changes, such as the use of do-support, have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word \"do\" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.[63] Now, do-support with the verb *have* is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in *-ing*, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as *had been being built* are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. *dreamed* instead of *dreamt*), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. *more polite* instead of *politer*). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the United States as a world power.[64][65][66]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and territories where English is an official language, List of countries by English-speaking population, and English-speaking world\n\n![](image)Percentage of native speakers of English and English creoles globally as of 2017\n![](image)Majority native language\n Co-official and majority native language\n Official but minority native language\n Secondary language: spoken as a second language by more than 20% of the population, *de facto* working language of government, language of instruction in education, etc.\n\n![](image)Percentage of Americans aged 5+ speaking English at home in each Microdata Area (PUMA) of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, according to the 2016–2021 five-year American Community Survey\nAs of 2016[update], 400 million people spoke English as their first language, and 1.1 billion spoke it as a secondary language.[67] English is the largest language by number of speakers. English is spoken by communities on every continent and on islands in all the major oceans.[68]\n\n\nThe countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country. The \"inner circle\"[69] countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n### Three circles of English-speaking countries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of London residents for whom English was their primary language as of 2021\n![Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English](image)Braj Kachru's *Three Circles of English*\nThe Indian linguist Braj Kachru distinguished countries where English is spoken with a three circles model.[69] In his model,\n\n\n\n* the \"inner circle\" countries have large communities of native speakers of English,\n* \"outer circle\" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and\n* \"expanding circle\" countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language.\n\n\nKachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.[70]\n\n\nCountries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231 million),[71] the United Kingdom (60 million),[72][73][74] Canada (19 million),[75] Australia (at least 17 million),[76] South Africa (4.8 million),[77] Ireland (4.2 million), and New Zealand (3.7 million).[78] In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.[79] The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.[70]\n\n\nEstimates of the numbers of second language and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1 billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.[9] Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.[80] In Kachru's three-circles model, the \"outer circle\" countries are countries such as the Philippines,[81] Jamaica,[82] India, Pakistan, Singapore,[83] Malaysia and Nigeria[84][85] with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.[86]\n\n\nThose countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.[79] Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,[79] and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.[79]\n\n\nIn the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the \"expanding circle\".[87] The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.[86] For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,[88] and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the \"outer circle\" and \"expanding circle\". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.[89]\n\n\nMany users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use the language.[90] Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.[91] Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries. This is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences.[92]\n\n\n\n### Pluricentric English[edit]\n\n\nPie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in \"inner circle\" English-speaking countries. Native speakers are now substantially outnumbered worldwide by second-language speakers of English (not counted in this chart).\n\n\n\nUS (64.3%)\nUK (16.7%)\nCanada (5.3%)\nAustralia (4.7%)\nSouth Africa (1.3%)\nIreland (1.1%)\nNew Zealand (1%)\nOther (5.6%)\n\nEnglish is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.[93][94][95][96] Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents,[97] but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.[98]\n\n\nAmerican listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.[99] Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.[100]\n\n\nThe settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.[101] The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,[71][102] and English has been given official or co-official status by 30 of the 50 state governments, as well as all five territorial governments of the US, though there has never been an official language at the federal level.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### English as a global language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English as a lingua franca\n\nSee also: Foreign-language influences in English and Study of global communication\n\n![](image)Countries in which English language is a mandatory or an optional subject[105]English is a mandatory subject\nEnglish is an optional subject\nNo data\n\nEnglish has ceased to be an \"English language\" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.[106][107] Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.[108] Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an \"Afro-Saxon\" language community that unites Africans from different countries.[109]\n\n\nAs decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.[56][57][110] For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.[111] English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.[112] However, English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.[113][114] David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,[115] but the number of English speakers in India is uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.[116]\n\n\nModern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,[59][117] is also regarded as the first world language.[118][119] English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.[119] English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages[120] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[121] and aviation.[122] English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.[123] It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.[124] By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent[125] and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.[126] It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[127] Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.\n\n\nMany regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),[60] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.[128]\n\n\nAlthough in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.[59][60] In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.[129]\n\n\nA working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine[130] and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by *Chemical Abstracts* in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.[131]\n\n\nInternational communities such as international business people may use English as an auxiliary language, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.[132] Other examples include Simple English.\n\n\nThe increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death,[133] and to claims of linguistic imperialism,[134] and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.[135]\n\n\nAlthough some scholars[*who?*] mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.[136] English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.[137] Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English phonology\n\nThe phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.[140] This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States: Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA). (See § Dialects, accents and varieties, below.)\n\n\nThe phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Consonants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English phonology § Consonants\n\nMost English dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes. The consonant inventory shown below is valid for California English,[144] and for RP.[145]\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonant phonemes\n|  | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasal |  | m |  |  | n |  |  |  | ŋ |  |\n| Plosive | p | b |  | t | d |  |  |  | k | ɡ |  |\n| Affricate |  |  |  |  |  | tʃ | dʒ |  |  |  |  |\n| Fricative | f | v | θ | ð | s | z | ʃ | ʒ |  |  | h |  |\n| Approximant |  |  |  |  |  | ɹ\\*\n |  | j |  | w |  |\n| Lateral approx. |  |  | l |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n\\* Conventionally transcribed /r/\n\n\nIn the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as /p b/, /tʃ dʒ/, and /s z/, the first is fortis (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p tʃ s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as /b dʒ z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [pʰ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p̚] or pre-glottalised [ʔp] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus *nip* has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than *nib* [nɪˑb̥] (see below).[146]\n\n\n\n* lenis stops: *bin* [b̥ɪˑn], *about* [əˈbaʊt], *nib* [nɪˑb̥]\n* fortis stops: *pin* [pʰɪn]; *spin* [spɪn]; *happy* [ˈhæpi]; *nip* [nɪp̚] or [nɪʔp]\n\n\nIn RP, the lateral approximant /l/, has two main allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in *light*, and the dark or velarised [ɫ], as in *full*.[147] GA has dark *l* in most cases.[148]\n\n\n\n* clear *l*: RP *light* [laɪt]\n* dark *l*: RP and GA *full* [fʊɫ], GA *light* [ɫaɪt]\n\n\nAll sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, ŋ/) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.[149]\n\n\n\n* voiceless sonorants: *clay* [kl̥eɪ̯]; *snow* RP [sn̥əʊ̯], GA [sn̥oʊ̯]\n* syllabic sonorants: *paddle* [ˈpad.l̩], *button* [ˈbʌt.n̩]\n\n\n### Vowels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English phonology § Vowels\n\nThe pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.[150]\n\n\n\n\n\nMonophthongs\n| RP | GA | Word\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| iː | i | n**ee**d\n |\n| ɪ | b**i**d\n |\n| e | ɛ | b**e**d\n |\n| æ | b**a**ck\n |\n| ɑː | ɑ | br**a** |\n| ɒ | b**o**x\n |\n| ɔ, ɑ | cl**o**th\n |\n| ɔː | p**aw** |\n| uː | u | f**oo**d\n |\n| ʊ | g**oo**d\n |\n| ʌ | b**u**t\n |\n| ɜː | ɜɹ | b**ir**d\n |\n| ə | comm**a** |\n\n\nClosing diphthongs\n| RP | GA | Word\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| eɪ | b**ay** |\n| əʊ | oʊ | r**oa**d\n |\n| aɪ | cr**y** |\n| aʊ | c**ow** |\n| ɔɪ | b**oy** |\n\n\n\n\nCentring diphthongs\n| RP | GA | Word\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ɪə | ɪɹ | p**eer** |\n| eə | ɛɹ | p**air** |\n| ʊə | ʊɹ | p**oor** |\n\n\nIn RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon ⟨ː⟩ in the table above, such as the vowel of *need* [niːd] as opposed to *bid* [bɪd]. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.\n\n\nIn both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t tʃ f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d dʒ v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of *rich* [rɪtʃ], *neat* [nit], and *safe* [seɪ̯f] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of *ridge* [rɪˑdʒ], *need* [niˑd], and *save* [seˑɪ̯v], and the vowel of *light* [laɪ̯t] is shorter than that of *lie* [laˑɪ̯]. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.[151]\n\n\nThe vowel /ə/ only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.[152][153] Some dialects do not contrast /ɪ/ and /ə/ in unstressed positions, so that *rabbit* and *abbot* rhyme and *Lenin* and *Lennon* are homophonous, a dialect feature called weak vowel merger.[154] GA /ɜr/ and /ər/ are realised as an *r*-coloured vowel [ɚ], as in *further* [ˈfɚðɚ] (phonemically /ˈfɜrðər/), which in RP is realised as [ˈfəːðə] (phonemically /ˈfɜːðə/).[155]\n\n\n\n### Phonotactics[edit]\n\n\nAn English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in *sprint* /sprɪnt/, and end with up to five, as in (for some dialects) *angsts* /aŋksts/. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCCC), where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word *strengths* /strɛŋkθs/ is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in *play*; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in *fly* or *sly*; *s* and a voiceless stop, as in *stay*; and *s*, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in *string*.[156] Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable-initial position, and /ŋ/ only in syllable-final position.[157]\n\n\n\n### Stress, rhythm and intonation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stress and vowel reduction in English and Intonation (linguistics) § English\n\nStress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.[158] Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as *can*, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.\n\n\nStress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word *contract* is stressed on the first syllable (/ˈkɒntrækt/ *KON-trakt*) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/kənˈtrækt/ *kən-TRAKT*) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb.[159][160][161] Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /ə/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. *a burnout* (/ˈbɜːrnaʊt/) versus *to burn out* (/ˈbɜːrn ˈaʊt/), and *a hotdog* (/ˈhɒtdɒɡ/) versus *a hot dog* (/ˈhɒt ˈdɒɡ/).[162]\n\n\nIn terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.[163] Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.[164]\n\n\n\n### Regional variation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nVarieties of Standard English and their features[165]\n| Phonologicalfeatures | UnitedStates | Canada | Republicof Ireland | NorthernIreland | Scotland | England | Wales | SouthAfrica | Australia | NewZealand |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *father*–*bother* merger | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| /ɒ/ is unrounded | yes | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| /ɜːr/ is pronounced [ɚ] | yes | yes | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *cot*–*caught* merger | possibly | yes | possibly | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *fool*–*full* merger |  |  |  | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |\n| /t, d/ flapping | yes | yes | possibly | often | rarely | rarely | rarely | rarely | yes | often\n |\n| *trap*–*bath* split |  |  | possibly | possibly |  | often | yes | yes | often | yes\n |\n| non-rhotic (/r/-dropping after vowels)\n |  |  |  |  |  | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes\n |\n| close vowels for /æ, ɛ/ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | yes | yes | yes\n |\n| /l/ can always be pronounced [ɫ] | yes | yes |  | yes | yes |  |  |  | yes | yes\n |\n| /ɑːr/ is fronted |  | possibly | possibly |  |  |  |  |  | yes | yes\n |\n\n\n\n\nDialects and low vowels\n| Lexical set | RP | GA | Can | Sound change\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| THOUGHT | /ɔː/ | /ɔ/ or /ɑ/ | /ɑ/ | *cot*–*caught* merger |\n| CLOTH | /ɒ/ | *lot*–*cloth* split |\n| LOT | /ɑ/ | *father*–*bother* merger |\n| PALM | /ɑː/ |\n| BATH | /æ/ | /æ/ | *trap*–*bath* split |\n| TRAP | /æ/ |\n\n\nVarieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table \"Varieties of Standard English and their features\".[165]\n\n\nEnglish has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.[166]\n\n\nSome dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless [ʍ] sound in *whine* that contrasts with the voiced [w] in *wine*, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w], a dialect feature called *wine*–*whine* merger. The unvoiced velar fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes *loch* /lɔx/ from *lock* /lɔk/. Accents like Cockney with \"*h*-dropping\" lack the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with *th*-stopping and *th*-fronting like African-American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives /θ, ð/, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.[167][168] Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as *yod*-dropping, *yod*-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.[169][*page needed*]\n\n\nGeneral American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.[170]\n\n\nThere is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels /æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three /æ ɑ ɔ/,[171] and in Canadian English, they merge to two /æ ɑ/.[172] In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table \"Dialects and open vowels\" shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English grammar\n\nAs is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.[173] English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as *have* and *do*, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with *wh*-) and word order inversion with some verbs.[174]\n\n\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs *speak/spoke* and *foot/feet*) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as *love/loved*, *hand/hands*).[175] Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (*he/him, who/whom*) and in the inflection of the copula verb *to be*.[175]\n\n\nThe seven word-classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:[176]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *The* | *chairman* | *of* | *the* | *committee* | *and* | *the* | *loquacious* | *politician* | *clashed* | *violently* | *when* | *the* | *meeting* | *started*.\n |\n| Det. | Noun | Prep. | Det. | Noun | Conj. | Det. | Adj. | Noun | Verb | Advb. | Conj. | Det. | Noun | Verb\n |\n\n\n### Nouns and noun phrases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English nouns\n\nEnglish nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.[177]\n\n\nMost count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -*s*, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. *one loaf of bread*, *two loaves of bread*.[178]\n\n\nRegular plural formation:\n\n\n\n* Singular: *cat, dog*\n* Plural: *cats, dogs*\n\n\nIrregular plural formation:\n\n\n\n* Singular: *man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse*\n* Plural: *men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice*\n\n\nPossession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -*s* (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition *of*. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the *of* possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -*s* also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe. If the noun is plural formed with -s the apostrophe follows the -s.[174]\n\n\nPossessive constructions:\n\n\n\n* With -s: *The woman's husband's child*\n* With of: *The child of the husband of the woman*\n\n\nNouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.[179] Noun phrases can be short, such as *the man*, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. *red*, *tall*, *all*) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. *the*, *that*). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as *and*, or prepositions such as *with*, e.g. *the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles* (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.[174] For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in *The President of India's wife*, where the enclitic follows *India* and not *President*.\n\n\nThe class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where *the* marks a definite noun and *a* or *an* an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include *one*, *many*, *some* and *all*, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. *one man* (sg.) but *all men* (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.[180]\n\n\n\n#### Adjectives[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English adjectives\n\nEnglish adjectives are words such as *good*, *big*, *interesting,* and *Canadian* that most typically modify nouns, denoting characteristics of their referents (e.g., *a red car*). As modifiers, they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.[181] English adjectives also function as predicative complements (e.g., *the child is happy*).\n\n\nIn Modern English, adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases *the slender boy*, and *many slender girls*, the adjective *slender* does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.\n\n\nSome adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix *-er* marking the comparative, and *-est* marking the superlative: *a small boy*, *the boy is smaller than the girl*, *that boy is the smallest*. Some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms, such as *good*, *better*, and *best*. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb *more* marking the comparative, and *most* marking the superlative: *happier* or *more happy*, *the happiest* or *most happy*.[182] There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.[183]\n\n\n\n#### Determiners[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English determiners\n\nEnglish determiners are words such as *the*, *each*, *many*, *some*, and *which*, occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite.[184] They often agree with the noun in number. They do not typically inflect for degree of comparison.\n\n\n\n#### Pronouns, case, and person[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English pronouns\n\nEnglish pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (*I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them*) as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing *it* from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns) and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular (distinguishing between *she/her* [feminine], *they/them* [epicene], and *he/him* [masculine]).[185][186] The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case (for a patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and of the Old English dative case (for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb).[187][188] The subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, otherwise the objective is used.[189] While grammarians such as Henry Sweet[190] and Otto Jespersen[191] noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin-based system, some contemporary grammars, for example Huddleston & Pullum (2002), retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.\n\n\nPossessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in *my chair*), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. *the chair is mine*).[192] The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old second person singular familiar pronoun *thou* acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned).\n\n\nBoth the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular:\n\n\n\n* Plural and singular are always identical (*you*, *your*, *yours*) in the second person (except in the reflexive form: *yourself/yourselves*) in most dialects. Some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns, such as *y'all* (found in Southern American English and African-American (Vernacular) English), *youse* (found in Australian English), or *ye* (in Hiberno-English).\n* In the third person, the *they/them* series of pronouns (*they*, *them*, *their*, *theirs*, *themselves*) are used in both plural and singular, and are the only pronouns available for the plural. In the singular, the *they/them* series (sometimes with the addition of the singular-specific reflexive form *themself*) serve as a gender-neutral set of pronouns. These pronouns are becoming more accepted as part of the LGBT culture.[185][193][194]\n\n\n\n\nEnglish personal pronouns\n| Person | Subjective case | Objective case | Dependent possessive | Independent possessive | Reflexive\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st, singular\n | *I* | *me* | *my* | *mine* | *myself* |\n| 2nd, singular\n | *you* | *you* | *your* | *yours* | *yourself* |\n| 3rd, singular\n | *he/she/it/they* | *him/her/it/them* | *his/her/its/their* | *his/hers/its/theirs* | *himself/herself/itself/themself/themselves* |\n| 1st, plural\n | *we* | *us* | *our* | *ours* | *ourselves* |\n| 2nd, plural\n | *you* | *you* | *your* | *yours* | *yourselves* |\n| 3rd, plural\n | *they* | *them* | *their* | *theirs* | *themselves* |\n\n\nPronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun *I* identifies the speaker, and the pronoun *you*, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as *that* refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence *I already told you that*. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. \"he sent it to himself\" or \"she braced herself for impact\").[195]\n\n\n\n#### Prepositions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. *with the dog*, *for my friend*, *to school*, *in England*.[196] Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.[196] For example, in the phrase *I gave it to him*, the preposition *to* marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb *to give*. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\". But some contemporary grammars such as that of Huddleston & Pullum (2002:598–600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Verbs and verb phrases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English verbs\n\nEnglish verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb *to be* is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.[182] Auxiliary verbs such as *have* and *be* are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.[197][198]\n\n\nMost verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.[199] The copula verb *to be* is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is *am*, the third person singular form is *is*, and the form *are* is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is *been* and its gerund-participle is *being*.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish inflectional forms\n| Inflection | Strong | Regular\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Plain present\n | *take* | *love* |\n| 3rd person sg.present\n | *takes* | *loves* |\n| Preterite\n | *took* | *loved* |\n| Plain (infinitive)\n | *take* | *love* |\n| Gerund–participle\n | *taking* | *loving* |\n| Past participle\n | *taken* | *loved* |\n\n\n#### Tense, aspect and mood[edit]\n\n\nEnglish has two primary tenses, past (preterite) and non-past. The preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix *-ed*, and for the strong verbs either the suffix *-t* or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix *-s*.[197]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Present | Preterite\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First person\n | *I run* | *I ran* |\n| Second person\n | *You run* | *You ran* |\n| Third person\n | *John runs* | *John ran* |\n\n\nEnglish does not have future verb forms.[200] The future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs *will* or *shall*.[201] Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb *be going to* (\"going-to future\").[202]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Future\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| First person\n | *I will run* |\n| Second person\n | *You will run* |\n| Third person\n | *John will run* |\n\n\nFurther aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs, primarily *have* and *be*, which show the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (*I have run* vs. *I was running*), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (*I had been running*) and present perfect (*I have been running*).[203]\n\n\nFor the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as *can*, *may*, *will*, *shall* and the past tense forms *could*, *might*, *would*, *should*. There are also subjunctive and imperative moods, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular *-s*), for use in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: *It is important that he run every day*; imperative *Run!*).[201]\n\n\nAn infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition *to*, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.[204] For example, *he has to go* where only the auxiliary verb *have* is inflected for time and the main verb *to go* is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as *I saw him leave*, where the main verb is *see*, which is in a preterite form, and *leave* is in the infinitive.\n\n\n\n#### Phrasal verbs[edit]\n\n\nEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are *to get up*, *to ask out*, *to back up*, *to give up*, *to get together*, *to hang out*, *to put up with*, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. *lay off* meaning *terminate someone's employment*).[205] In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston & Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. *he woke up in the morning* and *he ran up in the mountains* are syntactically equivalent.\n\n\n\n#### Adverbs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English adverbs\n\nThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.[174] Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix *-ly*. For example, in the phrase *the woman walked quickly*, the adverb *quickly* is derived in this way from the adjective *quick*. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as *good*, which has the adverbial form *well*.\n\n\n\n### Syntax[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the English sentence *The cat sat on the mat*, the subject is *the cat* (a noun phrase), the verb is \"sat\", and \"on the mat\" is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase \"the mat\", headed by the preposition \"on\".\nModern English syntax language is moderately analytic.[206] It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.\n\n\n\n#### Basic constituent order[edit]\n\n\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object (SVO).[207] The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as *he had hoped to try to open it*.\n\n\nIn most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.[208] The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *The dog* | *bites* | *the man* |\n| S | V | O\n |\n| *The man* | *bites* | *the dog* |\n| S | V | O\n |\n\n\nAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.[209] The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *He* | *hit* | *him* |\n| S | V | O\n |\n\n\nIndirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as *I gave Jane the book* or in a prepositional phrase, such as *I gave the book to Jane*.[210]\n\n\n\n#### Clause syntax[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English clause syntax\n\nIn English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase *I think (that) you are lying*, the main clause is headed by the verb *think*, the subject is *I*, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause *(that) you are lying*. The subordinating conjunction *that* shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.[211] Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence *I saw the letter that you received today*, the relative clause *that you received today* specifies the meaning of the word *letter*, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns *who*, *whose*, *whom* and *which* as well as by *that* (which can also be omitted.)[212] In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.[213]\n\n\n\n#### Auxiliary verb constructions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Do-support, English auxiliary verbs, and Subject–auxiliary inversion\n\nEnglish syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence *the dog did not find its bone*, the clause *find its bone* is the complement of the negated verb *did not*. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.\n\n\nThe verb *do* can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I *did* shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb *not* to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *\\*I know not*—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary *do* is used, to produce a form like *I do not (don't) know.* The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *\\*Know you him?*; grammatical rules require *Do you know him?*[214]\n\n\nNegation is done with the adverb *not*, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not *-n't* can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb *to be*. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English *I don't know him* is the correct answer to the question *Do you know him?*, but not *\\*I know him not*, although this construction may be found in older English.[215]\n\n\nPassive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb *to be* or *to get*, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with *get*. For example, putting the sentence *she sees him* into the passive becomes *he is seen (by her)*, or *he gets seen (by her)*.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Questions[edit]\n\n\nBoth yes–no questions and *wh*-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (*Am I going tomorrow?*, *Where can we eat?*), which may require *do*-support (*Do you like her?*, *Where did he go?*). In most cases, interrogative words (*wh*-words; e.g. *what*, *who*, *where*, *when*, *why*, *how*) appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question *What did you see?*, the word *what* appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the *wh*-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: *Who saw the cat?*.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. *To whose house did you go last night?*. The personal interrogative pronoun *who* is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant *whom* serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.[217]\n\n\n\n#### Discourse level syntax[edit]\n\n\nWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, *the girl was stung by the bee*. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as *it* or *there*, e.g. *it was the girl that the bee stung*, *there was a girl who was stung by a bee*.[218] Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., *it is raining*) or in existential clauses (*there are many cars on the street*). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.\n\n\nFocus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, *the girl was stung by a bee* (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or *The girl was stung by a bee* (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).[219] Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, *That girl over there, she was stung by a bee*, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, *she was stung by a bee, that girl over there*, where reference to the girl is established as an \"afterthought\".[220]\n\n\nCohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. *that is exactly what I mean* where *that* refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or *then* used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).[221] Discourse markers such as *oh*, *so* or *well*, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, *no way is that true!* (the idiomatic marker *no way!* expressing disbelief), or *boy! I'm hungry* (the marker *boy* expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.[222]\n\n\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign-language influences in English\n\nIt is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the *Oxford English Dictionary* from 1989.[223] Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.[224]\n\n\nDue to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,[225] collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.[224][226]\n\n\n\n### Word formation processes[edit]\n\n\nEnglish forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,[227] using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,[224][226] producing compound words such as *babysitter* or *ice cream* or *homesick*.[227] A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (*-hood*, *-ness*, *-ing*, *-ility*) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin).\n\n\nFormation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example *television* or *optometry*) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, American lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the \"international scientific vocabulary\" (ISV) when compiling *Webster's Third New International Dictionary* (1961). Another active word-formation process in English are acronyms,[228] words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases, e.g. *NATO*, *laser*.\n\n\n\n### Word origins[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign-language influences in English and Lists of English words by country or language of origin\n\nSee also: Linguistic purism in English\n\nSource languages of the English vocabulary[11][229]\n\n\n\nLatin (29%)\n(Old) French, including Anglo-French (29%)\nGermanic languages (Old/Middle English, Old Norse, Dutch) (26%)\nGreek (6%)\nOther languages/unknown (6%)\nDerived from proper names (4%)\n\nEnglish, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This borrowing is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.[230] Nevertheless, most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in English are still West Germanic.[231][232] The English words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly Germanic words from Old English.[224] It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words, but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords.[233]\n\n\nBut one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of \"Latinate\" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.[234] Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers.[235] Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as *egg* and *knife*.[236]\n\n\nEnglish has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.[226][224] Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.[237] English continues to gain new loanwords and calques (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.[238]\n\n\nEnglish has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.[239][240]\n\n\n\n### English loanwords and calques in other languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Englishization\n\nEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.[234][241] The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world *lingua franca*, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.[242] That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.[243] Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.[244] Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.[244]\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: English alphabet, English Braille, and English orthography\n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.[37] The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n\nThe spelling system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered and complex, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.[245] Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.[50] Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.[246] There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.[247]\n\n\nAlthough letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.[248] Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling — for example, the words *photograph*, *photography*, and *photographic*,[248] or the words *electricity* and *electrical*. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",[245] there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.[249] The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.[250] Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.[251]\n\n\nReaders of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters *b*, *d*, *f*, *h*, *j*, *k*, *l*, *m*, *n*, *p*, *r*, *s*, *t*, *v*, *w*, *y*, *z* represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters *c* and *g* normally represent /k/ and /ɡ/, but there is also a soft *c* pronounced /s/, and a soft *g* pronounced /dʒ/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters *c* and *g* are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include *ch* for /tʃ/, *sh* for /ʃ/, *th* for /θ/ or /ð/, *ng* for /ŋ/, *qu* for /kw/, and *ph* for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter *x* is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin[248] or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.[252]\n\n\nFor the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (*a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*, *w*, *y*). As a result, some \"long vowels\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the *oa* in *boat*, the *ow* in *how*, and the *ay* in *stay*), or the historically based silent *e* (as in *note* and *cake*).[249]\n\n\nThe consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.[253] Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.[248] Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.[254][255] Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.[256]\n\n\nEnglish writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.[257]\n\n\n\n## Dialects, accents and varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of dialects of English, World Englishes, and regional accents of English\n\nDialectologists identify many English dialects, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE).[258] There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.\n\n\n\n### Britain and Ireland[edit]\n\n\nSee also: English language in England, Estuary English, Northern England English, Welsh English, Scottish English, Scots language, Hiberno-English, and Ulster English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a man with a Received Pronunciation accent (Gyles Brandreth).\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.[260]\n\n\nNonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary. In fact, only 3% of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.[261] There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.[262] Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class; some traits, though exceedingly common, are nonetheless considered \"non-standard\" and associated with lower-class speakers and identities. An example of this is *h*-dropping, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England. However, it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.[263]\n\n\nEnglish in England can be divided into four major dialect regions: Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions, several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.[264]\n\n\nSince the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the South East led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.[265][266][267] Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (*drawing* is pronounced *drawring* /ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/), *t*-glottalisation (*Potter* is pronounced with a glottal stop as *Po'er* /ˈpɒʔə/) and the pronunciation of *th-* as /f/ (*thanks* pronounced *fanks*) or /v/ (*bother* pronounced *bover*).[268]\n\n\nScots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English[269] and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. In addition to Scots, Scottish English comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.[270]\n\n\nIn Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.[18][271]\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American English, General American, Southern American English, African-American Vernacular English, Canadian English, and Atlantic Canadian English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a Midwestern U.S. male with a General American accent (Emery Emery).\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.[278]\n\n\nThe English language is far and away the most widely used language in the United States. Its roots trace back to the British colonial era, which began with the settlement in present-day Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. While German was the predominant language among German immigrants, who arrived primarily in eastern Pennsylvania, English was ultimately widely adopted throughout the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately launched both the American Revolution and American Revolutionary War against the Kingdom of Great Britain, then rules by King George III and establishing the United States as an independent sovereign nation in September 1783.\n\n\nSeparate from the General American English are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems that have developed over time, including Southern American English, English of the coastal Northeastern United States, including Eastern New England English, New York City English, and African-American Vernacular English, all of which are historically non-rhotic. Canadian English varieties, except for those of the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec, are also classified as General American English, although they often show raising of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ before voiceless consonants and have distinct written and pronunciation norms as well.[279]\n\n\nIn Southern American English, the most populous American \"accent group\" outside of the General American English,[280] rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige.[281][282][283] Southern accents are colloquially described as a \"drawl\" or \"twang\",[284] being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /aɪ/ vowel (e.g. pronouncing *spy* almost like *spa*), the \"Southern breaking\" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word \"press\" almost like \"pray-us\"),[285] the pin–pen merger, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.[286]\n\n\nSpoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,[287] contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.[288] AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of \"broken\" or \"uneducated\" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities.[289][290]\n\n\n\n### Australia and New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian English and New Zealand English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a male with a general Australian accent.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.[291] Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely with British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in *the government is* rather than *are*).[292][293] New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.[294][295][296]\n\n\n\n### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Southeast Asian English, Philippine English, Singapore English, Malaysian English, and Brunei English\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: details on Southeast Asian varieties other than Philippine English.

English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946 and remains an official language of the Philippines. Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, being found on street signs and marquees, in government documents and forms, in courtrooms, in the media and entertainment industries, in the business sector, and in various other aspects of daily life.[297] One particularly prominent form of English usage in the country is found in everyday speech: most Filipinos from Manila use or, at the very least, have been exposed to Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English.[298] A similar code-switching method is used by urban native speakers of Bisayan languages under the name of Bislish.\n\n\n\n### Africa, the Caribbean, and South Asia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: South African English, Nigerian English, Caribbean English, Indian English, Pakistani English, and Bangladeshi English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a male with a South African accent.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about 9 percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.[299] Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.[300] Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. *pin* pronounced [pɪn] rather than as [pʰɪn] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [ɾ] instead of as the more common fricative.[301]\n\n\nNigerian English is a dialect of English spoken in Nigeria.[302] It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. *senior wife*). Over 150 million Nigerians speak English.[303]\n\n\nSeveral varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English-based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.[304] Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as \"basilect\" and the more RP-like forms serving as the \"acrolect\", the most formal register.[305]\n\n\nMost Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [eː] and [oː] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. *bay* and *boat* pronounced [bʲeː] and [bʷoːt]). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced [t͡ʃail] and \"wind\" [win].[306][307][308]\n\n\nAs a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [ʈ] and [ɖ]) and the replacement of /θ/ and /ð/ with dentals [t̪] and [d̪]. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling-based pronunciations where the silent ⟨h⟩ found in words such as *ghost* is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [ɡʱ].[309]\n\n\n\n### Non-native varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Non-native pronunciations of English\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Modern English is both the most spoken language in the world[7] and the third-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.[8] It is also the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers.\n\n\nEnglish is either the official language or one of the official languages in 59 sovereign states (such as in India, Ireland, and Canada). In some other countries, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law (such as in the United States or United Kingdom).[9] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. English accounts for at least 70% of total speakers of the Germanic language branch, and as of 2005, it was estimated that there were over two billion speakers worldwide.[10]\n\n\nOld English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language.[11][12][13] Then, Middle English borrowed words extensively from French dialects, which make up about 28% of Modern English words, and from Latin, which also provides about 28%.[14] Thus, although most of its vocabulary now comes from Romance languages, its grammar, phonology, and most commonly-used words keep it genealogically classified under the Germanic branch. English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots and then is most closely related to the Low Saxon and Frisian languages.\n\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)**Anglic languages** English\n Scots\n within the **Anglo-Frisian languages**, which also include Frisian (West, North, Saterland);\n within the **North Sea Germanic languages**, which also include Low German/Saxon;\n within the **West Germanic languages**, which also include Dutch in Europe and Afrikaans in Africa\n ...... German (High): Central; in Lux.: Luxembourgish\n Upper\n ...... Yiddish\n![](image)A family tree of the West Germanic language family\nEnglish is an Indo-European language and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.[15] Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the Frisian North Sea coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the Anglic languages in the British Isles, and into the Frisian languages and Low German/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the Anglo-Frisian languages, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.[12] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.[16] Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots[17] and the extinct Fingallian dialect and Yola language of Ireland.[18]\n\n\nLike Icelandic and Faroese, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and it has since diverged considerably. English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.[19]\n\n\nUnlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly Old Norse and Norman French. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic clades—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a mixed language or a creole—a theory called the Middle English creole hypothesis. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.[20][21]\n\n\nEnglish is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages such as Dutch, German, and Swedish.[22] These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the palatalisation of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see Phonological history of Old English § Palatalization).[23]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of English\n\n### Overview of history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest varieties of an English language, collectively known as Old English or \"Anglo-Saxon\", evolved from a group of North Sea Germanic dialects brought to Britain in the 5th century. Old English dialects were later influenced by Old Norse-speaking Viking settlers and invaders, starting in the 8th and 9th centuries. Middle English began in the late 11th century after the Norman Conquest of England, when considerable Old French, especially Old Norman French, and Latin-derived vocabulary was incorporated into English over some three hundred years.[24][25]\n\n\nEarly Modern English began in the late 15th century with the start of the Great Vowel Shift and the Renaissance trend of borrowing further Latin and Greek words and roots, concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to London. This era notably culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.[26][27] The printing press greatly standardised English spelling,[*citation needed*] which has remained largely unchanged since then, despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in English dialects.\n\n\nModern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States. Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the *lingua franca* in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation, and law.[4] Its modern grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order.[28] Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspects and moods, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives, and some negation.\n\n\n\n### Proto-Germanic to Old English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Old English\n\n![](image)The opening of *Beowulf*, an Old English epic poem handwritten in half-uncial script between 975 AD and 1025 AD: *Hƿæt ƿē Gārde/na ingēar dagum þēod cyninga / þrym ge frunon...* (\"Listen! We of the Spear-Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk-kings...\")\nThe earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066). Old English developed from a set of West Germanic dialects, often grouped as Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic, and originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony and southern Jutland by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.[29] From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the 7th century, this Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and British Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.[30][31][32] At this time, these dialects generally resisted influence from the then-local Brittonic and Latin languages. *England* and *English* (originally *Ænglaland* and *Ænglisc*) are both named after the Angles.[33]\n\n\nOld English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects (Mercian and Northumbrian) and the Saxon dialects, Kentish and West Saxon.[34] Through the educational reforms of King Alfred in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of Wessex, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety.[35] The epic poem *Beowulf* is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, *Cædmon's Hymn*, is written in Northumbrian.[36] Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a runic script.[37] By the 6th century, a Latin alphabet was adopted, written with half-uncial letterforms. It included the runic letters *wynn* ⟨*ƿ*⟩ and *thorn* ⟨*þ*⟩, and the modified Latin letters *eth* ⟨*ð*⟩, and *ash* ⟨*æ*⟩.[37][38]\n\n\nOld English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German: nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (*he*, *him*, *his*) and has a few verb inflections (*speak*, *speaks*, *speaking*, *spoke*, *spoken*), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.[39][40][41] Its closest relative is Old Frisian, but even some centuries after the Anglo-Saxon migration, Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility with other Germanic varieties. Even in the 9th and 10th centuries, amidst the Danelaw and other Viking invasions, there is historical evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility,[42] although probably the northern dialects of Old English were more similar to Old Norse than the southern dialects. Theoretically, as late as the 900s AD, a commoner from certain (northern) parts of England could hold a conversation with a commoner from certain parts of Scandinavia. Research continues into the details of the myriad tribes in peoples in England and Scandinavia and the mutual contacts between them.[42]\n\n\nThe translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 shows examples of case endings (nominative plural, accusative plural, genitive singular) and a verb ending (present plural):\n\n\n\n* *Foxas habbað holu and heofonan fuglas nest*\n* Fox-as habb-að hol-u and heofon-an fugl-as nest-∅\n* fox-NOM.PL have-PRS.PL hole-ACC.PL and heaven-GEN.SG bird-NOM.PL nest-ACC.PL\n* \"Foxes have holes and the birds of heaven nests\"[43]\n\n\n### Influence of Old Norse[edit]\n\n\nFrom the 8th to the 11th centuries, Old English gradually transformed through language contact with Old Norse in some regions. The waves of Norse (Viking) colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. The centre of norsified English was in the Midlands around Lindsey. After 920 CE, when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, English spread extensively throughout the region.\n\n\nAn element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with *th-* (*they, them, their*) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with *h-* (*hie, him, hera*).[44] Other core Norse loanwords include \"give\", \"get\", \"sky\", \"skirt\", \"egg\", and \"cake\", typically displacing a native Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English, particularly northern ones.\n\n\n\n### Middle English[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Middle English and Influence of French on English\n\n![](image)The University of Oxford in Oxford, the world's oldest English-speaking university and world's second-oldest university, founded in 1096\n![](image)The University of Cambridge in Cambridge, the world's second-oldest English-speaking university and world's third-oldest university, founded in 1209\n> \n> *Englischmen þeyz hy hadde fram þe bygynnyng þre manner speche, Souþeron, Northeron, and Myddel speche in þe myddel of þe lond, ...

Old Norman French in England eventually developed into Anglo-Norman.[24] Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking English, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.[13] Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,[46] and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.[47]\n\n\nIn Wycliff'e Bible of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written: *Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis*.[48] Here the plural suffix *-n* on the verb *have* is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*, and Thomas Malory's *Le Morte d'Arthur*. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.[49]\n\n\n\n### Early Modern English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early Modern English\n\n![](image)Graphic representation of the Great Vowel Shift showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level\nThe next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.\n\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word *bite* was originally pronounced as the word *beet* is today, and the second vowel in the word *about* was pronounced as the word *boot* is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.[50][51]\n\n\nEnglish began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.[52] Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the translation of the Bible commissioned by King James I. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in *knight*, *gnat*, and *sword* were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.[53]\n\n\nIn the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says, \"The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests.\"[43] This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with subject–verb–object word order, and the use of *of* instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (*ayre*) and word replacements (*bird* originally meaning \"nestling\" had replaced OE *fugol*).[43]\n\n\n\n### Spread of Modern English[edit]\n\n\nBy the late 18th century, the British Empire had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.[54][4] English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.[55][56][57] In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC[58] and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.[59][60] In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.[61]\n\n\nAs Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his *A Dictionary of the English Language*, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the *American Dictionary of the English language* to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.[62]\n\n\nIn modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as *he* and *him*, *she* and *her*, *who* and *whom*), and SVO word order is mostly fixed.[62] Some changes, such as the use of do-support, have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word \"do\" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.[63] Now, do-support with the verb *have* is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in *-ing*, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as *had been being built* are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. *dreamed* instead of *dreamt*), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. *more polite* instead of *politer*). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the United States as a world power.[64][65][66]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and territories where English is an official language, List of countries by English-speaking population, and English-speaking world\n\n![](image)Percentage of native speakers of English and English creoles globally as of 2017\n![](image)Majority native language\n Co-official and majority native language\n Official but minority native language\n Secondary language: spoken as a second language by more than 20% of the population, *de facto* working language of government, language of instruction in education, etc.\n\n![](image)Percentage of Americans aged 5+ speaking English at home in each Microdata Area (PUMA) of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, according to the 2016–2021 five-year American Community Survey\nAs of 2016[update], 400 million people spoke English as their first language, and 1.1 billion spoke it as a secondary language.[67] English is the largest language by number of speakers. English is spoken by communities on every continent and on islands in all the major oceans.[68]\n\n\nThe countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country. The \"inner circle\"[69] countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.\n\n\n\n### Three circles of English-speaking countries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of London residents for whom English was their primary language as of 2021\n![Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English](image)Braj Kachru's *Three Circles of English*\nThe Indian linguist Braj Kachru distinguished countries where English is spoken with a three circles model.[69] In his model,\n\n\n\n* the \"inner circle\" countries have large communities of native speakers of English,\n* \"outer circle\" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and\n* \"expanding circle\" countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language.\n\n\nKachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.[70]\n\n\nCountries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231 million),[71] the United Kingdom (60 million),[72][73][74] Canada (19 million),[75] Australia (at least 17 million),[76] South Africa (4.8 million),[77] Ireland (4.2 million), and New Zealand (3.7 million).[78] In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.[79] The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.[70]\n\n\nEstimates of the numbers of second language and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1 billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.[9] Linguist David Crystal estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.[80] In Kachru's three-circles model, the \"outer circle\" countries are countries such as the Philippines,[81] Jamaica,[82] India, Pakistan, Singapore,[83] Malaysia and Nigeria[84][85] with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.[86]\n\n\nThose countries have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.[79] Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,[79] and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.[79]\n\n\nIn the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the \"expanding circle\".[87] The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.[86] For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,[88] and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the \"outer circle\" and \"expanding circle\". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.[89]\n\n\nMany users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use the language.[90] Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.[91] Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries. This is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences.[92]\n\n\n\n### Pluricentric English[edit]\n\n\nPie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in \"inner circle\" English-speaking countries. Native speakers are now substantially outnumbered worldwide by second-language speakers of English (not counted in this chart).\n\n\n\nUS (64.3%)\nUK (16.7%)\nCanada (5.3%)\nAustralia (4.7%)\nSouth Africa (1.3%)\nIreland (1.1%)\nNew Zealand (1%)\nOther (5.6%)\n\nEnglish is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.[93][94][95][96] Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents,[97] but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.[98]\n\n\nAmerican listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.[99] Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.[100]\n\n\nThe settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koineised forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.[101] The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,[71][102] and English has been given official or co-official status by 30 of the 50 state governments, as well as all five territorial governments of the US, though there has never been an official language at the federal level.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### English as a global language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English as a lingua franca\n\nSee also: Foreign-language influences in English and Study of global communication\n\n![](image)Countries in which English language is a mandatory or an optional subject[105]English is a mandatory subject\nEnglish is an optional subject\nNo data\n\nEnglish has ceased to be an \"English language\" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically English.[106][107] Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.[108] Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an \"Afro-Saxon\" language community that unites Africans from different countries.[109]\n\n\nAs decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.[56][57][110] For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.[111] English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.[112] However, English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.[113][114] David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,[115] but the number of English speakers in India is uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.[116]\n\n\nModern English, sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,[59][117] is also regarded as the first world language.[118][119] English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.[119] English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required controlled natural languages[120] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[121] and aviation.[122] English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.[123] It achieved parity with French as a language of diplomacy at the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.[124] By the time of the foundation of the United Nations at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent[125] and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.[126] It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[127] Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.\n\n\nMany regional international organisations such as the European Free Trade Association, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),[60] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.[128]\n\n\nAlthough in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a foreign language.[59][60] In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.[129]\n\n\nA working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine[130] and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by *Chemical Abstracts* in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.[131]\n\n\nInternational communities such as international business people may use English as an auxiliary language, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.[132] Other examples include Simple English.\n\n\nThe increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about language death,[133] and to claims of linguistic imperialism,[134] and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.[135]\n\n\nAlthough some scholars[*who?*] mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.[136] English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.[137] Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.[138][139]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English phonology\n\nThe phonetics and phonology of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.[140] This overview mainly describes the standard pronunciations of the United Kingdom and the United States: Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA). (See § Dialects, accents and varieties, below.)\n\n\nThe phonetic symbols used below are from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Consonants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English phonology § Consonants\n\nMost English dialects share the same 24 consonant phonemes. The consonant inventory shown below is valid for California English,[144] and for RP.[145]\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonant phonemes\n|  | Labial | Dental | Alveolar | Post-alveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasal |  | m |  |  | n |  |  |  | ŋ |  |\n| Plosive | p | b |  | t | d |  |  |  | k | ɡ |  |\n| Affricate |  |  |  |  |  | tʃ | dʒ |  |  |  |  |\n| Fricative | f | v | θ | ð | s | z | ʃ | ʒ |  |  | h |  |\n| Approximant |  |  |  |  |  | ɹ\\*\n |  | j |  | w |  |\n| Lateral approx. |  |  | l |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n\\* Conventionally transcribed /r/\n\n\nIn the table, when obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as /p b/, /tʃ dʒ/, and /s z/, the first is fortis (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p tʃ s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as /b dʒ z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [pʰ] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p̚] or pre-glottalised [ʔp] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus *nip* has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than *nib* [nɪˑb̥] (see below).[146]\n\n\n\n* lenis stops: *bin* [b̥ɪˑn], *about* [əˈbaʊt], *nib* [nɪˑb̥]\n* fortis stops: *pin* [pʰɪn]; *spin* [spɪn]; *happy* [ˈhæpi]; *nip* [nɪp̚] or [nɪʔp]\n\n\nIn RP, the lateral approximant /l/, has two main allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in *light*, and the dark or velarised [ɫ], as in *full*.[147] GA has dark *l* in most cases.[148]\n\n\n\n* clear *l*: RP *light* [laɪt]\n* dark *l*: RP and GA *full* [fʊɫ], GA *light* [ɫaɪt]\n\n\nAll sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, ŋ/) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.[149]\n\n\n\n* voiceless sonorants: *clay* [kl̥eɪ̯]; *snow* RP [sn̥əʊ̯], GA [sn̥oʊ̯]\n* syllabic sonorants: *paddle* [ˈpad.l̩], *button* [ˈbʌt.n̩]\n\n\n### Vowels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English phonology § Vowels\n\nThe pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel phonemes in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from lexical sets compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.[150]\n\n\n\n\n\nMonophthongs\n| RP | GA | Word\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| iː | i | n**ee**d\n |\n| ɪ | b**i**d\n |\n| e | ɛ | b**e**d\n |\n| æ | b**a**ck\n |\n| ɑː | ɑ | br**a** |\n| ɒ | b**o**x\n |\n| ɔ, ɑ | cl**o**th\n |\n| ɔː | p**aw** |\n| uː | u | f**oo**d\n |\n| ʊ | g**oo**d\n |\n| ʌ | b**u**t\n |\n| ɜː | ɜɹ | b**ir**d\n |\n| ə | comm**a** |\n\n\nClosing diphthongs\n| RP | GA | Word\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| eɪ | b**ay** |\n| əʊ | oʊ | r**oa**d\n |\n| aɪ | cr**y** |\n| aʊ | c**ow** |\n| ɔɪ | b**oy** |\n\n\n\n\nCentring diphthongs\n| RP | GA | Word\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ɪə | ɪɹ | p**eer** |\n| eə | ɛɹ | p**air** |\n| ʊə | ʊɹ | p**oor** |\n\n\nIn RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon ⟨ː⟩ in the table above, such as the vowel of *need* [niːd] as opposed to *bid* [bɪd]. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.\n\n\nIn both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t tʃ f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d dʒ v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of *rich* [rɪtʃ], *neat* [nit], and *safe* [seɪ̯f] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of *ridge* [rɪˑdʒ], *need* [niˑd], and *save* [seˑɪ̯v], and the vowel of *light* [laɪ̯t] is shorter than that of *lie* [laˑɪ̯]. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.[151]\n\n\nThe vowel /ə/ only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.[152][153] Some dialects do not contrast /ɪ/ and /ə/ in unstressed positions, so that *rabbit* and *abbot* rhyme and *Lenin* and *Lennon* are homophonous, a dialect feature called weak vowel merger.[154] GA /ɜr/ and /ər/ are realised as an *r*-coloured vowel [ɚ], as in *further* [ˈfɚðɚ] (phonemically /ˈfɜrðər/), which in RP is realised as [ˈfəːðə] (phonemically /ˈfɜːðə/).[155]\n\n\n\n### Phonotactics[edit]\n\n\nAn English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in *sprint* /sprɪnt/, and end with up to five, as in (for some dialects) *angsts* /aŋksts/. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCCC), where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word *strengths* /strɛŋkθs/ is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in *play*; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in *fly* or *sly*; *s* and a voiceless stop, as in *stay*; and *s*, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in *string*.[156] Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable-initial position, and /ŋ/ only in syllable-final position.[157]\n\n\n\n### Stress, rhythm and intonation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stress and vowel reduction in English and Intonation (linguistics) § English\n\nStress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.[158] Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as *can*, have weak and strong forms depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.\n\n\nStress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word *contract* is stressed on the first syllable (/ˈkɒntrækt/ *KON-trakt*) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/kənˈtrækt/ *kən-TRAKT*) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb.[159][160][161] Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /ɒ/, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /ə/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. *a burnout* (/ˈbɜːrnaʊt/) versus *to burn out* (/ˈbɜːrn ˈaʊt/), and *a hotdog* (/ˈhɒtdɒɡ/) versus *a hot dog* (/ˈhɒt ˈdɒɡ/).[162]\n\n\nIn terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.[163] Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.[164]\n\n\n\n### Regional variation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nVarieties of Standard English and their features[165]\n| Phonologicalfeatures | UnitedStates | Canada | Republicof Ireland | NorthernIreland | Scotland | England | Wales | SouthAfrica | Australia | NewZealand |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *father*–*bother* merger | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| /ɒ/ is unrounded | yes | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| /ɜːr/ is pronounced [ɚ] | yes | yes | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *cot*–*caught* merger | possibly | yes | possibly | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |\n| *fool*–*full* merger |  |  |  | yes | yes |  |  |  |  |  |\n| /t, d/ flapping | yes | yes | possibly | often | rarely | rarely | rarely | rarely | yes | often\n |\n| *trap*–*bath* split |  |  | possibly | possibly |  | often | yes | yes | often | yes\n |\n| non-rhotic (/r/-dropping after vowels)\n |  |  |  |  |  | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes\n |\n| close vowels for /æ, ɛ/ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | yes | yes | yes\n |\n| /l/ can always be pronounced [ɫ] | yes | yes |  | yes | yes |  |  |  | yes | yes\n |\n| /ɑːr/ is fronted |  | possibly | possibly |  |  |  |  |  | yes | yes\n |\n\n\n\n\nDialects and low vowels\n| Lexical set | RP | GA | Can | Sound change\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| THOUGHT | /ɔː/ | /ɔ/ or /ɑ/ | /ɑ/ | *cot*–*caught* merger |\n| CLOTH | /ɒ/ | *lot*–*cloth* split |\n| LOT | /ɑ/ | *father*–*bother* merger |\n| PALM | /ɑː/ |\n| BATH | /æ/ | /æ/ | *trap*–*bath* split |\n| TRAP | /æ/ |\n\n\nVarieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table \"Varieties of Standard English and their features\".[165]\n\n\nEnglish has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.[166]\n\n\nSome dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless [ʍ] sound in *whine* that contrasts with the voiced [w] in *wine*, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w], a dialect feature called *wine*–*whine* merger. The unvoiced velar fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes *loch* /lɔx/ from *lock* /lɔk/. Accents like Cockney with \"*h*-dropping\" lack the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with *th*-stopping and *th*-fronting like African-American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives /θ, ð/, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.[167][168] Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as *yod*-dropping, *yod*-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.[169][*page needed*]\n\n\nGeneral American and Received Pronunciation vary in their pronunciation of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.[170]\n\n\nThere is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels /æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three /æ ɑ ɔ/,[171] and in Canadian English, they merge to two /æ ɑ/.[172] In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table \"Dialects and open vowels\" shows this variation with lexical sets in which these sounds occur.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English grammar\n\nAs is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.[173] English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as *have* and *do*, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with *wh*-) and word order inversion with some verbs.[174]\n\n\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs *speak/spoke* and *foot/feet*) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as *love/loved*, *hand/hands*).[175] Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (*he/him, who/whom*) and in the inflection of the copula verb *to be*.[175]\n\n\nThe seven word-classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:[176]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *The* | *chairman* | *of* | *the* | *committee* | *and* | *the* | *loquacious* | *politician* | *clashed* | *violently* | *when* | *the* | *meeting* | *started*.\n |\n| Det. | Noun | Prep. | Det. | Noun | Conj. | Det. | Adj. | Noun | Verb | Advb. | Conj. | Det. | Noun | Verb\n |\n\n\n### Nouns and noun phrases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English nouns\n\nEnglish nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.[177]\n\n\nMost count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -*s*, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. *one loaf of bread*, *two loaves of bread*.[178]\n\n\nRegular plural formation:\n\n\n\n* Singular: *cat, dog*\n* Plural: *cats, dogs*\n\n\nIrregular plural formation:\n\n\n\n* Singular: *man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse*\n* Plural: *men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice*\n\n\nPossession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -*s* (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition *of*. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the *of* possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -*s* also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe. If the noun is plural formed with -s the apostrophe follows the -s.[174]\n\n\nPossessive constructions:\n\n\n\n* With -s: *The woman's husband's child*\n* With of: *The child of the husband of the woman*\n\n\nNouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.[179] Noun phrases can be short, such as *the man*, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. *red*, *tall*, *all*) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. *the*, *that*). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as *and*, or prepositions such as *with*, e.g. *the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles* (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.[174] For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in *The President of India's wife*, where the enclitic follows *India* and not *President*.\n\n\nThe class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where *the* marks a definite noun and *a* or *an* an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include *one*, *many*, *some* and *all*, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. *one man* (sg.) but *all men* (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.[180]\n\n\n\n#### Adjectives[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English adjectives\n\nEnglish adjectives are words such as *good*, *big*, *interesting,* and *Canadian* that most typically modify nouns, denoting characteristics of their referents (e.g., *a red car*). As modifiers, they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.[181] English adjectives also function as predicative complements (e.g., *the child is happy*).\n\n\nIn Modern English, adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases *the slender boy*, and *many slender girls*, the adjective *slender* does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.\n\n\nSome adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix *-er* marking the comparative, and *-est* marking the superlative: *a small boy*, *the boy is smaller than the girl*, *that boy is the smallest*. Some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms, such as *good*, *better*, and *best*. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb *more* marking the comparative, and *most* marking the superlative: *happier* or *more happy*, *the happiest* or *most happy*.[182] There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.[183]\n\n\n\n#### Determiners[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English determiners\n\nEnglish determiners are words such as *the*, *each*, *many*, *some*, and *which*, occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite.[184] They often agree with the noun in number. They do not typically inflect for degree of comparison.\n\n\n\n#### Pronouns, case, and person[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English pronouns\n\nEnglish pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (*I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them*) as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing *it* from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns) and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular (distinguishing between *she/her* [feminine], *they/them* [epicene], and *he/him* [masculine]).[185][186] The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case (for a patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and of the Old English dative case (for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb).[187][188] The subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, otherwise the objective is used.[189] While grammarians such as Henry Sweet[190] and Otto Jespersen[191] noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin-based system, some contemporary grammars, for example Huddleston & Pullum (2002), retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.\n\n\nPossessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in *my chair*), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. *the chair is mine*).[192] The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old second person singular familiar pronoun *thou* acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned).\n\n\nBoth the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular:\n\n\n\n* Plural and singular are always identical (*you*, *your*, *yours*) in the second person (except in the reflexive form: *yourself/yourselves*) in most dialects. Some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns, such as *y'all* (found in Southern American English and African-American (Vernacular) English), *youse* (found in Australian English), or *ye* (in Hiberno-English).\n* In the third person, the *they/them* series of pronouns (*they*, *them*, *their*, *theirs*, *themselves*) are used in both plural and singular, and are the only pronouns available for the plural. In the singular, the *they/them* series (sometimes with the addition of the singular-specific reflexive form *themself*) serve as a gender-neutral set of pronouns. These pronouns are becoming more accepted as part of the LGBT culture.[185][193][194]\n\n\n\n\nEnglish personal pronouns\n| Person | Subjective case | Objective case | Dependent possessive | Independent possessive | Reflexive\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st, singular\n | *I* | *me* | *my* | *mine* | *myself* |\n| 2nd, singular\n | *you* | *you* | *your* | *yours* | *yourself* |\n| 3rd, singular\n | *he/she/it/they* | *him/her/it/them* | *his/her/its/their* | *his/hers/its/theirs* | *himself/herself/itself/themself/themselves* |\n| 1st, plural\n | *we* | *us* | *our* | *ours* | *ourselves* |\n| 2nd, plural\n | *you* | *you* | *your* | *yours* | *yourselves* |\n| 3rd, plural\n | *they* | *them* | *their* | *theirs* | *themselves* |\n\n\nPronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun *I* identifies the speaker, and the pronoun *you*, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as *that* refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence *I already told you that*. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. \"he sent it to himself\" or \"she braced herself for impact\").[195]\n\n\n\n#### Prepositions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. *with the dog*, *for my friend*, *to school*, *in England*.[196] Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.[196] For example, in the phrase *I gave it to him*, the preposition *to* marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb *to give*. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\". But some contemporary grammars such as that of Huddleston & Pullum (2002:598–600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Verbs and verb phrases[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English verbs\n\nEnglish verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb *to be* is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.[182] Auxiliary verbs such as *have* and *be* are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.[197][198]\n\n\nMost verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.[199] The copula verb *to be* is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is *am*, the third person singular form is *is*, and the form *are* is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is *been* and its gerund-participle is *being*.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish inflectional forms\n| Inflection | Strong | Regular\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Plain present\n | *take* | *love* |\n| 3rd person sg.present\n | *takes* | *loves* |\n| Preterite\n | *took* | *loved* |\n| Plain (infinitive)\n | *take* | *love* |\n| Gerund–participle\n | *taking* | *loving* |\n| Past participle\n | *taken* | *loved* |\n\n\n#### Tense, aspect and mood[edit]\n\n\nEnglish has two primary tenses, past (preterite) and non-past. The preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix *-ed*, and for the strong verbs either the suffix *-t* or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix *-s*.[197]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Present | Preterite\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| First person\n | *I run* | *I ran* |\n| Second person\n | *You run* | *You ran* |\n| Third person\n | *John runs* | *John ran* |\n\n\nEnglish does not have future verb forms.[200] The future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs *will* or *shall*.[201] Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb *be going to* (\"going-to future\").[202]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Future\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| First person\n | *I will run* |\n| Second person\n | *You will run* |\n| Third person\n | *John will run* |\n\n\nFurther aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs, primarily *have* and *be*, which show the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (*I have run* vs. *I was running*), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (*I had been running*) and present perfect (*I have been running*).[203]\n\n\nFor the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as *can*, *may*, *will*, *shall* and the past tense forms *could*, *might*, *would*, *should*. There are also subjunctive and imperative moods, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular *-s*), for use in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: *It is important that he run every day*; imperative *Run!*).[201]\n\n\nAn infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition *to*, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.[204] For example, *he has to go* where only the auxiliary verb *have* is inflected for time and the main verb *to go* is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as *I saw him leave*, where the main verb is *see*, which is in a preterite form, and *leave* is in the infinitive.\n\n\n\n#### Phrasal verbs[edit]\n\n\nEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are *to get up*, *to ask out*, *to back up*, *to give up*, *to get together*, *to hang out*, *to put up with*, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. *lay off* meaning *terminate someone's employment*).[205] In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston & Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. *he woke up in the morning* and *he ran up in the mountains* are syntactically equivalent.\n\n\n\n#### Adverbs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English adverbs\n\nThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.[174] Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix *-ly*. For example, in the phrase *the woman walked quickly*, the adverb *quickly* is derived in this way from the adjective *quick*. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as *good*, which has the adverbial form *well*.\n\n\n\n### Syntax[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the English sentence *The cat sat on the mat*, the subject is *the cat* (a noun phrase), the verb is \"sat\", and \"on the mat\" is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase \"the mat\", headed by the preposition \"on\".\nModern English syntax language is moderately analytic.[206] It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.\n\n\n\n#### Basic constituent order[edit]\n\n\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject–verb–object (SVO).[207] The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as *he had hoped to try to open it*.\n\n\nIn most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.[208] The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *The dog* | *bites* | *the man* |\n| S | V | O\n |\n| *The man* | *bites* | *the dog* |\n| S | V | O\n |\n\n\nAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.[209] The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *He* | *hit* | *him* |\n| S | V | O\n |\n\n\nIndirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as *I gave Jane the book* or in a prepositional phrase, such as *I gave the book to Jane*.[210]\n\n\n\n#### Clause syntax[edit]\n\n\nMain article: English clause syntax\n\nIn English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase *I think (that) you are lying*, the main clause is headed by the verb *think*, the subject is *I*, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause *(that) you are lying*. The subordinating conjunction *that* shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.[211] Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence *I saw the letter that you received today*, the relative clause *that you received today* specifies the meaning of the word *letter*, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns *who*, *whose*, *whom* and *which* as well as by *that* (which can also be omitted.)[212] In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.[213]\n\n\n\n#### Auxiliary verb constructions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Do-support, English auxiliary verbs, and Subject–auxiliary inversion\n\nEnglish syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence *the dog did not find its bone*, the clause *find its bone* is the complement of the negated verb *did not*. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.\n\n\nThe verb *do* can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I *did* shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb *not* to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *\\*I know not*—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary *do* is used, to produce a form like *I do not (don't) know.* The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *\\*Know you him?*; grammatical rules require *Do you know him?*[214]\n\n\nNegation is done with the adverb *not*, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not *-n't* can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb *to be*. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English *I don't know him* is the correct answer to the question *Do you know him?*, but not *\\*I know him not*, although this construction may be found in older English.[215]\n\n\nPassive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb *to be* or *to get*, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with *get*. For example, putting the sentence *she sees him* into the passive becomes *he is seen (by her)*, or *he gets seen (by her)*.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Questions[edit]\n\n\nBoth yes–no questions and *wh*-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (*Am I going tomorrow?*, *Where can we eat?*), which may require *do*-support (*Do you like her?*, *Where did he go?*). In most cases, interrogative words (*wh*-words; e.g. *what*, *who*, *where*, *when*, *why*, *how*) appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question *What did you see?*, the word *what* appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the *wh*-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: *Who saw the cat?*.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. *To whose house did you go last night?*. The personal interrogative pronoun *who* is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant *whom* serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.[217]\n\n\n\n#### Discourse level syntax[edit]\n\n\nWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, *the girl was stung by the bee*. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as *it* or *there*, e.g. *it was the girl that the bee stung*, *there was a girl who was stung by a bee*.[218] Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., *it is raining*) or in existential clauses (*there are many cars on the street*). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.\n\n\nFocus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, *the girl was stung by a bee* (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or *The girl was stung by a bee* (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).[219] Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, *That girl over there, she was stung by a bee*, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, *she was stung by a bee, that girl over there*, where reference to the girl is established as an \"afterthought\".[220]\n\n\nCohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. *that is exactly what I mean* where *that* refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or *then* used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).[221] Discourse markers such as *oh*, *so* or *well*, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, *no way is that true!* (the idiomatic marker *no way!* expressing disbelief), or *boy! I'm hungry* (the marker *boy* expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.[222]\n\n\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign-language influences in English\n\nIt is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if obsolete words are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the *Oxford English Dictionary* from 1989.[223] Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.[224]\n\n\nDue to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,[225] collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.[224][226]\n\n\n\n### Word formation processes[edit]\n\n\nEnglish forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,[227] using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,[224][226] producing compound words such as *babysitter* or *ice cream* or *homesick*.[227] A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (*-hood*, *-ness*, *-ing*, *-ility*) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of Latin or Greek origin).\n\n\nFormation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example *television* or *optometry*) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, American lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the \"international scientific vocabulary\" (ISV) when compiling *Webster's Third New International Dictionary* (1961). Another active word-formation process in English are acronyms,[228] words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases, e.g. *NATO*, *laser*.\n\n\n\n### Word origins[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign-language influences in English and Lists of English words by country or language of origin\n\nSee also: Linguistic purism in English\n\nSource languages of the English vocabulary[11][229]\n\n\n\nLatin (29%)\n(Old) French, including Anglo-French (29%)\nGermanic languages (Old/Middle English, Old Norse, Dutch) (26%)\nGreek (6%)\nOther languages/unknown (6%)\nDerived from proper names (4%)\n\nEnglish, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This borrowing is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.[230] Nevertheless, most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in English are still West Germanic.[231][232] The English words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly Germanic words from Old English.[224] It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words, but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords.[233]\n\n\nBut one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of \"Latinate\" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.[234] Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers.[235] Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as *egg* and *knife*.[236]\n\n\nEnglish has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.[226][224] Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.[237] English continues to gain new loanwords and calques (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.[238]\n\n\nEnglish has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.[239][240]\n\n\n\n### English loanwords and calques in other languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Englishization\n\nEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.[234][241] The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world *lingua franca*, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.[242] That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.[243] Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.[244] Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.[244]\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\nSee also: English alphabet, English Braille, and English orthography\n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a Latin alphabet (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in Anglo-Saxon runes are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.[37] The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the Latin script: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z (which also have capital forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\n\nThe spelling system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered and complex, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.[245] Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.[50] Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.[246] There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.[247]\n\n\nAlthough letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.[248] Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling — for example, the words *photograph*, *photography*, and *photographic*,[248] or the words *electricity* and *electrical*. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",[245] there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.[249] The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.[250] Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.[251]\n\n\nReaders of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters *b*, *d*, *f*, *h*, *j*, *k*, *l*, *m*, *n*, *p*, *r*, *s*, *t*, *v*, *w*, *y*, *z* represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters *c* and *g* normally represent /k/ and /ɡ/, but there is also a soft *c* pronounced /s/, and a soft *g* pronounced /dʒ/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters *c* and *g* are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include *ch* for /tʃ/, *sh* for /ʃ/, *th* for /θ/ or /ð/, *ng* for /ŋ/, *qu* for /kw/, and *ph* for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter *x* is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin[248] or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.[252]\n\n\nFor the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (*a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*, *w*, *y*). As a result, some \"long vowels\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the *oa* in *boat*, the *ow* in *how*, and the *ay* in *stay*), or the historically based silent *e* (as in *note* and *cake*).[249]\n\n\nThe consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.[253] Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.[248] Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.[254][255] Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.[256]\n\n\nEnglish writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.[257]\n\n\n\n## Dialects, accents and varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of dialects of English, World Englishes, and regional accents of English\n\nDialectologists identify many English dialects, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE).[258] There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.\n\n\n\n### Britain and Ireland[edit]\n\n\nSee also: English language in England, Estuary English, Northern England English, Welsh English, Scottish English, Scots language, Hiberno-English, and Ulster English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a man with a Received Pronunciation accent (Gyles Brandreth).\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.[260]\n\n\nNonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary. In fact, only 3% of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.[261] There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.[262] Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class; some traits, though exceedingly common, are nonetheless considered \"non-standard\" and associated with lower-class speakers and identities. An example of this is *h*-dropping, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England. However, it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.[263]\n\n\nEnglish in England can be divided into four major dialect regions: Southwest English, South East English, Midlands English, and Northern English. Within each of these regions, several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.[264]\n\n\nSince the 15th century, southeastern England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the South East led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.[265][266][267] Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (*drawing* is pronounced *drawring* /ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/), *t*-glottalisation (*Potter* is pronounced with a glottal stop as *Po'er* /ˈpɒʔə/) and the pronunciation of *th-* as /f/ (*thanks* pronounced *fanks*) or /v/ (*bother* pronounced *bover*).[268]\n\n\nScots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English[269] and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. In addition to Scots, Scottish English comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.[270]\n\n\nIn Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken since the Norman invasions of the 11th century. In County Wexford, in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.[18][271]\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American English, General American, Southern American English, African-American Vernacular English, Canadian English, and Atlantic Canadian English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a Midwestern U.S. male with a General American accent (Emery Emery).\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.[278]\n\n\nThe English language is far and away the most widely used language in the United States. Its roots trace back to the British colonial era, which began with the settlement in present-day Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. While German was the predominant language among German immigrants, who arrived primarily in eastern Pennsylvania, English was ultimately widely adopted throughout the Thirteen Colonies that ultimately launched both the American Revolution and American Revolutionary War against the Kingdom of Great Britain, then rules by King George III and establishing the United States as an independent sovereign nation in September 1783.\n\n\nSeparate from the General American English are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems that have developed over time, including Southern American English, English of the coastal Northeastern United States, including Eastern New England English, New York City English, and African-American Vernacular English, all of which are historically non-rhotic. Canadian English varieties, except for those of the Atlantic provinces and perhaps Quebec, are also classified as General American English, although they often show raising of the vowels /aɪ/ and /aʊ/ before voiceless consonants and have distinct written and pronunciation norms as well.[279]\n\n\nIn Southern American English, the most populous American \"accent group\" outside of the General American English,[280] rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige.[281][282][283] Southern accents are colloquially described as a \"drawl\" or \"twang\",[284] being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /aɪ/ vowel (e.g. pronouncing *spy* almost like *spa*), the \"Southern breaking\" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word \"press\" almost like \"pray-us\"),[285] the pin–pen merger, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.[286]\n\n\nSpoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,[287] contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or Creole English to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.[288] AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of \"broken\" or \"uneducated\" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities.[289][290]\n\n\n\n### Australia and New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian English and New Zealand English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a male with a general Australian accent.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.[291] Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely with British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in *the government is* rather than *are*).[292][293] New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.[294][295][296]\n\n\n\n### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Southeast Asian English, Philippine English, Singapore English, Malaysian English, and Brunei English\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: details on Southeast Asian varieties other than Philippine English.

English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946 and remains an official language of the Philippines. Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, being found on street signs and marquees, in government documents and forms, in courtrooms, in the media and entertainment industries, in the business sector, and in various other aspects of daily life.[297] One particularly prominent form of English usage in the country is found in everyday speech: most Filipinos from Manila use or, at the very least, have been exposed to Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English.[298] A similar code-switching method is used by urban native speakers of Bisayan languages under the name of Bislish.\n\n\n\n### Africa, the Caribbean, and South Asia[edit]\n\n\nSee also: South African English, Nigerian English, Caribbean English, Indian English, Pakistani English, and Bangladeshi English\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\nSpeech example\n\n\nAn example of a male with a South African accent.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?

In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about 9 percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.[299] Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.[300] Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. *pin* pronounced [pɪn] rather than as [pʰɪn] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [ɾ] instead of as the more common fricative.[301]\n\n\nNigerian English is a dialect of English spoken in Nigeria.[302] It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. *senior wife*). Over 150 million Nigerians speak English.[303]\n\n\nSeveral varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, the Leeward and Windward Islands and Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English-based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.[304] Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and code-switching between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as \"basilect\" and the more RP-like forms serving as the \"acrolect\", the most formal register.[305]\n\n\nMost Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [eː] and [oː] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. *bay* and *boat* pronounced [bʲeː] and [bʷoːt]). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced [t͡ʃail] and \"wind\" [win].[306][307][308]\n\n\nAs a historical legacy, Indian English tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [ʈ] and [ɖ]) and the replacement of /θ/ and /ð/ with dentals [t̪] and [d̪]. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling-based pronunciations where the silent ⟨h⟩ found in words such as *ghost* is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [ɡʱ].[309]\n\n\n\n### Non-native varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Non-native pronunciations of English\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

With approximately 234 million native speakers and another 39 million as second language speakers as of 2017,[9] Bengali is the sixth most spoken native language and the seventh most spoken language by the total number of speakers in the world.[10][11] Bengali is the fifth most spoken Indo-European language.\n\n\nBengali is the fourth fastest growing language in India, following Hindi in the first place, Kashmiri in the second place, and Meitei (Manipuri), along with Gujarati, in the third place, according to the 2011 census of India.[12]\n\n\nBengali is the official, national, and most widely spoken language of Bangladesh,[13][14][15] with 98% of Bangladeshis using Bengali as their first language.[16][17] It is the second-most widely spoken of the 22 scheduled languages of India, and is the official language of the states of West Bengal and Tripura and the Barak Valley region of the state of Assam. It is also the second official language of the Indian state of Jharkhand since September 2011.[6] It is the most widely spoken language in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal,[18] and is spoken by significant populations in other states including Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha and Uttarakhand.[19] Bengali is also spoken by the Bengali diasporas (Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian Bengalis) in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and other countries.[20]\n\n\nBengali has developed over more than 1,300 years. Bengali literature, with its millennium-old literary history, was extensively developed during the Bengali Renaissance and is one of the most prolific and diverse literary traditions in Asia. The Bengali language movement from 1948 to 1956 demanding that Bengali be an official language of Pakistan fostered Bengali nationalism in East Bengal leading to the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1999, UNESCO recognised 21 February as International Mother Language Day in recognition of the language movement.[21][22]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Present-day distribution of Indo-European languages in Eurasia. Bengali is one of the easternmost languages\n![](image)Indo- Iranian languages, Bengali marked yellow\n![](image)The descent of proto-Gauda, the ancestor of the modern Bengali language, from the proto-Gauda-Kamarupa line of the proto-Magadhan (Magadhi Prakrit).[23]\n### Ancient[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Sanskrit has been spoken by Hindu Brahmins in Bengal since the 3rd century BC,[24] the local Buddhist population spoke varieties of the Prakrit.[25] These varieties are generally referred to as \"eastern Magadhi Prakrit\", as coined by linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji,[26] as the Middle Indo-Aryan dialects were influential in the first millennium when Bengal was a part of the Greater Magadhan realm.\n\n\nThe local varieties had no official status during the Gupta Empire, and with Bengal increasingly becoming a hub of Sanskrit literature for Hindu priests, the vernacular of Bengal gained a lot of influence from Sanskrit.[27] Magadhi Prakrit was also spoken in modern-day Bihar and Assam, and this vernacular eventually evolved into Ardha Magadhi.[28][29] Ardha Magadhi began to give way to what is known as Apabhraṃśa, by the end of the first millennium. The Bengali language evolved as a distinct language over the course of time.[30]\n\n\n\n### Early[edit]\n\n\nThough some archaeologists claim that some 10th-century texts were in Bengali, it is not certain whether they represent a differentiated language or whether they represent a stage when Eastern Indo-Aryan languages were differentiating.[31] The local Apabhraṃśa of the eastern subcontinent, Purbi Apabhraṃśa or Abahatta (lit. 'meaningless sounds'), eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups, the Bengali–Assamese languages, the Bihari languages, and the Odia language. The language was not static: different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects in this period. For example, Ardhamagadhi is believed to have evolved into Abahatta around the 6th century, which competed with the ancestor of Bengali for some time.[32][*better source needed*] The ancestor of Bengali was the language of the Pala Empire and the Sena dynasty.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Medieval[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Persian language in the Indian subcontinent\n![](image)Silver coin of Maharaj Gaudeshwar Danujmardandev of Deva dynasty, c. 1417\n![](image)Silver coin with proto-Bengali script, Harikela Kingdom, c. 9th–13th century\nDuring the medieval period, Middle Bengali was characterised by the elision of the word-final *অ ô* and the spread of compound verbs, which originated from the Sanskrit Schwa. Slowly, the word-final *ô* disappeared from many words influenced by the Arabic, Persian, and Turkic languages. The arrival of merchants and traders from the Middle East and Turkestan into the Buddhist-ruling Pala Empire, from as early as the 7th century, gave birth to Islamic influence in the region.[*citation needed*] In the 13th century, the subsequent Muslim expeditions to Bengal greatly encouraged the migratory movements of Arab Muslims and Turco-Persians, who heavily influenced the local vernacular by settling among the native population.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBengali acquired prominence, over Persian, in the court of the Sultans of Bengal with the ascent of Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah.[35] Subsequent Muslim rulers actively promoted the literary development of Bengali,[36] allowing it to become the most spoken vernacular language in the Sultanate.[37] Bengali adopted many words from Arabic and Persian, which was a manifestation of Islamic culture on the language. Major texts of Middle Bengali (1400–1800) include Yusuf-Zulekha by Shah Muhammad Sagir and Srikrishna Kirtana by the Chandidas poets. Court support for Bengali culture and language waned when the Mughal Empire conquered Bengal in the late 16th and early 17th century.[38]\n\n\n\n### Modern[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bengali language movement\n\nThe modern literary form of Bengali was developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries based on the west-central dialect spoken in the Nadia region. Bengali shows a high degree of diglossia, with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language.[39] Modern Bengali vocabulary is based on words inherited from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, along with tatsamas and reborrowings from Sanskrit and borrowings from Persian, Arabic, Austroasiatic languages and other languages with which it has historically been in contact.\n\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, there were two main forms of written Bengali:\n\n\n\n* চলিতভাষা *Chôlitôbhasha*, a colloquial form of Bengali using simplified inflections.\n* সাধুভাষা *Sadhubhasha*, a Sanskritised form of Bengali.[40]\n\n\nIn 1948, the Government of Pakistan tried to impose Urdu as the sole state language in Pakistan, giving rise to the Bengali language movement.[41] This was a popular ethnolinguistic movement in the former East Bengal (today Bangladesh), which arose as a result of the strong linguistic consciousness of the Bengalis and their desire to promote and protect spoken and written Bengali's recognition as a state language of the then Dominion of Pakistan. On 21 February 1952, five students and political activists were killed during protests near the campus of the University of Dhaka; they were the first ever martyrs to die for their right to speak their mother tongue. In 1956, Bengali was made a state language of Pakistan.[41] 21 February has since been observed as Language Movement Day in Bangladesh and has also been commemorated as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO every year since 2000.\n\n\nIn 2010, the parliament of Bangladesh and the legislative assembly of West Bengal proposed that Bengali be made an official UN language.[42] As of January 2023, no further action has been yet taken on this matter. However, in 2022, the UN did adopt Bangla as an unofficial language, after a resolution tabled by India.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Central Shaheed Minar in Dhaka, Bangladesh\n![](image)\nLanguage Martyr's Memorial at Silchar Railway Station in Assam, India.\n![](image)\nMother Language Day Monument in Kolkata, West Bengal\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nApproximate distribution of native Bengali speakers (assuming a rounded total of 261 million) worldwide.\n\n\n\nBangladesh (61.3%)\nIndia (37.2%)\nOther (1.5%)\n\nThe Bengali language is native to the region of Bengal, which comprises the present-day nation of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\n\nBesides the native region it is also spoken by the Bengalis living in Tripura, southern Assam and the Bengali population in the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bengali is also spoken in the neighbouring states of Odisha, Bihar, and Jharkhand, and sizeable minorities of Bengali speakers reside in Indian cities outside Bengal, including Delhi, Mumbai, Thane, Varanasi, and Vrindavan. There are also significant Bengali-speaking communities in the Middle East,[44][45][46] the United States,[47] Singapore,[48] Malaysia, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Italy.\n\n\n\n### Official status[edit]\n\n\nSee also: States of India by Bengali speakers\n\nThe 3rd article of the Constitution of Bangladesh states Bengali to be the sole official language of Bangladesh.[15] The Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987, made it mandatory to use Bengali in all records and correspondences, laws, proceedings of court and other legal actions in all courts, government or semi-government offices, and autonomous institutions in Bangladesh.[13] It is also the *de facto* national language of the country.\n\n\nIn India, Bengali is one of the 23 official languages.[49] It is the official language of the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and in Barak Valley of Assam.[50][51] Bengali has been a second official language of the Indian state of Jharkhand since September 2011.\n\n\nIn Pakistan, Bengali is a recognised secondary language in the city of Karachi.[52][53][54] The Department of Bengali in the University of Karachi also offers regular programs of studies at the Bachelors and at the Masters levels for Bengali Literature.[55]\n\n\nThe national anthems of both Bangladesh (*Amar Sonar Bangla*) and India (*Jana Gana Mana*) were written in Bengali by the Bengali Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.[56] Additionally, the first two verses of *Vande Mataram*, a patriotic song written in Bengali by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, was adopted as the \"national song\" of India in both the colonial period and later in 1950 in independent India. Furthermore, it is believed by many that the national anthem of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka Matha) was inspired by a Bengali poem written by Rabindranath Tagore,[57][58][59][60] while some even believe the anthem was originally written in Bengali and then translated into Sinhala.[61][62][63][64]\n\n\nAfter the contribution made by the Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force in the Sierra Leone Civil War under the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, the government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah declared Bengali as an honorary official language in December 2002.[65][66][67][68]\n\n\nIn 2009, elected representatives in both Bangladesh and West Bengal called for Bengali to be made an official language of the United Nations.[69]\n\n\n\n## Dialects[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali dialects\n\n![](image)A map of Bengal (and some districts of Assam and Jharkhand) which shows the dialects of the Bengali language. Bangali (Vanga) dialect\n Manbhumi dialect\n Varendri dialect\n Rarhi dialect\n Sundarbani dialect\n Rajbanshi dialect/language\\*\n Chittagonian dialect/language\\*\n Sylheti dialect/language\\*\n (*those marked with an asterisk \\* are sometimes considered dialects or sometimes as separate languages*)\nRegional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a dialect continuum. Linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji grouped the dialects of Bengali language into four large clusters- Rarhi, Vangiya, Kamrupi and Varendri;[70][71] but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed.[72] The south-western dialects (Rarhi or Nadia dialect) form the basis of modern standard colloquial Bengali. In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka and Sylhet Divisions of Bangladesh), many of the stops and affricates heard in West Bengal and western Bangladesh are pronounced as fricatives. Western alveolo-palatal affricates চ [tɕɔ], ছ [tɕʰɔ], জ [dʑɔ] correspond to eastern চ [tsɔ], ছ [tsʰɔ~sɔ], জ [dzɔ~zɔ]. The influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalised vowels and an alveolar articulation of what are categorised as the \"cerebral\" consonants (as opposed to the postalveolar articulation of West Bengal). Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Hajong is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.[73]\n\n\nDuring the standardisation of Bengali in the 19th century and early 20th century, the cultural centre of Bengal was in Kolkata, a city founded by the British. What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect of Nadia and Kushtia District.[74] There are cases where speakers of Standard Bengali in West Bengal will use a different word from a speaker of Standard Bengali in Bangladesh, even though both words are of native Bengali descent. For example, the word salt is লবণ *lôbôṇ* in the east which corresponds to নুন *nun* in the west.[75]\n\n\nBengali exhibits diglossia, though some scholars have proposed triglossia or even n-glossia or heteroglossia between the written and spoken forms of the language.[39] Two styles of writing have emerged, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax:[74][76]\n\n\n\n1. *Shadhu-bhasha* (সাধু ভাষা \"upright language\") was the written language, with longer verb inflections and more of a Pali and Sanskrit-derived *Tatsama* vocabulary. Songs such as India's national anthem *Jana Gana Mana* (by Rabindranath Tagore) were composed in this style. Its use in modern writing however is uncommon, restricted to some official signs and documents in Bangladesh as well as for achieving particular literary effects.\n2. *Cholito-bhasha* (চলিত ভাষা \"running language\"), known by linguists as Standard Colloquial Bengali, is a written Bengali style exhibiting a preponderance of colloquial idiom and shortened verb forms and is the standard for written Bengali now. This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, promoted by the writings of Peary Chand Mitra (*Alaler Gharer Dulal*, 1857),[77] Pramatha Chaudhuri (*Sabujpatra*, 1914) and in the later writings of Rabindranath Tagore. It is modelled on the dialect spoken in the Shantipur and Shilaidaha region in Nadia and Kushtia Districts. This form of Bengali is often referred to as the \"Kushtia standard\"(Bangladesh), \"Nadia dialect\" (West Bengal), \"Southwestern/West-Central dialect\" \"Shantipuri Bangla\" or \"Shilaidahi Bangla\".[72]\n\n\nLinguist Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar categorises the language as:\n\n\n\n* Madhya Rarhi dialect\n* Kanthi (Contai) dialect\n* Kolkata dialect\n* Shantipuriya (Nadia) dialect\n* Shershahabadia (Maldahiya/ Jangipuri) dialect\n* Barendri dialect\n* Rangapuriya dialect\n* Sylheti dialect\n* Dhakiya (Bikrampuri) dialect\n* Jashore/Jessoriya dialect\n* Barisal (Chandradwip) dialect\n* Chattal (Chittagong) dialect\n\n\nWhile most writing is in Standard Colloquial Bengali (SCB), spoken dialects exhibit a greater variety. People in southeastern West Bengal, including Kolkata, speak in SCB. Other dialects, with minor variations from Standard Colloquial, are used in other parts of West Bengal and western Bangladesh, such as the Midnapore dialect, characterised by some unique words and constructions. However, a majority in Bangladesh speaks dialects notably different from SCB. Some dialects, particularly those of the Chittagong region, bear only a superficial resemblance to SCB.[78] The dialect in the Chittagong region is least widely understood by the general body of Bengalis.[78] The majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one variety – often, speakers are fluent in *Cholitobhasha* (SCB) and one or more regional dialects.[40]\n\n\nEven in SCB, the vocabulary may differ according to the speaker's religion: Muslims are more likely to use words of Persian and Arabic origin, along with more words naturally derived from Sanskrit (tadbhava), whereas Hindus are more likely to use tatsama (words directly borrowed from Sanskrit).[79] For example:[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Predominantly Hindu usage | Origin | Predominantly Muslim usage | Origin | Translation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| নমস্কার *nômôskār* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *namaskāra* | আসসালামু আলাইকুম *āssālāmu ālāikum* | Directly from Arabic *as-salāmu ʿalaykum* | hello\n |\n| নিমন্ত্রণ *nimôntrôṇ* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *nimantraṇa* as opposed to the native Bengali *nemôntônnô* | দাওয়াত *dāoyāt* | Borrowed from Arabic *da`wah* via Persian | invitation\n |\n| জল *jôl* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *jala* | পানি *pāni* | Native, compare with Sanskrit *pānīya* | water\n |\n| স্নান *snān* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *snāna* | গোসল *gosôl* | Borrowed from Arabic *ghusl* via Persian | bath\n |\n| দিদি *didi* | Native, from Sanskrit *devī* | আপা *āpā* | From Turkic languages | sister / elder sister\n |\n| দাদা *dādā* | Native, from Sanskrit *dāyāda* | ভাইয়া *bhāiyā* | Native, from Sanskrit *bhrātā* | brother / elder brother[80] |\n| মাসী *māsī* | Native, from Sanskrit *mātṛṣvasā* | খালা *khālā* | Directly borrowed from Arabic *khālah* | maternal aunt\n |\n| পিসী *pisī* | Native, from Sanskrit *pitṛṣvasā* | ফুফু *phuphu* | Native, from Prakrit *phupphī* | paternal aunt\n |\n| কাকা *kākā* | From Persian or Dravidian *kākā* | চাচা *cācā* | From Prakrit *cācca* | paternal uncle\n |\n| প্রার্থনা *prārthonā* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *prārthanā* | দোয়া *doyā* | Borrowed from Arabic *du`āʾ* | prayer\n |\n| প্রদীপ *prôdīp* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *pradīp* | বাতি *bāti* | Native, compare with Prakrit *batti* and Sanskrit *barti* | lamp\n |\n| লঙ্কা *lônkā* | Native, named after Lanka | মরিচ *môric* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *marica* | chilli\n |\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali phonology\n\nThe phonemic inventory of standard Bengali consists of 29 consonants and 7 vowels, as well as 7 nasalised vowels. The inventory is set out below in the International Phonetic Alphabet (upper grapheme in each box) and romanisation (lower grapheme).\n\n\n\n\n\nVowels\n|  | Front | Central | Back |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Close | ই~ঈii |  | উ~ঊuu\n |\n| Close-mid | এee |  | ওoo\n |\n| Open-mid | অ্যাæ æ |  | অɔô\n |\n| Open |  | আaa |  |\n\n\n\n\nNasalized vowels\n|  | Front | Central | Back |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Close | ইঁ~ঈঁĩĩ\n |  | উঁ~ঊঁũũ\n |\n| Close-mid | এঁẽẽ |  | ওঁõõ\n |\n| Open-mid | এ্যাঁ / অ্যাঁæ̃æ̃\n |  | অঁɔ̃ɔ̃\n |\n| Open |  | আঁ ãã\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nConsonants\n|  | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Retroflex | Palato-alveolar | Velar | Glottal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasal | m | n |  |  | ŋ |  |\n| Plosive/Affricate | voiceless | unaspirated | p | t | ʈ | tʃ | k |  |\n| aspirated | pʰ | tʰ | ʈʰ | tʃʰ | kʰ |  |\n| voiced | unaspirated | b | d | ɖ | dʒ | ɡ |  |\n| aspirated | bʱ | dʱ | ɖʱ | dʒʱ | ɡʱ |  |\n| Fricative | voiceless | (ɸ) | s |  | ʃ |  | (h)\n |\n| voiced | (β) | (z) |  |  |  | ɦ |\n| Approximant | (w) | l |  | (j) |  |  |\n| Rhotic | unaspirated |  | r | ɽ |  |  |  |\n| aspirated |  |  | (ɽʱ) |  |  |  |\n\n\nBengali is known for its wide variety of diphthongs, combinations of vowels occurring within the same syllable.[81] Two of these, /oi̯/ and /ou̯/, are the only ones with representation in script, as ঐ and ঔ respectively. /e̯ i̯ o̯ u̯/ may all form the glide part of a diphthong. The total number of diphthongs is not established, with bounds at 17 and 31. An incomplete chart is given by Sarkar (1985) of the following:[82]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | e̯ | i̯ | o̯ | u̯ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| a | ae̯ | ai̯ | ao̯ | au̯ |\n| æ | æe̯ |  | æo̯ |  |\n| e |  | ei̯ |  | eu̯ |\n| i |  | ii̯ |  | iu̯ |\n| o | oe̯ | oi̯ | oo̯ | ou̯ |\n| u |  | ui̯ |  |  |\n\n\n### Stress[edit]\n\n\nIn standard Bengali, stress is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all trochaic; the primary stress falls on the initial syllable of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in সহযোগিতা ***shô**-hô-**jo**-gi-**ta*** \"cooperation\", where the **boldface** represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n\n\n### Consonant clusters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali consonant clusters\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial consonant clusters;[83] the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e., one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as গেরাম *geram* (CV.CVC) for গ্রাম *gram* (CCVC) \"village\" or ইস্কুল *iskul* (VC.CVC) for স্কুল *skul* (CCVC) \"school\".\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bengali-Assamese Script, Bengali alphabet, and Bengali Braille\n\n![](image)An example of handwritten Bengali. Part of a poem written in Bengali (and with its English translation below each Bengali paragraph) by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore in 1926 in Hungary\n![](image)The Library of Whitechapel in East London with the word \"বাংলা\" illuminated in its front.\nBengali-Assamese script is an abugida, a script with letters for consonants, diacritics for vowels, and in which an inherent vowel (অ *ô*) is assumed for consonants if no vowel is marked.[84] The Bengali alphabet is used throughout Bangladesh and eastern India (Assam, West Bengal, Tripura). The Bengali alphabet is believed to have evolved from a modified Brahmic script around 1000 CE (or 10th–11th century).[85] It is a cursive script with eleven graphemes or signs denoting nine vowels and two diphthongs, and thirty-nine graphemes representing consonants and other modifiers.[85] There are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms. The letters run from left to right and spaces are used to separate orthographic words. Bengali script has a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the graphemes that links them together called মাত্রা *matra*.[86]\n\n\nSince the Bengali script is an abugida, its consonant graphemes usually do not represent phonetic segments, but carry an \"inherent\" vowel and thus are syllabic in nature. The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either [ɔ] as in মত [m**ɔ**t] \"opinion\" or [o], as in মন [m**o**n] \"mind\", with variants like the more open [ɒ]. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the *hôsôntô* (্), may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in ম্ [m]). This diacritic, however, is not common and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a *hôsôntô*, may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final ন in মন [m**o**n] or the medial ম in গামলা [ɡamla]).\n\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent [ɔ] is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel allographs above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel typographic ligatures. These allographs, called কার *kar*, are diacritical vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph মি [mi] represents the consonant [m] followed by the vowel [i], where [i] is represented as the diacritical allographি (called ই-কার *i-kar*) and is placed *before* the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs মা [ma], মী [mi], মু [mu], মূ [mu], মৃ [mri], মে [me~mɛ], মৈ [moj], মো [mo] and মৌ [mow] represent the same consonant ম combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel [ɔ] is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign ম [mɔ].\n\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in মই [moj] \"ladder\" and in ইলিশ [iliʃ] \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel ই is used (cf. the dependent formি). A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing *hôsôntô*, three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed *chôndrôbindu* (ঁ), denoting a suprasegmental for nasalisation of vowels (as in চাঁদ [tʃãd] \"moon\"), the postposed *ônusbar* (ং) indicating the velar nasal [ŋ] (as in বাংলা [baŋla] \"Bengali\") and the postposed *bisôrgô* (ঃ) indicating the voiceless glottal fricative [h] (as in উঃ! [uh] \"ouch!\") or the gemination of the following consonant (as in দুঃখ [dukʰːɔ] \"sorrow\").\n\n\nThe Bengali consonant clusters (যুক্তব্যঞ্জন *juktôbênjôn*) are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist a few visual formulas to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke । *daṛi* – the Bengali equivalent of a full stop – have been adopted from Western scripts and their usage is similar.[87]\n\n\nUnlike in Western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called মাত্রা *matra*. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter ত *tô* and the numeral ৩ \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the *matra*, as is the case between the consonant cluster ত্র *trô* and the independent vowel এ *e*, also the letter হ *hô* and Bengali Ôbogroho ঽ *(~ô)* and letter ও *o* and consonant cluster ত্ত *ttô*. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard collating sequence (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n\n\n### Alternative and historic scripts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An 1855 Dobhashi manuscript of *Halat-un-Nabi* written by Sadeq Ali using the Sylheti Nagri script.\nThroughout history, there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in different scripts, though these employments were never popular on a large scale and were communally limited. Owing to Bengal's geographic location, Bengali areas bordering non-Bengali regions have been influenced by each other. Small numbers of people in Midnapore, which borders Odisha, have used the Odia script to write in Bengali. In the border areas between West Bengal and Bihar, some Bengali communities historically wrote Bengali in Devanagari, Kaithi and Tirhuta.[88]\n\n\nIn Sylhet and Bankura, modified versions of the Kaithi script had some historical prominence, mainly among Muslim communities. The variant in Sylhet was identical to the Baitali Kaithi script of Hindustani with the exception of Sylhet Nagri possessing *matra*.[89] Sylhet Nagri was standardised for printing in c. 1869.[14]\n\n\nUp until the 19th century, numerous variations of the Arabic script had been used across Bengal from Chittagong in the east to Meherpur in the west.[90][91][92] The 14th-century court scholar of Bengal, Nur Qutb Alam, composed Bengali poetry using the Persian alphabet.[93][94] After the Partition of India in the 20th century, the Pakistani government attempted to institute the Perso-Arabic script as the standard for Bengali in East Pakistan; this was met with resistance and contributed to the Bengali language movement.[95]\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Portuguese missionaries began a tradition of using the Roman alphabet to transcribe the Bengali language. Though the Portuguese standard did not receive much growth, a few Roman Bengali works relating to Christianity and Bengali grammar were printed as far as Lisbon in 1743. The Portuguese were followed by the English and French respectively, whose works were mostly related to Bengali grammar and transliteration. The first version of the Aesop's Fables in Bengali was printed using Roman letters based on English phonology by the Scottish linguist John Gilchrist. Consecutive attempts to establish a Roman Bengali have continued across every century since these times, and have been supported by the likes of Suniti Kumar Chatterji, Muhammad Qudrat-i-Khuda, and Muhammad Enamul Haq.[96] The Digital Revolution has also played a part in the adoption of the English alphabet to write Bengali,[97] with certain social media influencers publishing entire novels in Roman Bengali.[98]\n\n\nBengali script like others does have Schwa deletion. It does not mark when the inherent vowel is not used (mainly at the end of words)\n\n\n\n### Orthographic depth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,[87] and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters (শ, ষ, and স) for the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ], although the letter স retains the voiceless alveolar sibilant [s] sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in স্খলন [skʰɔlon] \"fall\", স্পন্দন [spɔndon] \"beat\", etc. The letter ষ also, sometimes, retains the voiceless retroflex sibilant [ʂ] sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in কষ্ট [kɔʂʈo] \"suffering\", গোষ্ঠী [ɡoʂʈʰi] \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters (জ and য) for the voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ]. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal ণ [ɳ] is now pronounced as an alveolar [n] when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another retroflex consonant such as ট, ঠ, ড and ঢ), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The near-open front unrounded vowel [æ] is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: এত [æto] \"so much\", এ্যাকাডেমী [ækademi] \"academy\", অ্যামিবা [æmiba] \"amoeba\", দেখা [dækʰa] \"to see\", ব্যস্ত [bæsto] \"busy\", ব্যাকরণ [bækorɔn] \"grammar\".\n\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either [ɔ] or [o] depending on vowel harmony (স্বরসঙ্গতি) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in কম [kɔm] \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants ক্ [k] and ষ [ʂ] is graphically realised as ক্ষ and is pronounced [kkʰo] (as in রুক্ষ [rukkʰo] \"coarse\"), [kʰɔ] (as in ক্ষমতা [kʰɔmota] \"capability\") or even [kʰo] (as in ক্ষতি [kʰoti] \"harm\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n\n\n### Uses[edit]\n\n\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese, and other languages is known as Bengali script. The script is known as the Bengali alphabet for Bengali and its dialects and the Assamese alphabet for Assamese language with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali script like the Meitei language in the Indian state of Manipur, where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali script for centuries, though the Meitei script has been promoted in recent times.\n\n\n\n### Number system[edit]\n\n\nBengali digits are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ০\n | ১\n | ২\n | ৩\n | ৪\n | ৫\n | ৬\n | ৭\n | ৮\n | ৯\n |\n\n\nThere are additional digits for fractions and prices, though they are little used any longer.[*vague*]\n\n\n\n### Romanisation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Romanisation of Bengali\n\nThere are various romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, or IAST system (based on diacritics);[99] \"Indian languages Transliteration\", or ITRANS (uses upper case letters suited for ASCII keyboards);[100] and the National Library at Kolkata romanisation.[101]\n\n\nIn the context of Bengali romanisation, it is important to distinguish transliteration from transcription. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently romanised on Wikipedia using a phonemic transcription, where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, *Abol Tabol*, *Hasi Khusi* and *Sahoj Path*, in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali grammar\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives (inflection). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately declined (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four cases while verbs are heavily conjugated, and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n\n\n### Word order[edit]\n\n\nAs a head-final language, Bengali follows a subject–object–verb word order, although variations on this theme are common.[102] Bengali makes use of postpositions, as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. Determiners follow the noun, while numerals, adjectives, and possessors precede the noun.[103]\n\n\nYes–no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) tone of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional particles (e.g. কি *-ki*, না *-na*, etc.) are often encliticised onto the first or last word of a yes–no question.\n\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to focus position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n\n\n### Nouns[edit]\n\n\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for case, including nominative, objective, genitive (possessive), and locative.[30] The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of animacy. When a definite article such as -টা *-ṭa* (singular) or -গুলো *-gulo* (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for number.\n\n\nIn most of Bengali grammar books, cases are divided into 6 categories and an additional possessive case (the possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in terms of usage, cases are generally grouped into only 4 categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nSingular noun inflection\n|  | Animate\n | Inanimate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nominative\n | ছাত্রটিchatrô-ṭi\nছাত্রটিchatrô-ṭithe student\n | জুতোটিjuto-ṭa\nজুতোটিjuto-ṭathe shoe\n |\n| Objective\n | ছাত্রটি**কে**chatrô-ṭi-**ke**\nছাত্রটি**কে**chatrô-ṭi-**ke**the student\n | জুতোটাjuto-ṭa\nজুতোটাjuto-ṭathe shoe\n |\n| Genitive\n | ছাত্রটি**র**chatrô-ṭi-**r**\nছাত্রটি**র**chatrô-ṭi-**r**the student's\n | জুতোটা**র**juto-ṭa-**r**\nজুতোটা**র**juto-ṭa-**r**the shoe's\n |\n| Locative\n | –\n | জুতোটা**য়**juto-ṭa-**y**\nজুতোটা**য়**juto-ṭa-**y**on/in the shoe\n |\n\n | \n\nPlural noun inflection\n|  | Animate\n | Inanimate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nominative\n | ছাত্র**রা**chatrô-**ra**\n/\nছাত্রগণ\nছাত্র**রা** / ছাত্রগণchatrô-**ra** {} {}the students\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলোjuto-gulo\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলোjuta-gula / juto-gulothe shoes\n |\n| Objective\n | ছাত্র**দের(কে)**chatrô-**der(ke)**\nছাত্র**দের(কে)**chatrô-**der(ke)**the students\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলোjuto-gulo\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলোjuta-gula / juto-gulothe shoes\n |\n| Genitive\n | ছাত্র**দের**chatrô-**der**\nছাত্র**দের**chatrô-**der**the students'\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলো**র**juto-gulo-**r**\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলো**র**juta-gula / juto-gulo-**r**the shoes'\n |\n| Locative\n | –\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলো**তে**juto-gulo-**te**\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলো**তে**juta-gula / juto-gulo-**te**on/in the shoes\n |\n\n |\n\n\nWhen counted, nouns take one of a small set of measure words. Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word (**MW**), a classifier, must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word -টা *-ṭa*, though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. -জন *-jôn* for humans). There is also the classifier *-khana,* and its diminutive form *-khani*, which attaches only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.[104]\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure words\n| Example\n |\n| --- |\n| নয়**টা**Nôy-**ṭa**nine-**MW**\nগরুgorucow\nনয়**টা** গরুNôy-**ṭa** gorunine-**MW** cowNine cows\n |\n| কয়**টা**Kôy-**ṭa**how many-**MW**\nবালিশbalishpillow\nকয়**টা** বালিশKôy-**ṭa** balish{how many}-**MW** pillowHow many pillows\n |\n| অনেক**জন**Ônek-**jôn**many-**MW**\nলোকlokperson\nঅনেক**জন** লোকÔnek-**jôn** lokmany-**MW** personMany people\n |\n| চার-পাঁচ**জন**Ĉar-pãc-**jôn**four-five-**MW**\nশিক্ষকshikkhôkteacher\nচার-পাঁচ**জন** শিক্ষকĈar-pãc-**jôn** shikkhôkfour-five-**MW** teacherFour to five teachers\n |\n\n\nMeasuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. আট বিড়াল *aṭ biṛal* instead of আট**টা** বিড়াল *aṭ-**ṭa** biṛal* \"eight cats\") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. শুধু এক**জন** থাকবে। *Shudhu êk-**jôn** thakbe.* (lit. \"Only one-**MW** will remain.\") would be understood to mean \"Only one **person** will remain.\", given the semantic class implicit in -জন *-jôn*.\n\n\nIn this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to mass nouns.\n\n\n\n### Verbs[edit]\n\n\nThere are two classes of verbs: finite and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for person (first, second, third), tense (present, past, future), aspect (simple, perfect, progressive), and honour (intimate, familiar, and formal), but *not* for number. Conditional, imperative, and other special inflections for mood can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n\nInflectional suffixes in the morphology of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in syntax.\n\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the zero copula, where the copula or connective *be* is often missing in the present tense.[87] Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is সে শিক্ষক *se shikkhôk*, (literally \"he teacher\").[105] In this respect, Bengali is similar to Russian and Hungarian. Romani grammar is also the closest to Bengali grammar.[106]\n\n\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nSources of modern literary Bengali words\n\n\n\nNative (67%)\nSanskrit borrowings (25%)\nIndigenous and foreign loans (8%)\nMain article: Bengali vocabulary\n\nBengali has as many as 100,000 separate words, of which 50,000 are considered Tadbhavas, 21,100 are Tatsamas and the remainder loanwords from Austroasiatic and other foreign languages.\n\n\nHowever, these figures do not take into account the large proportion of archaic or highly technical words that are very rarely used. Furthermore, different dialects use more Persian and Arabic vocabulary, especially in different areas of Bangladesh and Muslim majority areas of West Bengal. Hindus, on the other hand, use more Sanskrit vocabulary than Muslims. Standard Bengali is based on the Nadia dialect spoken in the Hindu-majority states of West Bengal and parts of the Muslim-majority division of Khulna in Bangladesh. About 90% of Bengalis in Bangladesh (ca. 148 million) and 27% of Bengalis in West Bengal and 10% in Assam (ca. 36 million) are Muslim and the Bangladeshi Muslims and some of the Indian Bengali Muslims speak a more \"persio-arabised\" version of Bengali instead of the more Sanskrit influenced Standard Nadia dialect although the majority of the Indian Bengalis of West Bengal speaks in Rarhi dialect irrespective of religion. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of Tadbhavas, while Tatsamas make up only 25% of the total.[107][108] Loanwords from non-Indic languages account for the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.\n\n\nAccording to Suniti Kumar Chatterji, dictionaries from the early 20th century attributed a little more than 50% of the Bengali vocabulary to native words (i.e., naturally modified Sanskrit words, corrupted forms of Sanskrit words, and loanwords non-Indo-European languages). About 45% per cent of Bengali words are unmodified Sanskrit, and the remaining words are from foreign languages.[109] Dominant in the last group was Persian, which was also the source of some grammatical forms. More recent studies suggest that the use of native and foreign words has been increasing, mainly because of the preference of Bengali speakers for the colloquial style.[109] Because of centuries of contact with Europeans, Turkic peoples, and Persians, Bengali has absorbed numerous words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these borrowings into the core vocabulary.\n\n\nThe most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. After close contact with several indigenous Austroasiatic languages,[110][111][112][113] and later the Mughal conquest whose court language was Persian, numerous Chagatai, Arabic, and Persian words were absorbed into the lexicon.[41]\n\n\nLater, East Asian travellers and lately European colonialism brought words from Portuguese, French, Dutch, and most significantly English during the colonial period.\n\n\n\n## Sample text[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a sample text in Bengali of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\n\nসমস্ত\n\nSômôstô\n\nʃɔmosto\n\nAll\nমানুষ\n\nmanush\n\nmanuʃ\n\nhuman\nস্বাধীনভাবে\n\nshadhinbhabe\n\nʃadʱinbʱabe\n\nfree-manner-in\nসমান\n\nsôman\n\nʃoman\n\nequal\nমর্যাদা\n\nmôrjada\n\nmɔɾdʒada\n\ndignity\nএবং\n\nebông\n\neboŋ\n\nand\nঅধিকার\n\nôdhikar\n\nodʱikaɾ\n\nright\nনিয়ে\n\nniye\n\nnie̯e\n\ntaken\nজন্মগ্রহণ\n\njônmôgrôhôn\n\ndʒɔnmoɡrohon\n\nbirth-take\nকরে।\n\nkôre.\n\nkɔɾe\n\ndo.\nতাঁদের\n\nTãder\n\ntãdeɾ\n\nTheir\nবিবেক\n\nbibek\n\nbibek\n\nreason\nএবং\n\nebông\n\neboŋ\n\nand\nবুদ্ধি\n\nbuddhi\n\nbudʱːi\n\nintelligence\nআছে;\n\nachhe;\n\natʃʰe\n\nexist;\nসুতরাং\n\nsutôrang\n\nʃutoraŋ\n\ntherefore\nসকলেরই\n\nsôkôleri\n\nʃɔkoleɾi\n\neveryone-indeed\nএকে\n\nêke\n\nɛke\n\none\nঅপরের\n\nôpôrer\n\nɔporeɾ\n\nanother's\nপ্রতি\n\nprôti\n\nproti\n\ntowards\nভ্রাতৃত্বসুলভ\n\nbhratrittôsulôbh\n\nbʱratritːoʃulɔbʱ\n\nbrotherhood-ly\nমনোভাব\n\nmônobhab\n\nmonobʱab\n\nattitude\nনিয়ে\n\nniye\n\nnie̯e\n\ntaken\nআচরণ\n\nachôrôn\n\natʃorɔn\n\nconduct\nকরা\n\nkôra\n\nkɔra\n\ndo\nউচিত।\n\nuchit.\n\nutʃit\n\nshould.\nসমস্ত মানুষ স্বাধীনভাবে সমান মর্যাদা এবং অধিকার নিয়ে জন্মগ্রহণ করে। তাঁদের বিবেক এবং বুদ্ধি আছে; সুতরাং সকলেরই একে অপরের প্রতি ভ্রাতৃত্বসুলভ মনোভাব নিয়ে আচরণ করা উচিত।\n\nSômôstô manush shadhinbhabe sôman môrjada ebông ôdhikar niye jônmôgrôhôn kôre.

With approximately 234 million native speakers and another 39 million as second language speakers as of 2017,[9] Bengali is the sixth most spoken native language and the seventh most spoken language by the total number of speakers in the world.[10][11] Bengali is the fifth most spoken Indo-European language.\n\n\nBengali is the fourth fastest growing language in India, following Hindi in the first place, Kashmiri in the second place, and Meitei (Manipuri), along with Gujarati, in the third place, according to the 2011 census of India.[12]\n\n\nBengali is the official, national, and most widely spoken language of Bangladesh,[13][14][15] with 98% of Bangladeshis using Bengali as their first language.[16][17] It is the second-most widely spoken of the 22 scheduled languages of India, and is the official language of the states of West Bengal and Tripura and the Barak Valley region of the state of Assam. It is also the second official language of the Indian state of Jharkhand since September 2011.[6] It is the most widely spoken language in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal,[18] and is spoken by significant populations in other states including Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha and Uttarakhand.[19] Bengali is also spoken by the Bengali diasporas (Bangladeshi diaspora and Indian Bengalis) in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and other countries.[20]\n\n\nBengali has developed over more than 1,300 years. Bengali literature, with its millennium-old literary history, was extensively developed during the Bengali Renaissance and is one of the most prolific and diverse literary traditions in Asia. The Bengali language movement from 1948 to 1956 demanding that Bengali be an official language of Pakistan fostered Bengali nationalism in East Bengal leading to the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. In 1999, UNESCO recognised 21 February as International Mother Language Day in recognition of the language movement.[21][22]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Present-day distribution of Indo-European languages in Eurasia. Bengali is one of the easternmost languages\n![](image)Indo- Iranian languages, Bengali marked yellow\n![](image)The descent of proto-Gauda, the ancestor of the modern Bengali language, from the proto-Gauda-Kamarupa line of the proto-Magadhan (Magadhi Prakrit).[23]\n### Ancient[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Sanskrit has been spoken by Hindu Brahmins in Bengal since the 3rd century BC,[24] the local Buddhist population spoke varieties of the Prakrit.[25] These varieties are generally referred to as \"eastern Magadhi Prakrit\", as coined by linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji,[26] as the Middle Indo-Aryan dialects were influential in the first millennium when Bengal was a part of the Greater Magadhan realm.\n\n\nThe local varieties had no official status during the Gupta Empire, and with Bengal increasingly becoming a hub of Sanskrit literature for Hindu priests, the vernacular of Bengal gained a lot of influence from Sanskrit.[27] Magadhi Prakrit was also spoken in modern-day Bihar and Assam, and this vernacular eventually evolved into Ardha Magadhi.[28][29] Ardha Magadhi began to give way to what is known as Apabhraṃśa, by the end of the first millennium. The Bengali language evolved as a distinct language over the course of time.[30]\n\n\n\n### Early[edit]\n\n\nThough some archaeologists claim that some 10th-century texts were in Bengali, it is not certain whether they represent a differentiated language or whether they represent a stage when Eastern Indo-Aryan languages were differentiating.[31] The local Apabhraṃśa of the eastern subcontinent, Purbi Apabhraṃśa or Abahatta (lit. 'meaningless sounds'), eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups, the Bengali–Assamese languages, the Bihari languages, and the Odia language. The language was not static: different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects in this period. For example, Ardhamagadhi is believed to have evolved into Abahatta around the 6th century, which competed with the ancestor of Bengali for some time.[32][*better source needed*] The ancestor of Bengali was the language of the Pala Empire and the Sena dynasty.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Medieval[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Persian language in the Indian subcontinent\n![](image)Silver coin of Maharaj Gaudeshwar Danujmardandev of Deva dynasty, c. 1417\n![](image)Silver coin with proto-Bengali script, Harikela Kingdom, c. 9th–13th century\nDuring the medieval period, Middle Bengali was characterised by the elision of the word-final *অ ô* and the spread of compound verbs, which originated from the Sanskrit Schwa. Slowly, the word-final *ô* disappeared from many words influenced by the Arabic, Persian, and Turkic languages. The arrival of merchants and traders from the Middle East and Turkestan into the Buddhist-ruling Pala Empire, from as early as the 7th century, gave birth to Islamic influence in the region.[*citation needed*] In the 13th century, the subsequent Muslim expeditions to Bengal greatly encouraged the migratory movements of Arab Muslims and Turco-Persians, who heavily influenced the local vernacular by settling among the native population.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBengali acquired prominence, over Persian, in the court of the Sultans of Bengal with the ascent of Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah.[35] Subsequent Muslim rulers actively promoted the literary development of Bengali,[36] allowing it to become the most spoken vernacular language in the Sultanate.[37] Bengali adopted many words from Arabic and Persian, which was a manifestation of Islamic culture on the language. Major texts of Middle Bengali (1400–1800) include Yusuf-Zulekha by Shah Muhammad Sagir and Srikrishna Kirtana by the Chandidas poets. Court support for Bengali culture and language waned when the Mughal Empire conquered Bengal in the late 16th and early 17th century.[38]\n\n\n\n### Modern[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bengali language movement\n\nThe modern literary form of Bengali was developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries based on the west-central dialect spoken in the Nadia region. Bengali shows a high degree of diglossia, with the literary and standard form differing greatly from the colloquial speech of the regions that identify with the language.[39] Modern Bengali vocabulary is based on words inherited from Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, along with tatsamas and reborrowings from Sanskrit and borrowings from Persian, Arabic, Austroasiatic languages and other languages with which it has historically been in contact.\n\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, there were two main forms of written Bengali:\n\n\n\n* চলিতভাষা *Chôlitôbhasha*, a colloquial form of Bengali using simplified inflections.\n* সাধুভাষা *Sadhubhasha*, a Sanskritised form of Bengali.[40]\n\n\nIn 1948, the Government of Pakistan tried to impose Urdu as the sole state language in Pakistan, giving rise to the Bengali language movement.[41] This was a popular ethnolinguistic movement in the former East Bengal (today Bangladesh), which arose as a result of the strong linguistic consciousness of the Bengalis and their desire to promote and protect spoken and written Bengali's recognition as a state language of the then Dominion of Pakistan. On 21 February 1952, five students and political activists were killed during protests near the campus of the University of Dhaka; they were the first ever martyrs to die for their right to speak their mother tongue. In 1956, Bengali was made a state language of Pakistan.[41] 21 February has since been observed as Language Movement Day in Bangladesh and has also been commemorated as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO every year since 2000.\n\n\nIn 2010, the parliament of Bangladesh and the legislative assembly of West Bengal proposed that Bengali be made an official UN language.[42] As of January 2023, no further action has been yet taken on this matter. However, in 2022, the UN did adopt Bangla as an unofficial language, after a resolution tabled by India.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Central Shaheed Minar in Dhaka, Bangladesh\n![](image)\nLanguage Martyr's Memorial at Silchar Railway Station in Assam, India.\n![](image)\nMother Language Day Monument in Kolkata, West Bengal\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nApproximate distribution of native Bengali speakers (assuming a rounded total of 261 million) worldwide.\n\n\n\nBangladesh (61.3%)\nIndia (37.2%)\nOther (1.5%)\n\nThe Bengali language is native to the region of Bengal, which comprises the present-day nation of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal.\n\n\nBesides the native region it is also spoken by the Bengalis living in Tripura, southern Assam and the Bengali population in the Indian union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bengali is also spoken in the neighbouring states of Odisha, Bihar, and Jharkhand, and sizeable minorities of Bengali speakers reside in Indian cities outside Bengal, including Delhi, Mumbai, Thane, Varanasi, and Vrindavan. There are also significant Bengali-speaking communities in the Middle East,[44][45][46] the United States,[47] Singapore,[48] Malaysia, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Italy.\n\n\n\n### Official status[edit]\n\n\nSee also: States of India by Bengali speakers\n\nThe 3rd article of the Constitution of Bangladesh states Bengali to be the sole official language of Bangladesh.[15] The Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987, made it mandatory to use Bengali in all records and correspondences, laws, proceedings of court and other legal actions in all courts, government or semi-government offices, and autonomous institutions in Bangladesh.[13] It is also the *de facto* national language of the country.\n\n\nIn India, Bengali is one of the 23 official languages.[49] It is the official language of the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and in Barak Valley of Assam.[50][51] Bengali has been a second official language of the Indian state of Jharkhand since September 2011.\n\n\nIn Pakistan, Bengali is a recognised secondary language in the city of Karachi.[52][53][54] The Department of Bengali in the University of Karachi also offers regular programs of studies at the Bachelors and at the Masters levels for Bengali Literature.[55]\n\n\nThe national anthems of both Bangladesh (*Amar Sonar Bangla*) and India (*Jana Gana Mana*) were written in Bengali by the Bengali Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.[56] Additionally, the first two verses of *Vande Mataram*, a patriotic song written in Bengali by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, was adopted as the \"national song\" of India in both the colonial period and later in 1950 in independent India. Furthermore, it is believed by many that the national anthem of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka Matha) was inspired by a Bengali poem written by Rabindranath Tagore,[57][58][59][60] while some even believe the anthem was originally written in Bengali and then translated into Sinhala.[61][62][63][64]\n\n\nAfter the contribution made by the Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force in the Sierra Leone Civil War under the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, the government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah declared Bengali as an honorary official language in December 2002.[65][66][67][68]\n\n\nIn 2009, elected representatives in both Bangladesh and West Bengal called for Bengali to be made an official language of the United Nations.[69]\n\n\n\n## Dialects[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali dialects\n\n![](image)A map of Bengal (and some districts of Assam and Jharkhand) which shows the dialects of the Bengali language. Bangali (Vanga) dialect\n Manbhumi dialect\n Varendri dialect\n Rarhi dialect\n Sundarbani dialect\n Rajbanshi dialect/language\\*\n Chittagonian dialect/language\\*\n Sylheti dialect/language\\*\n (*those marked with an asterisk \\* are sometimes considered dialects or sometimes as separate languages*)\nRegional variation in spoken Bengali constitutes a dialect continuum. Linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji grouped the dialects of Bengali language into four large clusters- Rarhi, Vangiya, Kamrupi and Varendri;[70][71] but many alternative grouping schemes have also been proposed.[72] The south-western dialects (Rarhi or Nadia dialect) form the basis of modern standard colloquial Bengali. In the dialects prevalent in much of eastern and south-eastern Bangladesh (Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka and Sylhet Divisions of Bangladesh), many of the stops and affricates heard in West Bengal and western Bangladesh are pronounced as fricatives. Western alveolo-palatal affricates চ [tɕɔ], ছ [tɕʰɔ], জ [dʑɔ] correspond to eastern চ [tsɔ], ছ [tsʰɔ~sɔ], জ [dzɔ~zɔ]. The influence of Tibeto-Burman languages on the phonology of Eastern Bengali is seen through the lack of nasalised vowels and an alveolar articulation of what are categorised as the \"cerebral\" consonants (as opposed to the postalveolar articulation of West Bengal). Some variants of Bengali, particularly Chittagonian and Chakma, have contrastive tone; differences in the pitch of the speaker's voice can distinguish words. Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Hajong is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.[73]\n\n\nDuring the standardisation of Bengali in the 19th century and early 20th century, the cultural centre of Bengal was in Kolkata, a city founded by the British. What is accepted as the standard form today in both West Bengal and Bangladesh is based on the West-Central dialect of Nadia and Kushtia District.[74] There are cases where speakers of Standard Bengali in West Bengal will use a different word from a speaker of Standard Bengali in Bangladesh, even though both words are of native Bengali descent. For example, the word salt is লবণ *lôbôṇ* in the east which corresponds to নুন *nun* in the west.[75]\n\n\nBengali exhibits diglossia, though some scholars have proposed triglossia or even n-glossia or heteroglossia between the written and spoken forms of the language.[39] Two styles of writing have emerged, involving somewhat different vocabularies and syntax:[74][76]\n\n\n\n1. *Shadhu-bhasha* (সাধু ভাষা \"upright language\") was the written language, with longer verb inflections and more of a Pali and Sanskrit-derived *Tatsama* vocabulary. Songs such as India's national anthem *Jana Gana Mana* (by Rabindranath Tagore) were composed in this style. Its use in modern writing however is uncommon, restricted to some official signs and documents in Bangladesh as well as for achieving particular literary effects.\n2. *Cholito-bhasha* (চলিত ভাষা \"running language\"), known by linguists as Standard Colloquial Bengali, is a written Bengali style exhibiting a preponderance of colloquial idiom and shortened verb forms and is the standard for written Bengali now. This form came into vogue towards the turn of the 19th century, promoted by the writings of Peary Chand Mitra (*Alaler Gharer Dulal*, 1857),[77] Pramatha Chaudhuri (*Sabujpatra*, 1914) and in the later writings of Rabindranath Tagore. It is modelled on the dialect spoken in the Shantipur and Shilaidaha region in Nadia and Kushtia Districts. This form of Bengali is often referred to as the \"Kushtia standard\"(Bangladesh), \"Nadia dialect\" (West Bengal), \"Southwestern/West-Central dialect\" \"Shantipuri Bangla\" or \"Shilaidahi Bangla\".[72]\n\n\nLinguist Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar categorises the language as:\n\n\n\n* Madhya Rarhi dialect\n* Kanthi (Contai) dialect\n* Kolkata dialect\n* Shantipuriya (Nadia) dialect\n* Shershahabadia (Maldahiya/ Jangipuri) dialect\n* Barendri dialect\n* Rangapuriya dialect\n* Sylheti dialect\n* Dhakiya (Bikrampuri) dialect\n* Jashore/Jessoriya dialect\n* Barisal (Chandradwip) dialect\n* Chattal (Chittagong) dialect\n\n\nWhile most writing is in Standard Colloquial Bengali (SCB), spoken dialects exhibit a greater variety. People in southeastern West Bengal, including Kolkata, speak in SCB. Other dialects, with minor variations from Standard Colloquial, are used in other parts of West Bengal and western Bangladesh, such as the Midnapore dialect, characterised by some unique words and constructions. However, a majority in Bangladesh speaks dialects notably different from SCB. Some dialects, particularly those of the Chittagong region, bear only a superficial resemblance to SCB.[78] The dialect in the Chittagong region is least widely understood by the general body of Bengalis.[78] The majority of Bengalis are able to communicate in more than one variety – often, speakers are fluent in *Cholitobhasha* (SCB) and one or more regional dialects.[40]\n\n\nEven in SCB, the vocabulary may differ according to the speaker's religion: Muslims are more likely to use words of Persian and Arabic origin, along with more words naturally derived from Sanskrit (tadbhava), whereas Hindus are more likely to use tatsama (words directly borrowed from Sanskrit).[79] For example:[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Predominantly Hindu usage | Origin | Predominantly Muslim usage | Origin | Translation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| নমস্কার *nômôskār* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *namaskāra* | আসসালামু আলাইকুম *āssālāmu ālāikum* | Directly from Arabic *as-salāmu ʿalaykum* | hello\n |\n| নিমন্ত্রণ *nimôntrôṇ* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *nimantraṇa* as opposed to the native Bengali *nemôntônnô* | দাওয়াত *dāoyāt* | Borrowed from Arabic *da`wah* via Persian | invitation\n |\n| জল *jôl* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *jala* | পানি *pāni* | Native, compare with Sanskrit *pānīya* | water\n |\n| স্নান *snān* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *snāna* | গোসল *gosôl* | Borrowed from Arabic *ghusl* via Persian | bath\n |\n| দিদি *didi* | Native, from Sanskrit *devī* | আপা *āpā* | From Turkic languages | sister / elder sister\n |\n| দাদা *dādā* | Native, from Sanskrit *dāyāda* | ভাইয়া *bhāiyā* | Native, from Sanskrit *bhrātā* | brother / elder brother[80] |\n| মাসী *māsī* | Native, from Sanskrit *mātṛṣvasā* | খালা *khālā* | Directly borrowed from Arabic *khālah* | maternal aunt\n |\n| পিসী *pisī* | Native, from Sanskrit *pitṛṣvasā* | ফুফু *phuphu* | Native, from Prakrit *phupphī* | paternal aunt\n |\n| কাকা *kākā* | From Persian or Dravidian *kākā* | চাচা *cācā* | From Prakrit *cācca* | paternal uncle\n |\n| প্রার্থনা *prārthonā* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *prārthanā* | দোয়া *doyā* | Borrowed from Arabic *du`āʾ* | prayer\n |\n| প্রদীপ *prôdīp* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *pradīp* | বাতি *bāti* | Native, compare with Prakrit *batti* and Sanskrit *barti* | lamp\n |\n| লঙ্কা *lônkā* | Native, named after Lanka | মরিচ *môric* | Directly borrowed from Sanskrit *marica* | chilli\n |\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali phonology\n\nThe phonemic inventory of standard Bengali consists of 29 consonants and 7 vowels, as well as 7 nasalised vowels. The inventory is set out below in the International Phonetic Alphabet (upper grapheme in each box) and romanisation (lower grapheme).\n\n\n\n\n\nVowels\n|  | Front | Central | Back |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Close | ই~ঈii |  | উ~ঊuu\n |\n| Close-mid | এee |  | ওoo\n |\n| Open-mid | অ্যাæ æ |  | অɔô\n |\n| Open |  | আaa |  |\n\n\n\n\nNasalized vowels\n|  | Front | Central | Back |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Close | ইঁ~ঈঁĩĩ\n |  | উঁ~ঊঁũũ\n |\n| Close-mid | এঁẽẽ |  | ওঁõõ\n |\n| Open-mid | এ্যাঁ / অ্যাঁæ̃æ̃\n |  | অঁɔ̃ɔ̃\n |\n| Open |  | আঁ ãã\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nConsonants\n|  | Labial | Dental/Alveolar | Retroflex | Palato-alveolar | Velar | Glottal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nasal | m | n |  |  | ŋ |  |\n| Plosive/Affricate | voiceless | unaspirated | p | t | ʈ | tʃ | k |  |\n| aspirated | pʰ | tʰ | ʈʰ | tʃʰ | kʰ |  |\n| voiced | unaspirated | b | d | ɖ | dʒ | ɡ |  |\n| aspirated | bʱ | dʱ | ɖʱ | dʒʱ | ɡʱ |  |\n| Fricative | voiceless | (ɸ) | s |  | ʃ |  | (h)\n |\n| voiced | (β) | (z) |  |  |  | ɦ |\n| Approximant | (w) | l |  | (j) |  |  |\n| Rhotic | unaspirated |  | r | ɽ |  |  |  |\n| aspirated |  |  | (ɽʱ) |  |  |  |\n\n\nBengali is known for its wide variety of diphthongs, combinations of vowels occurring within the same syllable.[81] Two of these, /oi̯/ and /ou̯/, are the only ones with representation in script, as ঐ and ঔ respectively. /e̯ i̯ o̯ u̯/ may all form the glide part of a diphthong. The total number of diphthongs is not established, with bounds at 17 and 31. An incomplete chart is given by Sarkar (1985) of the following:[82]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | e̯ | i̯ | o̯ | u̯ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| a | ae̯ | ai̯ | ao̯ | au̯ |\n| æ | æe̯ |  | æo̯ |  |\n| e |  | ei̯ |  | eu̯ |\n| i |  | ii̯ |  | iu̯ |\n| o | oe̯ | oi̯ | oo̯ | ou̯ |\n| u |  | ui̯ |  |  |\n\n\n### Stress[edit]\n\n\nIn standard Bengali, stress is predominantly initial. Bengali words are virtually all trochaic; the primary stress falls on the initial syllable of the word, while secondary stress often falls on all odd-numbered syllables thereafter, giving strings such as in সহযোগিতা ***shô**-hô-**jo**-gi-**ta*** \"cooperation\", where the **boldface** represents primary and secondary stress.\n\n\n\n### Consonant clusters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali consonant clusters\n\nNative Bengali words do not allow initial consonant clusters;[83] the maximum syllabic structure is CVC (i.e., one vowel flanked by a consonant on each side). Many speakers of Bengali restrict their phonology to this pattern, even when using Sanskrit or English borrowings, such as গেরাম *geram* (CV.CVC) for গ্রাম *gram* (CCVC) \"village\" or ইস্কুল *iskul* (VC.CVC) for স্কুল *skul* (CCVC) \"school\".\n\n\n\n## Writing system[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bengali-Assamese Script, Bengali alphabet, and Bengali Braille\n\n![](image)An example of handwritten Bengali. Part of a poem written in Bengali (and with its English translation below each Bengali paragraph) by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore in 1926 in Hungary\n![](image)The Library of Whitechapel in East London with the word \"বাংলা\" illuminated in its front.\nBengali-Assamese script is an abugida, a script with letters for consonants, diacritics for vowels, and in which an inherent vowel (অ *ô*) is assumed for consonants if no vowel is marked.[84] The Bengali alphabet is used throughout Bangladesh and eastern India (Assam, West Bengal, Tripura). The Bengali alphabet is believed to have evolved from a modified Brahmic script around 1000 CE (or 10th–11th century).[85] It is a cursive script with eleven graphemes or signs denoting nine vowels and two diphthongs, and thirty-nine graphemes representing consonants and other modifiers.[85] There are no distinct upper and lower case letter forms. The letters run from left to right and spaces are used to separate orthographic words. Bengali script has a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the graphemes that links them together called মাত্রা *matra*.[86]\n\n\nSince the Bengali script is an abugida, its consonant graphemes usually do not represent phonetic segments, but carry an \"inherent\" vowel and thus are syllabic in nature. The inherent vowel is usually a back vowel, either [ɔ] as in মত [m**ɔ**t] \"opinion\" or [o], as in মন [m**o**n] \"mind\", with variants like the more open [ɒ]. To emphatically represent a consonant sound without any inherent vowel attached to it, a special diacritic, called the *hôsôntô* (্), may be added below the basic consonant grapheme (as in ম্ [m]). This diacritic, however, is not common and is chiefly employed as a guide to pronunciation. The abugida nature of Bengali consonant graphemes is not consistent, however. Often, syllable-final consonant graphemes, though not marked by a *hôsôntô*, may carry no inherent vowel sound (as in the final ন in মন [m**o**n] or the medial ম in গামলা [ɡamla]).\n\n\nA consonant sound followed by some vowel sound other than the inherent [ɔ] is orthographically realised by using a variety of vowel allographs above, below, before, after, or around the consonant sign, thus forming the ubiquitous consonant-vowel typographic ligatures. These allographs, called কার *kar*, are diacritical vowel forms and cannot stand on their own. For example, the graph মি [mi] represents the consonant [m] followed by the vowel [i], where [i] is represented as the diacritical allographি (called ই-কার *i-kar*) and is placed *before* the default consonant sign. Similarly, the graphs মা [ma], মী [mi], মু [mu], মূ [mu], মৃ [mri], মে [me~mɛ], মৈ [moj], মো [mo] and মৌ [mow] represent the same consonant ম combined with seven other vowels and two diphthongs. In these consonant-vowel ligatures, the so-called \"inherent\" vowel [ɔ] is first expunged from the consonant before adding the vowel, but this intermediate expulsion of the inherent vowel is not indicated in any visual manner on the basic consonant sign ম [mɔ].\n\n\nThe vowel graphemes in Bengali can take two forms: the independent form found in the basic inventory of the script and the dependent, abridged, allograph form (as discussed above). To represent a vowel in isolation from any preceding or following consonant, the independent form of the vowel is used. For example, in মই [moj] \"ladder\" and in ইলিশ [iliʃ] \"Hilsa fish\", the independent form of the vowel ই is used (cf. the dependent formি). A vowel at the beginning of a word is always realised using its independent form.\n\n\nIn addition to the inherent-vowel-suppressing *hôsôntô*, three more diacritics are commonly used in Bengali. These are the superposed *chôndrôbindu* (ঁ), denoting a suprasegmental for nasalisation of vowels (as in চাঁদ [tʃãd] \"moon\"), the postposed *ônusbar* (ং) indicating the velar nasal [ŋ] (as in বাংলা [baŋla] \"Bengali\") and the postposed *bisôrgô* (ঃ) indicating the voiceless glottal fricative [h] (as in উঃ! [uh] \"ouch!\") or the gemination of the following consonant (as in দুঃখ [dukʰːɔ] \"sorrow\").\n\n\nThe Bengali consonant clusters (যুক্তব্যঞ্জন *juktôbênjôn*) are usually realised as ligatures, where the consonant which comes first is put on top of or to the left of the one that immediately follows. In these ligatures, the shapes of the constituent consonant signs are often contracted and sometimes even distorted beyond recognition. In the Bengali writing system, there are nearly 285 such ligatures denoting consonant clusters. Although there exist a few visual formulas to construct some of these ligatures, many of them have to be learned by rote. Recently, in a bid to lessen this burden on young learners, efforts have been made by educational institutions in the two main Bengali-speaking regions (West Bengal and Bangladesh) to address the opaque nature of many consonant clusters, and as a result, modern Bengali textbooks are beginning to contain more and more \"transparent\" graphical forms of consonant clusters, in which the constituent consonants of a cluster are readily apparent from the graphical form. However, since this change is not as widespread and is not being followed as uniformly in the rest of the Bengali printed literature, today's Bengali-learning children will possibly have to learn to recognise both the new \"transparent\" and the old \"opaque\" forms, which ultimately amounts to an increase in learning burden.\n\n\nBengali punctuation marks, apart from the downstroke । *daṛi* – the Bengali equivalent of a full stop – have been adopted from Western scripts and their usage is similar.[87]\n\n\nUnlike in Western scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, etc.) where the letter forms stand on an invisible baseline, the Bengali letter-forms instead hang from a visible horizontal left-to-right headstroke called মাত্রা *matra*. The presence and absence of this matra can be important. For example, the letter ত *tô* and the numeral ৩ \"3\" are distinguishable only by the presence or absence of the *matra*, as is the case between the consonant cluster ত্র *trô* and the independent vowel এ *e*, also the letter হ *hô* and Bengali Ôbogroho ঽ *(~ô)* and letter ও *o* and consonant cluster ত্ত *ttô*. The letter-forms also employ the concepts of letter-width and letter-height (the vertical space between the visible matra and an invisible baseline).\n\n\nThere is yet to be a uniform standard collating sequence (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for this problem.\n\n\n\n### Alternative and historic scripts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An 1855 Dobhashi manuscript of *Halat-un-Nabi* written by Sadeq Ali using the Sylheti Nagri script.\nThroughout history, there have been instances of the Bengali language being written in different scripts, though these employments were never popular on a large scale and were communally limited. Owing to Bengal's geographic location, Bengali areas bordering non-Bengali regions have been influenced by each other. Small numbers of people in Midnapore, which borders Odisha, have used the Odia script to write in Bengali. In the border areas between West Bengal and Bihar, some Bengali communities historically wrote Bengali in Devanagari, Kaithi and Tirhuta.[88]\n\n\nIn Sylhet and Bankura, modified versions of the Kaithi script had some historical prominence, mainly among Muslim communities. The variant in Sylhet was identical to the Baitali Kaithi script of Hindustani with the exception of Sylhet Nagri possessing *matra*.[89] Sylhet Nagri was standardised for printing in c. 1869.[14]\n\n\nUp until the 19th century, numerous variations of the Arabic script had been used across Bengal from Chittagong in the east to Meherpur in the west.[90][91][92] The 14th-century court scholar of Bengal, Nur Qutb Alam, composed Bengali poetry using the Persian alphabet.[93][94] After the Partition of India in the 20th century, the Pakistani government attempted to institute the Perso-Arabic script as the standard for Bengali in East Pakistan; this was met with resistance and contributed to the Bengali language movement.[95]\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Portuguese missionaries began a tradition of using the Roman alphabet to transcribe the Bengali language. Though the Portuguese standard did not receive much growth, a few Roman Bengali works relating to Christianity and Bengali grammar were printed as far as Lisbon in 1743. The Portuguese were followed by the English and French respectively, whose works were mostly related to Bengali grammar and transliteration. The first version of the Aesop's Fables in Bengali was printed using Roman letters based on English phonology by the Scottish linguist John Gilchrist. Consecutive attempts to establish a Roman Bengali have continued across every century since these times, and have been supported by the likes of Suniti Kumar Chatterji, Muhammad Qudrat-i-Khuda, and Muhammad Enamul Haq.[96] The Digital Revolution has also played a part in the adoption of the English alphabet to write Bengali,[97] with certain social media influencers publishing entire novels in Roman Bengali.[98]\n\n\nBengali script like others does have Schwa deletion. It does not mark when the inherent vowel is not used (mainly at the end of words)\n\n\n\n### Orthographic depth[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

But grapheme-phoneme inconsistencies do occur in certain cases.\n\n\nOne kind of inconsistency is due to the presence of several letters in the script for the same sound. In spite of some modifications in the 19th century, the Bengali spelling system continues to be based on the one used for Sanskrit,[87] and thus does not take into account some sound mergers that have occurred in the spoken language. For example, there are three letters (শ, ষ, and স) for the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ], although the letter স retains the voiceless alveolar sibilant [s] sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in স্খলন [skʰɔlon] \"fall\", স্পন্দন [spɔndon] \"beat\", etc. The letter ষ also, sometimes, retains the voiceless retroflex sibilant [ʂ] sound when used in certain consonant conjuncts as in কষ্ট [kɔʂʈo] \"suffering\", গোষ্ঠী [ɡoʂʈʰi] \"clan\", etc. Similarly, there are two letters (জ and য) for the voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ]. Moreover, what was once pronounced and written as a retroflex nasal ণ [ɳ] is now pronounced as an alveolar [n] when in conversation (the difference is heard when reading) (unless conjoined with another retroflex consonant such as ট, ঠ, ড and ঢ), although the spelling does not reflect this change. The near-open front unrounded vowel [æ] is orthographically realised by multiple means, as seen in the following examples: এত [æto] \"so much\", এ্যাকাডেমী [ækademi] \"academy\", অ্যামিবা [æmiba] \"amoeba\", দেখা [dækʰa] \"to see\", ব্যস্ত [bæsto] \"busy\", ব্যাকরণ [bækorɔn] \"grammar\".\n\n\nAnother kind of inconsistency is concerned with the incomplete coverage of phonological information in the script. The inherent vowel attached to every consonant can be either [ɔ] or [o] depending on vowel harmony (স্বরসঙ্গতি) with the preceding or following vowel or on the context, but this phonological information is not captured by the script, creating ambiguity for the reader. Furthermore, the inherent vowel is often not pronounced at the end of a syllable, as in কম [kɔm] \"less\", but this omission is not generally reflected in the script, making it difficult for the new reader.\n\n\nMany consonant clusters have different sounds than their constituent consonants. For example, the combination of the consonants ক্ [k] and ষ [ʂ] is graphically realised as ক্ষ and is pronounced [kkʰo] (as in রুক্ষ [rukkʰo] \"coarse\"), [kʰɔ] (as in ক্ষমতা [kʰɔmota] \"capability\") or even [kʰo] (as in ক্ষতি [kʰoti] \"harm\"), depending on the position of the cluster in a word. The Bengali writing system is, therefore, not always a true guide to pronunciation.\n\n\n\n### Uses[edit]\n\n\nThe script used for Bengali, Assamese, and other languages is known as Bengali script. The script is known as the Bengali alphabet for Bengali and its dialects and the Assamese alphabet for Assamese language with some minor variations. Other related languages in the nearby region also make use of the Bengali script like the Meitei language in the Indian state of Manipur, where the Meitei language has been written in the Bengali script for centuries, though the Meitei script has been promoted in recent times.\n\n\n\n### Number system[edit]\n\n\nBengali digits are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 5\n | 6\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ০\n | ১\n | ২\n | ৩\n | ৪\n | ৫\n | ৬\n | ৭\n | ৮\n | ৯\n |\n\n\nThere are additional digits for fractions and prices, though they are little used any longer.[*vague*]\n\n\n\n### Romanisation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Romanisation of Bengali\n\nThere are various romanisation systems used for Bengali created in recent years which have failed to represent the true Bengali phonetic sound. The Bengali alphabet has often been included with the group of Brahmic scripts for romanisation where the true phonetic value of Bengali is never represented. Some of them are the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration, or IAST system (based on diacritics);[99] \"Indian languages Transliteration\", or ITRANS (uses upper case letters suited for ASCII keyboards);[100] and the National Library at Kolkata romanisation.[101]\n\n\nIn the context of Bengali romanisation, it is important to distinguish transliteration from transcription. Transliteration is orthographically accurate (i.e. the original spelling can be recovered), whereas transcription is phonetically accurate (the pronunciation can be reproduced).\n\n\nAlthough it might be desirable to use a transliteration scheme where the original Bengali orthography is recoverable from the Latin text, Bengali words are currently romanised on Wikipedia using a phonemic transcription, where the true phonetic pronunciation of Bengali is represented with no reference to how it is written.\n\n\nThe most recent attempt has been by publishers Mitra and Ghosh with the launch of three popular children's books, *Abol Tabol*, *Hasi Khusi* and *Sahoj Path*, in Roman script at the Kolkata Book Fair 2018. Published under the imprint of Benglish Books, these are based on phonetic transliteration and closely follow spellings used in social media but for using an underline to describe soft consonants.\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bengali grammar\n\nBengali nouns are not assigned gender, which leads to minimal changing of adjectives (inflection). However, nouns and pronouns are moderately declined (altered depending on their function in a sentence) into four cases while verbs are heavily conjugated, and the verbs do not change form depending on the gender of the nouns.\n\n\n\n### Word order[edit]\n\n\nAs a head-final language, Bengali follows a subject–object–verb word order, although variations on this theme are common.[102] Bengali makes use of postpositions, as opposed to the prepositions used in English and other European languages. Determiners follow the noun, while numerals, adjectives, and possessors precede the noun.[103]\n\n\nYes–no questions do not require any change to the basic word order; instead, the low (L) tone of the final syllable in the utterance is replaced with a falling (HL) tone. Additionally, optional particles (e.g. কি *-ki*, না *-na*, etc.) are often encliticised onto the first or last word of a yes–no question.\n\n\nWh-questions are formed by fronting the wh-word to focus position, which is typically the first or second word in the utterance.\n\n\n\n### Nouns[edit]\n\n\nNouns and pronouns are inflected for case, including nominative, objective, genitive (possessive), and locative.[30] The case marking pattern for each noun being inflected depends on the noun's degree of animacy. When a definite article such as -টা *-ṭa* (singular) or -গুলো *-gulo* (plural) is added, as in the tables below, nouns are also inflected for number.\n\n\nIn most of Bengali grammar books, cases are divided into 6 categories and an additional possessive case (the possessive form is not recognised as a type of case by Bengali grammarians). But in terms of usage, cases are generally grouped into only 4 categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nSingular noun inflection\n|  | Animate\n | Inanimate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nominative\n | ছাত্রটিchatrô-ṭi\nছাত্রটিchatrô-ṭithe student\n | জুতোটিjuto-ṭa\nজুতোটিjuto-ṭathe shoe\n |\n| Objective\n | ছাত্রটি**কে**chatrô-ṭi-**ke**\nছাত্রটি**কে**chatrô-ṭi-**ke**the student\n | জুতোটাjuto-ṭa\nজুতোটাjuto-ṭathe shoe\n |\n| Genitive\n | ছাত্রটি**র**chatrô-ṭi-**r**\nছাত্রটি**র**chatrô-ṭi-**r**the student's\n | জুতোটা**র**juto-ṭa-**r**\nজুতোটা**র**juto-ṭa-**r**the shoe's\n |\n| Locative\n | –\n | জুতোটা**য়**juto-ṭa-**y**\nজুতোটা**য়**juto-ṭa-**y**on/in the shoe\n |\n\n | \n\nPlural noun inflection\n|  | Animate\n | Inanimate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nominative\n | ছাত্র**রা**chatrô-**ra**\n/\nছাত্রগণ\nছাত্র**রা** / ছাত্রগণchatrô-**ra** {} {}the students\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলোjuto-gulo\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলোjuta-gula / juto-gulothe shoes\n |\n| Objective\n | ছাত্র**দের(কে)**chatrô-**der(ke)**\nছাত্র**দের(কে)**chatrô-**der(ke)**the students\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলোjuto-gulo\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলোjuta-gula / juto-gulothe shoes\n |\n| Genitive\n | ছাত্র**দের**chatrô-**der**\nছাত্র**দের**chatrô-**der**the students'\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলো**র**juto-gulo-**r**\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলো**র**juta-gula / juto-gulo-**r**the shoes'\n |\n| Locative\n | –\n | জুতাগুলাjuta-gula\n//\nজুতোগুলো**তে**juto-gulo-**te**\nজুতাগুলা / জুতোগুলো**তে**juta-gula / juto-gulo-**te**on/in the shoes\n |\n\n |\n\n\nWhen counted, nouns take one of a small set of measure words. Nouns in Bengali cannot be counted by adding the numeral directly adjacent to the noun. An appropriate measure word (**MW**), a classifier, must be used between the numeral and the noun (most languages of the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area are similar in this respect). Most nouns take the generic measure word -টা *-ṭa*, though other measure words indicate semantic classes (e.g. -জন *-jôn* for humans). There is also the classifier *-khana,* and its diminutive form *-khani*, which attaches only to nouns denoting something flat, long, square, or thin. These are the least common of the classifiers.[104]\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure words\n| Example\n |\n| --- |\n| নয়**টা**Nôy-**ṭa**nine-**MW**\nগরুgorucow\nনয়**টা** গরুNôy-**ṭa** gorunine-**MW** cowNine cows\n |\n| কয়**টা**Kôy-**ṭa**how many-**MW**\nবালিশbalishpillow\nকয়**টা** বালিশKôy-**ṭa** balish{how many}-**MW** pillowHow many pillows\n |\n| অনেক**জন**Ônek-**jôn**many-**MW**\nলোকlokperson\nঅনেক**জন** লোকÔnek-**jôn** lokmany-**MW** personMany people\n |\n| চার-পাঁচ**জন**Ĉar-pãc-**jôn**four-five-**MW**\nশিক্ষকshikkhôkteacher\nচার-পাঁচ**জন** শিক্ষকĈar-pãc-**jôn** shikkhôkfour-five-**MW** teacherFour to five teachers\n |\n\n\nMeasuring nouns in Bengali without their corresponding measure words (e.g. আট বিড়াল *aṭ biṛal* instead of আট**টা** বিড়াল *aṭ-**ṭa** biṛal* \"eight cats\") would typically be considered ungrammatical. However, when the semantic class of the noun is understood from the measure word, the noun is often omitted and only the measure word is used, e.g. শুধু এক**জন** থাকবে। *Shudhu êk-**jôn** thakbe.* (lit. \"Only one-**MW** will remain.\") would be understood to mean \"Only one **person** will remain.\", given the semantic class implicit in -জন *-jôn*.\n\n\nIn this sense, all nouns in Bengali, unlike most other Indo-European languages, are similar to mass nouns.\n\n\n\n### Verbs[edit]\n\n\nThere are two classes of verbs: finite and non-finite. Non-finite verbs have no inflection for tense or person, while finite verbs are fully inflected for person (first, second, third), tense (present, past, future), aspect (simple, perfect, progressive), and honour (intimate, familiar, and formal), but *not* for number. Conditional, imperative, and other special inflections for mood can replace the tense and aspect suffixes. The number of inflections on many verb roots can total more than 200.\n\n\nInflectional suffixes in the morphology of Bengali vary from region to region, along with minor differences in syntax.\n\n\nBengali differs from most Indo-Aryan Languages in the zero copula, where the copula or connective *be* is often missing in the present tense.[87] Thus, \"he is a teacher\" is সে শিক্ষক *se shikkhôk*, (literally \"he teacher\").[105] In this respect, Bengali is similar to Russian and Hungarian. Romani grammar is also the closest to Bengali grammar.[106]\n\n\n\n## Vocabulary[edit]\n\n\nSources of modern literary Bengali words\n\n\n\nNative (67%)\nSanskrit borrowings (25%)\nIndigenous and foreign loans (8%)\nMain article: Bengali vocabulary\n\nBengali has as many as 100,000 separate words, of which 50,000 are considered Tadbhavas, 21,100 are Tatsamas and the remainder loanwords from Austroasiatic and other foreign languages.\n\n\nHowever, these figures do not take into account the large proportion of archaic or highly technical words that are very rarely used. Furthermore, different dialects use more Persian and Arabic vocabulary, especially in different areas of Bangladesh and Muslim majority areas of West Bengal. Hindus, on the other hand, use more Sanskrit vocabulary than Muslims. Standard Bengali is based on the Nadia dialect spoken in the Hindu-majority states of West Bengal and parts of the Muslim-majority division of Khulna in Bangladesh. About 90% of Bengalis in Bangladesh (ca. 148 million) and 27% of Bengalis in West Bengal and 10% in Assam (ca. 36 million) are Muslim and the Bangladeshi Muslims and some of the Indian Bengali Muslims speak a more \"persio-arabised\" version of Bengali instead of the more Sanskrit influenced Standard Nadia dialect although the majority of the Indian Bengalis of West Bengal speaks in Rarhi dialect irrespective of religion. The productive vocabulary used in modern literary works, in fact, is made up mostly (67%) of Tadbhavas, while Tatsamas make up only 25% of the total.[107][108] Loanwords from non-Indic languages account for the remaining 8% of the vocabulary used in modern Bengali literature.\n\n\nAccording to Suniti Kumar Chatterji, dictionaries from the early 20th century attributed a little more than 50% of the Bengali vocabulary to native words (i.e., naturally modified Sanskrit words, corrupted forms of Sanskrit words, and loanwords non-Indo-European languages). About 45% per cent of Bengali words are unmodified Sanskrit, and the remaining words are from foreign languages.[109] Dominant in the last group was Persian, which was also the source of some grammatical forms. More recent studies suggest that the use of native and foreign words has been increasing, mainly because of the preference of Bengali speakers for the colloquial style.[109] Because of centuries of contact with Europeans, Turkic peoples, and Persians, Bengali has absorbed numerous words from foreign languages, often totally integrating these borrowings into the core vocabulary.\n\n\nThe most common borrowings from foreign languages come from three different kinds of contact. After close contact with several indigenous Austroasiatic languages,[110][111][112][113] and later the Mughal conquest whose court language was Persian, numerous Chagatai, Arabic, and Persian words were absorbed into the lexicon.[41]\n\n\nLater, East Asian travellers and lately European colonialism brought words from Portuguese, French, Dutch, and most significantly English during the colonial period.\n\n\n\n## Sample text[edit]\n\n\nThe following is a sample text in Bengali of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\n\n\nসমস্ত\n\nSômôstô\n\nʃɔmosto\n\nAll\nমানুষ\n\nmanush\n\nmanuʃ\n\nhuman\nস্বাধীনভাবে\n\nshadhinbhabe\n\nʃadʱinbʱabe\n\nfree-manner-in\nসমান\n\nsôman\n\nʃoman\n\nequal\nমর্যাদা\n\nmôrjada\n\nmɔɾdʒada\n\ndignity\nএবং\n\nebông\n\neboŋ\n\nand\nঅধিকার\n\nôdhikar\n\nodʱikaɾ\n\nright\nনিয়ে\n\nniye\n\nnie̯e\n\ntaken\nজন্মগ্রহণ\n\njônmôgrôhôn\n\ndʒɔnmoɡrohon\n\nbirth-take\nকরে।\n\nkôre.\n\nkɔɾe\n\ndo.\nতাঁদের\n\nTãder\n\ntãdeɾ\n\nTheir\nবিবেক\n\nbibek\n\nbibek\n\nreason\nএবং\n\nebông\n\neboŋ\n\nand\nবুদ্ধি\n\nbuddhi\n\nbudʱːi\n\nintelligence\nআছে;\n\nachhe;\n\natʃʰe\n\nexist;\nসুতরাং\n\nsutôrang\n\nʃutoraŋ\n\ntherefore\nসকলেরই\n\nsôkôleri\n\nʃɔkoleɾi\n\neveryone-indeed\nএকে\n\nêke\n\nɛke\n\none\nঅপরের\n\nôpôrer\n\nɔporeɾ\n\nanother's\nপ্রতি\n\nprôti\n\nproti\n\ntowards\nভ্রাতৃত্বসুলভ\n\nbhratrittôsulôbh\n\nbʱratritːoʃulɔbʱ\n\nbrotherhood-ly\nমনোভাব\n\nmônobhab\n\nmonobʱab\n\nattitude\nনিয়ে\n\nniye\n\nnie̯e\n\ntaken\nআচরণ\n\nachôrôn\n\natʃorɔn\n\nconduct\nকরা\n\nkôra\n\nkɔra\n\ndo\nউচিত।\n\nuchit.\n\nutʃit\n\nshould.\nসমস্ত মানুষ স্বাধীনভাবে সমান মর্যাদা এবং অধিকার নিয়ে জন্মগ্রহণ করে। তাঁদের বিবেক এবং বুদ্ধি আছে; সুতরাং সকলেরই একে অপরের প্রতি ভ্রাতৃত্বসুলভ মনোভাব নিয়ে আচরণ করা উচিত।\n\nSômôstô manush shadhinbhabe sôman môrjada ebông ôdhikar niye jônmôgrôhôn kôre.
