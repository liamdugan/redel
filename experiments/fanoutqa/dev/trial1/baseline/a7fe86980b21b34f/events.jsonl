Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public.

The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum covers Asian, Mediterranean, and Islamic art, the Busch–Reisinger Museum (formerly the Germanic Museum) covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art.

Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.[107]\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Founded\n | Enrollment\n | U.S. News & World Report |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Harvard University\n | 1636\n | 31,345[108] | 3[109] |\n| Medicine | 1782\n | 660\n | 1[110] |\n| Divinity | 1816\n | 377\n | N/A\n |\n| Law | 1817\n | 1,990\n | 4[111] |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n | 280\n | N/A\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n | 4,824\n | N/A\n |\n| Business | 1908\n | 2,011\n | 5[112] |\n| Extension | 1910\n | 3,428\n | N/A\n |\n| Design | 1914\n | 878\n | N/A\n |\n| Education | 1920\n | 876\n | 2[113] |\n| Public Health | 1922\n | 1,412\n | 3[112] |\n| Government | 1936\n | 1,100\n | 6[114] |\n| Engineering | 2007\n | 1,750\n | 21[115] |\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[116] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 21%\n | 21 |\n| Hispanic | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Other[Notes 2] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[Notes 3] | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Affluent[Notes 4] | 82%\n | 82 |\n\n\nStudent life and activities are generally organized within each school.\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Council represents College students. The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7]\n\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\nAs of October 2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[11] 54 college founders and presidents, many heads of state, cabinet members and governors. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 263 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, 81 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 102 Guggenheim Fellows and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Yale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A front view of Yale-College and the college chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786\nKnown from its origin as the \"Collegiate School\", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook in 1703 when the first treasurer of Yale, Nathaniel Lynde, donated land and a building. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718\nIn 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston-born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page needed*]\n\n\nSerious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[26] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nAs the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[28] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\nThe emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Brick Row in 1807\nThe Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[33]\n\n\nUntil 1887, the legal name of the university was \"The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven.\" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present \"Yale University\".[34]\n\n\n\n#### Sports and debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who \"regretted\" that he \"had but one life to lose\" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Dink Stover in the novel *Stover at Yale* (1912) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nAlong with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[36] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[37] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[38]\n\n\nIn 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nStarting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[a] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[40] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.\n\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[*citation needed*] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[41][*page needed*] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, noting he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woolsey Hall c. 1905\nMilton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[43] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[44]\n\n\n#### Women[edit]\n\n\nIn 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on the basis of her gender.[45] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[46] The first seven women to earn PhDs at Yale received their degrees in 1894: Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Cornelia H. B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\nA decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment, especially by male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, \"A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.\"[52] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price[53] (district attorney in Alameda County, California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John \"Jack\" J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall[54] (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and the coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[55] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine *Broad Recognition*, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[56] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[57] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures.\n\n\n\n#### Class[edit]\n\n\nYale instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see *numerus clausus*) and eliminated such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[58]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[59] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[59]\n\n\nIn 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: \"First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.\"[60]\n\n\nIn 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[61] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, \"Debating Globalization\".[62] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, \"Understanding Politics and Politicians\".[63] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but \"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL\".[64]\n\n\nIn August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[65]\n\n\nIn 2017, having been suggested for decades,[66] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for slave owner, anti-abolitionist, and white supremacist Vice President John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper College, after Grace Hopper).[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[69] Yale was president of Fort. St George in Madras, a fort of the East India Company in India, which was one of the biggest corporation in the world at the time. The company traded textiles, goods, diamonds, cotton, spices, among others, and was involved in the slave trade in India, with a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of Britain.[70]\nHis singularly large donation of paintings and books to the college led some critics to argue that Yale relied on money related to the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the US Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[75] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, later won a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Yale alumni in politics[edit]\n\n\nThe *Boston Globe* wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\".[77][*verification needed*] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[78] Yale-educated presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).\n\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[79][*verification needed*] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders\", an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[79] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\"[77] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the *Yale Daily News*.[80] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\"[81] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family\".[82] *New York Times* correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and *The Atlantic Monthly* correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[83]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| School founding\n |\n| --- |\n| **School** | **Year founded** |\n| Yale College | 1701\n |\n| Yale School of Medicine | 1810\n |\n| Yale Divinity School | 1822\n |\n| Yale Law School | 1824\n |\n| Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Sheffield Scientific School[a] | 1847\n |\n| Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science | 1852\n |\n| Yale School of Fine Arts | 1869\n |\n| Yale School of Music | 1894\n |\n| Yale School of the Environment | 1900\n |\n| Yale School of Public Health | 1915\n |\n| Yale School of Architecture | 1916\n |\n| Yale School of Nursing | 1923\n |\n| David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University | 1955\n |\n| Yale School of Management | 1976\n |\n| Jackson School of Global Affairs | 2022[40] |\n\n\nThe President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[85] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[86]\n\n\nYale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of Duke University.[97] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n### Staff and labor unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees\n\nYale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[99] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[100][101] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[102] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[99][103] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[104] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[105] In October 2014, after deliberation,[106] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[99][107]\n\n\nYale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[108][*page needed*] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and *The New York Times* wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[109] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[110] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[111] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[112]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building ![](image)Interior of Beinecke Library\nYale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[113] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[114] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[115] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[116]\n\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\nMany of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[121][122] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[123] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall\n![](image)Vanderbilt Hall\nOther examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[124] Phelps Hall,[125] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[126]\n\n\nThe oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures.\n\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[127] Near the library is a sunken courtyard with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[128] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as \"Beinecke Plaza\".\n\n\nAlumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[129] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[130] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[131] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[132]\n\n\nThe athletic field complex is partially in New Haven, and partially in West Haven.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nYale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013\n\n### Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harkness Tower\nNotable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Humanities Quadrangle, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London.\n\n\nYale's secret society buildings (some of which are called \"tombs\") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King-lui Wu with Dan Kiley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nYale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[134] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n* Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven\n* Marsh Botanical Garden\n* Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm\n\n\n### Relationship with New Haven[edit]\n\n\nYale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[140] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however, has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[141] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Town–gown relations[edit]\n\n\nYale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in myriad community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nSeveral campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[144][145] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[146][147] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[148] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among peer schools.[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\nThrough its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and the university is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[157] Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[158] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[156][159][160] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[156] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140 scholars).[161]\n\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\nRare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Night Café*, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\n\nThe Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[164] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[165] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[166] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[167] | 4 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[168] | 11 |\n| *QS*[169] | 16 |\n| *THE*[170] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[171] | 11 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 7\n |\n| Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Law\n | 1\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 59\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 10\n |\n| Nursing: doctorate\n | 21\n |\n| Nursing: Master's\n | 20\n |\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 6\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 12\n |\n| Clinical Psychology\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 20\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 19\n |\n| Economics\n | 4\n |\n| English\n | 1\n |\n| Fine Arts\n | 2\n |\n| History\n | 2\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 12\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery\n | 2\n |\n| Physician Assistant\n | 26\n |\n| Physics\n | 11\n |\n| Political Science\n | 6\n |\n| Psychology\n | 6\n |\n| Public Health\n | 11\n |\n| Sociology\n | 18\n |\n| Statistics\n | 13\n |\n\n\nThe *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Yale third among U.S. national universities for 2016,[153] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years. Yale University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[173]\n\n\nInternationally, Yale was ranked 11th in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, tenth in the 2016–17 Nature Index[174] for quality of scientific research output, and tenth in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.[175] The university was also ranked sixth in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings[176] and eighth in the Academic World Reputation Rankings.[177] In 2019, it ranked 27th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[178]\n\n\n\n### Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(March 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nYale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[179] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[180]\n\n\nYale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15] The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[181] It also is a top 10 (ranked seventh) baccalaureate source (after normalization for the number of graduates) of some of the most notable scientists (Nobel, Fields, Turing prizes, or membership in National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, or National Academy of Medicine).[182]\n\n\nYale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The *Journal of Music Theory* was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.\n\n\nSince the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).\n\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\n\n## Campus life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 24%\n | 24 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Affluent[d] | 80%\n | 80 |\n\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[186] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct.\n\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[187]\n  \n\n\n\n\n* ![Jonathan Edwards College courtyard](image)\n\nJonathan Edwards College courtyard\n* ![Branford College courtyard](image)\n\nBranford College courtyard\n* ![Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard](image)\n\nSaybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard\n* ![Hopper College courtyard](image)\n\nHopper College courtyard\n* ![Berkeley College buildings](image)\n\nBerkeley College buildings\n* ![Trumbull College courtyard](image)\n\nTrumbull College courtyard\n* ![Davenport College courtyard](image)\n\nDavenport College courtyard\n* ![Pierson College courtyard](image)\n\nPierson College courtyard\n* ![Silliman College courtyard](image)\n\nSilliman College courtyard\n* ![Timothy Dwight College courtyard](image)\n\nTimothy Dwight College courtyard\n* ![Morse College courtyard](image)\n\nMorse College courtyard\n* ![Ezra Stiles College courtyard](image)\n\nEzra Stiles College courtyard\n* ![Benjamin Franklin College courtyard](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin College courtyard\n* ![Pauli Murray College courtyard](image)\n\nPauli Murray College courtyard\n\n\n#### Calhoun College[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"—he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina\".[191] He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\"[188] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[192] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[193] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[194]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests\", Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[195] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future\". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\nDespite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Hopper in February 2017.[197] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[198][199][200] In his 2019 book *Assault on American Excellence*, former Dean of Yale Law School Anthony T. Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\nThe university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The Yale Literary Magazine, founded in February 1836, is the oldest student literary magazine in the United States.[203] Established in 1872, *The Yale Record* is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the *Yale Daily News*, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly *Yale Herald*, which was first published in 1986. The *Yale Journal of Medicine & Law* is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.\n\n\nDwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.\n\n\nThe Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.\n\n\nThe Yale Political Union (YPU) is a debate society founded in 1934 to host student discussions on a wide variety of topics. It is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki.\n\n\nThe Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the university's top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN, YMUN Korea, YMUN Taiwan and Yale Model African Union (YMAU), and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS), Yale International Relations Leadership Institute, and Hemispheres.\n\n\nThe campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men.\n\n\nThe Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the \"Lizzie's\" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's *Paradise Lost*, among other important literary texts.\n\n\n\n#### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale secret societies\n\nYale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Brothers in Unity, Linonia, St. Anthony Hall, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Daughters of Sovereign Government (DSG), Mace and Chain, ISO, Spade and Grave, and Sage and Chalice, among others. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[207]\n\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale Bulldogs\n\n![](image)The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium\nYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.\n\n\nYale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural \"bowl\" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[214]\n\n\nIn 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale – against the wishes of the NCAA – playing its Jewish center Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster.[215][216][217][218] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.[219]\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220]\n\n![](image)The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex\nIn May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first-ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[221] and were the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[222]\n\n\nYale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race.\n\n\nIn 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[223]\n\n\nYale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[224][225]\n\n\nYale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. \"Precision\" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[226] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.\n\n\nYale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about 10 different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.\n\n\n\n#### Song[edit]\n\n\nNotable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, \"Bright College Years\". Despite its popularity, \"Boola Boola\" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, \"Bulldog\" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[227] Additionally, two other songs, \"Down the Field\" by C.W. O'Conner, and \"Bingo Eli Yale\", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to *College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology* published in 1998, \"Down the Field\" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe school mascot is \"Handsome Dan\", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, \"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow.\" The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[229] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[230]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nYale has faced significant criticism for its handling of student mental health on campus.[231][232][233][234] Suicidal and depressed students say that Yale forced them to medically withdraw rather than provide them with academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in 2018 the Ruderman Family Foundation ranked Yale as having the worst mental health policies in the Ivy League.[235][236][233]\n\n\n\n> \n> Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted. Love, Luchang.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nLuchang Wang, posted on Facebook in 2015 shortly before her death[231][234][237][238][239]\n\nStudents at Yale say that the university's policies force them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to leave.[231][235][234] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015, who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted.[237][234][239] Wang had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably more difficult for her.[237][234] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to her university therapist to avoid being kicked out,[237] and another student said that many at Yale lie to their counselors as \"there's no clear standard established that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for\".[234] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to \"reinstatement\" as well as eliminating the $50 reapplication fee.[231]\n\n\nFor students that do seek help, waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only 30 minutes in length.[231] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes.[232] In 2023, after a lawsuit was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination, the university changed the name of a \"medical withdrawal\" to a \"medical leave of absence\" saying that the \"leave of absence\" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's insurance while away from the school.[240] The new policy also allowed for students on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus,[240] something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing.[231] A representative of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies \"misrepresents our efforts and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success are our primary focus\" and that \"the mental health of our students is a very, very high priority\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Benefactors[edit]\n\n\nYale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale, Jeremiah Dummer, the Vanderbilt family, the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William), the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter), John William Sterling, Payne Whitney, Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, William K. Lanman, and Stephen Schwarzman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[241] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[242] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[243] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built, while a $150 million contribution[244] by David Geffen enabled the Yale School of Drama (renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale) to become tuition-free as well.\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yale University people, List of Yale Law School alumni, and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Yale University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

For example, Owen Johnson's novel *Stover at Yale* follows the college career of Dink Stover,[379] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[380][381] Yale University also is mentioned in F.

Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7]\n\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\nAs of October 2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[11] 54 college founders and presidents, many heads of state, cabinet members and governors. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 263 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, 81 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 102 Guggenheim Fellows and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Yale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A front view of Yale-College and the college chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786\nKnown from its origin as the \"Collegiate School\", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook in 1703 when the first treasurer of Yale, Nathaniel Lynde, donated land and a building. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718\nIn 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston-born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page needed*]\n\n\nSerious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[26] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nAs the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[28] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\nThe emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Brick Row in 1807\nThe Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[33]\n\n\nUntil 1887, the legal name of the university was \"The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven.\" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present \"Yale University\".[34]\n\n\n\n#### Sports and debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who \"regretted\" that he \"had but one life to lose\" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Dink Stover in the novel *Stover at Yale* (1912) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nAlong with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[36] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[37] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[38]\n\n\nIn 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nStarting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[a] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[40] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.\n\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[*citation needed*] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[41][*page needed*] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, noting he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woolsey Hall c. 1905\nMilton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[43] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[44]\n\n\n#### Women[edit]\n\n\nIn 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on the basis of her gender.[45] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[46] The first seven women to earn PhDs at Yale received their degrees in 1894: Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Cornelia H. B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\nA decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment, especially by male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, \"A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.\"[52] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price[53] (district attorney in Alameda County, California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John \"Jack\" J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall[54] (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and the coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[55] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine *Broad Recognition*, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[56] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[57] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures.\n\n\n\n#### Class[edit]\n\n\nYale instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see *numerus clausus*) and eliminated such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[58]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[59] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[59]\n\n\nIn 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: \"First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.\"[60]\n\n\nIn 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[61] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, \"Debating Globalization\".[62] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, \"Understanding Politics and Politicians\".[63] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but \"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL\".[64]\n\n\nIn August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[65]\n\n\nIn 2017, having been suggested for decades,[66] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for slave owner, anti-abolitionist, and white supremacist Vice President John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper College, after Grace Hopper).[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[69] Yale was president of Fort. St George in Madras, a fort of the East India Company in India, which was one of the biggest corporation in the world at the time. The company traded textiles, goods, diamonds, cotton, spices, among others, and was involved in the slave trade in India, with a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of Britain.[70]\nHis singularly large donation of paintings and books to the college led some critics to argue that Yale relied on money related to the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the US Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[75] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, later won a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Yale alumni in politics[edit]\n\n\nThe *Boston Globe* wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\".[77][*verification needed*] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[78] Yale-educated presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).\n\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[79][*verification needed*] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders\", an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[79] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\"[77] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the *Yale Daily News*.[80] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\"[81] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family\".[82] *New York Times* correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and *The Atlantic Monthly* correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[83]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| School founding\n |\n| --- |\n| **School** | **Year founded** |\n| Yale College | 1701\n |\n| Yale School of Medicine | 1810\n |\n| Yale Divinity School | 1822\n |\n| Yale Law School | 1824\n |\n| Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Sheffield Scientific School[a] | 1847\n |\n| Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science | 1852\n |\n| Yale School of Fine Arts | 1869\n |\n| Yale School of Music | 1894\n |\n| Yale School of the Environment | 1900\n |\n| Yale School of Public Health | 1915\n |\n| Yale School of Architecture | 1916\n |\n| Yale School of Nursing | 1923\n |\n| David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University | 1955\n |\n| Yale School of Management | 1976\n |\n| Jackson School of Global Affairs | 2022[40] |\n\n\nThe President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[85] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[86]\n\n\nYale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of Duke University.[97] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n### Staff and labor unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees\n\nYale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[99] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[100][101] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[102] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[99][103] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[104] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[105] In October 2014, after deliberation,[106] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[99][107]\n\n\nYale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[108][*page needed*] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and *The New York Times* wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[109] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[110] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[111] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[112]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building ![](image)Interior of Beinecke Library\nYale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[113] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[114] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[115] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[116]\n\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\nMany of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[121][122] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[123] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall\n![](image)Vanderbilt Hall\nOther examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[124] Phelps Hall,[125] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[126]\n\n\nThe oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures.\n\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[127] Near the library is a sunken courtyard with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[128] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as \"Beinecke Plaza\".\n\n\nAlumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[129] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[130] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[131] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[132]\n\n\nThe athletic field complex is partially in New Haven, and partially in West Haven.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nYale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013\n\n### Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harkness Tower\nNotable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Humanities Quadrangle, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London.\n\n\nYale's secret society buildings (some of which are called \"tombs\") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King-lui Wu with Dan Kiley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nYale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[134] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n* Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven\n* Marsh Botanical Garden\n* Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm\n\n\n### Relationship with New Haven[edit]\n\n\nYale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[140] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however, has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[141] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Town–gown relations[edit]\n\n\nYale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in myriad community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nSeveral campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[144][145] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[146][147] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[148] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among peer schools.[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\nThrough its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and the university is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[157] Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[158] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[156][159][160] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[156] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140 scholars).[161]\n\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\nRare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Night Café*, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\n\nThe Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[164] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[165] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[166] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[167] | 4 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[168] | 11 |\n| *QS*[169] | 16 |\n| *THE*[170] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[171] | 11 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 7\n |\n| Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Law\n | 1\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 59\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 10\n |\n| Nursing: doctorate\n | 21\n |\n| Nursing: Master's\n | 20\n |\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 6\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 12\n |\n| Clinical Psychology\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 20\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 19\n |\n| Economics\n | 4\n |\n| English\n | 1\n |\n| Fine Arts\n | 2\n |\n| History\n | 2\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 12\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery\n | 2\n |\n| Physician Assistant\n | 26\n |\n| Physics\n | 11\n |\n| Political Science\n | 6\n |\n| Psychology\n | 6\n |\n| Public Health\n | 11\n |\n| Sociology\n | 18\n |\n| Statistics\n | 13\n |\n\n\nThe *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Yale third among U.S. national universities for 2016,[153] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years. Yale University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[173]\n\n\nInternationally, Yale was ranked 11th in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, tenth in the 2016–17 Nature Index[174] for quality of scientific research output, and tenth in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.[175] The university was also ranked sixth in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings[176] and eighth in the Academic World Reputation Rankings.[177] In 2019, it ranked 27th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[178]\n\n\n\n### Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(March 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nYale is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[179] According to the National Science Foundation, Yale spent $990 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 15th in the nation.[180]\n\n\nYale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15] The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League.[181] It also is a top 10 (ranked seventh) baccalaureate source (after normalization for the number of graduates) of some of the most notable scientists (Nobel, Fields, Turing prizes, or membership in National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, or National Academy of Medicine).[182]\n\n\nYale's English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The *Journal of Music Theory* was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.\n\n\nSince the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).\n\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\n\n## Campus life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 24%\n | 24 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Affluent[d] | 80%\n | 80 |\n\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[186] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct.\n\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[187]\n  \n\n\n\n\n* ![Jonathan Edwards College courtyard](image)\n\nJonathan Edwards College courtyard\n* ![Branford College courtyard](image)\n\nBranford College courtyard\n* ![Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard](image)\n\nSaybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard\n* ![Hopper College courtyard](image)\n\nHopper College courtyard\n* ![Berkeley College buildings](image)\n\nBerkeley College buildings\n* ![Trumbull College courtyard](image)\n\nTrumbull College courtyard\n* ![Davenport College courtyard](image)\n\nDavenport College courtyard\n* ![Pierson College courtyard](image)\n\nPierson College courtyard\n* ![Silliman College courtyard](image)\n\nSilliman College courtyard\n* ![Timothy Dwight College courtyard](image)\n\nTimothy Dwight College courtyard\n* ![Morse College courtyard](image)\n\nMorse College courtyard\n* ![Ezra Stiles College courtyard](image)\n\nEzra Stiles College courtyard\n* ![Benjamin Franklin College courtyard](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin College courtyard\n* ![Pauli Murray College courtyard](image)\n\nPauli Murray College courtyard\n\n\n#### Calhoun College[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"—he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina\".[191] He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\"[188] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[192] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[193] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[194]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests\", Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[195] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future\". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\nDespite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Hopper in February 2017.[197] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[198][199][200] In his 2019 book *Assault on American Excellence*, former Dean of Yale Law School Anthony T. Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\nThe university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The Yale Literary Magazine, founded in February 1836, is the oldest student literary magazine in the United States.[203] Established in 1872, *The Yale Record* is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the *Yale Daily News*, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly *Yale Herald*, which was first published in 1986. The *Yale Journal of Medicine & Law* is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.\n\n\nDwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.\n\n\nThe Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.\n\n\nThe Yale Political Union (YPU) is a debate society founded in 1934 to host student discussions on a wide variety of topics. It is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki.\n\n\nThe Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the university's top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN, YMUN Korea, YMUN Taiwan and Yale Model African Union (YMAU), and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS), Yale International Relations Leadership Institute, and Hemispheres.\n\n\nThe campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men.\n\n\nThe Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the \"Lizzie's\" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's *Paradise Lost*, among other important literary texts.\n\n\n\n#### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale secret societies\n\nYale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Brothers in Unity, Linonia, St. Anthony Hall, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Daughters of Sovereign Government (DSG), Mace and Chain, ISO, Spade and Grave, and Sage and Chalice, among others. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[207]\n\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale Bulldogs\n\n![](image)The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium\nYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.\n\n\nYale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural \"bowl\" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[214]\n\n\nIn 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale – against the wishes of the NCAA – playing its Jewish center Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster.[215][216][217][218] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.[219]\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220]\n\n![](image)The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex\nIn May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first-ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[221] and were the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[222]\n\n\nYale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race.\n\n\nIn 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[223]\n\n\nYale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[224][225]\n\n\nYale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. \"Precision\" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[226] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.\n\n\nYale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about 10 different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.\n\n\n\n#### Song[edit]\n\n\nNotable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, \"Bright College Years\". Despite its popularity, \"Boola Boola\" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, \"Bulldog\" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[227] Additionally, two other songs, \"Down the Field\" by C.W. O'Conner, and \"Bingo Eli Yale\", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to *College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology* published in 1998, \"Down the Field\" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe school mascot is \"Handsome Dan\", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, \"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow.\" The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[229] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[230]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nYale has faced significant criticism for its handling of student mental health on campus.[231][232][233][234] Suicidal and depressed students say that Yale forced them to medically withdraw rather than provide them with academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in 2018 the Ruderman Family Foundation ranked Yale as having the worst mental health policies in the Ivy League.[235][236][233]\n\n\n\n> \n> Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted. Love, Luchang.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nLuchang Wang, posted on Facebook in 2015 shortly before her death[231][234][237][238][239]\n\nStudents at Yale say that the university's policies force them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to leave.[231][235][234] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015, who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted.[237][234][239] Wang had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably more difficult for her.[237][234] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to her university therapist to avoid being kicked out,[237] and another student said that many at Yale lie to their counselors as \"there's no clear standard established that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for\".[234] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to \"reinstatement\" as well as eliminating the $50 reapplication fee.[231]\n\n\nFor students that do seek help, waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only 30 minutes in length.[231] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes.[232] In 2023, after a lawsuit was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination, the university changed the name of a \"medical withdrawal\" to a \"medical leave of absence\" saying that the \"leave of absence\" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's insurance while away from the school.[240] The new policy also allowed for students on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus,[240] something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing.[231] A representative of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies \"misrepresents our efforts and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success are our primary focus\" and that \"the mental health of our students is a very, very high priority\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Benefactors[edit]\n\n\nYale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale, Jeremiah Dummer, the Vanderbilt family, the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William), the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter), John William Sterling, Payne Whitney, Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, William K. Lanman, and Stephen Schwarzman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[241] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[242] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[243] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built, while a $150 million contribution[244] by David Geffen enabled the Yale School of Drama (renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale) to become tuition-free as well.\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yale University people, List of Yale Law School alumni, and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Yale University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

For example, Owen Johnson's novel *Stover at Yale* follows the college career of Dink Stover,[379] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[380][381] Yale University also is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel *The Great Gatsby*. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the *Yale News*, and Tom Buchanan was \"one of the most powerful ends that ever played football\" for Yale.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from Joseph E.

Established in 1754 as **King's College** on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, it is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States.\n\n\nColumbia was established as a colonial college by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\nColumbia scientists and scholars have played a pivotal role in scientific breakthroughs including brain-computer interface; the laser and maser;[13][14] nuclear magnetic resonance;[15] the first nuclear pile; the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas; the first evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift;[16][17][18] and much of the initial research and planning for the Manhattan Project during World War II.\n\n\nAs of December 2021[update], its alumni, faculty, and staff have included seven Founding Fathers of the United States;[n 2] four U.S. presidents;[n 3] 34 foreign heads of state;[n 4] two secretaries-general of the United Nations;[n 5] ten justices of the United States Supreme Court; 103 Nobel laureates; 125 National Academy of Sciences members;[60] 53 living billionaires;[61] 23 Olympic medalists;[62] 33 Academy Award winners; and 125 Pulitzer Prize recipients.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Columbia University\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Johnson, the first president of Columbia\nDiscussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.[63] However, it was not until the founding of the College of New Jersey (renamed Princeton) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.[63] In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[64]\n\n\nClasses were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Samuel Johnson.[65]: 8–10 Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.[66]: 3 The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of George II,[67][68] making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.[12]\n\n\nIn 1763, Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton.[66]: 3 The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy, was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.[69] The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King's College Hall, 1790\nAfter the Revolution, the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.[65]: 59 The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed \"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College\".[65] The Act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that \"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College\",[65] a reference to Columbia, an alternative name for America which in turn comes from the name of Christopher Columbus. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees.[72]: 65–70\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1797 Taylor Map of New York City, showing \"The College\" at its Park Place (then Robinson Street) location. Note earlier location, Trinity Church, lower left.\nOn May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected president of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[73] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams, in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[65]: 74\n\n\n\n### 19th century to present[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Student activism at Columbia University\n\n![](image)The Gothic Revival library and law school buildings on the Madison Avenue campus\n![](image)Low Memorial Library, c. 1900\n![](image)*Alma Mater*\nIn November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.[72]: 53–60 The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the president that Barnard College is named after, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. Barnard College was created in 1889 as a response to the university's refusal to accept women.[74] By this time, the college's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's expanding population.[66]: 5–8 In 1896, university president Seth Low moved the campus from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights.[65][75] Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \"multiversity\" model that later universities would adopt.[12] Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College, as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge.[63] Teachers College is currently affiliated as the university's Graduate School of Education.[76]\n\n\nResearch into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project.[77] In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.[63][78] The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.[79][80]\n\n\nThere was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II.[81] In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.[82] Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension.[83] While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.[84]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.[85] The Columbia University Bicentennial was celebrated in 1954.[86]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk, and the establishment of the University Senate.[87][88]\n\n\nThough several schools within the university had admitted women for years, Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983,[89] after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, the all-female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools.[90] Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[91]\n\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)Butler Library\nThe Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as \"South Hall\" by the university's former president Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, benefactor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College.[95] As of 2020[update], Columbia's library system includes over 15.0 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.[96]\n\n\nSeveral buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance. Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio.[97] Also listed is Pupin Hall, another National Historic Landmark, which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi. The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen, Denmark.[98][99] Other buildings listed include Casa Italiana, the Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building of St. Anthony Hall, Earl Hall, and the buildings of the affiliated Union Theological Seminary.[100][101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Union Theological Seminary\nA statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called *Alma Mater* is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a royal charter institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.[104] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.[105][106]\n\n\n\n\"The Steps\", alternatively known as \"Low Steps\" or the \"Urban Beach\", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th-century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.[107]\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Morningside Heights campus as seen from Butler Library and facing Low Memorial Library\n\n### Other campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lamont Campus entrance in Palisades, New York\n![](image)The entrance to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Washington Heights\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.[110][111] Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. As of December 2008[update], the State of New York's Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's \"blighted\" status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.[112] On May 20, 2009, the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.[113]\n\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University. According to *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"2020–21 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings\", it is ranked fourth overall and second among university hospitals.[114] Columbia's medical school has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute, and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals in other countries. Health-related schools are located at the Columbia University Medical Center, a 20-acre (8.1 ha) campus located in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.[115] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.[12]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles.[116] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.[117]\n\n\n\nEvery Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a greenmarket where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.[118] Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.[119] Columbia has been rated \"B+\" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[120]\n\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[121]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.[122]\n\n\nIn the New York City Subway, the ![\"1\" train](image) train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University. The M4, M104 and M60 buses stop on Broadway while the M11 stops on Amsterdam Avenue.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[123]Change vs.2016[124]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 3.9% (![Neutral decrease](image) −2.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 66.5% (![Increase](image) +1.4)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1510–1560 (![Decrease](image) −10 median)\n |\n|  |\n\n\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.[125] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.[126] In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).[127] The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.[128]\n\n\nAnnual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.[129] As of 2008[update], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.[130] In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.[131]\n\n\nScholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars \"distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences\".[132]\n\n\nIn 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by *The New York Times* as \"the first modern college application\". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.[133]\n\n\n\n### Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Graduate/Professional Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons | 1767\n |\n| College of Dental Medicine | 1852\n |\n| Columbia Law School | 1858\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1880\n |\n| Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation | 1881\n |\n| Teachers College, Columbia University (affiliate) | 1887\n |\n| Columbia University School of Nursing | 1892\n |\n| Columbia University School of Social Work | 1898\n |\n| Graduate School of Journalism | 1912\n |\n| Columbia Business School | 1916\n |\n| Mailman School of Public Health | 1922\n |\n| School of International and Public Affairs | 1946\n |\n| School of the Arts | 1965\n |\n| School of Professional Studies | 1995\n |\n| Columbia Climate School | 2021\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Undergraduate Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Columbia College | 1754\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Barnard College (affiliate) | 1889\n |\n| Columbia University School of General Studies | 1947\n |\n\n\nColumbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)Low Memorial Library\nThe University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve *ex officio*, and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.[136][137][138]\n\n\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.[135] Minouche Shafik became the 20th president of Columbia University on July 1, 2023. \n\n\n\n![](image)The Barnard College Class of 1913 processes down the steps of Low Library.\nColumbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College.[139][140] Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[141][142] Barnard students are also eligible to cross-register classes that are available through the Barnard Catalogue and alumnae can join the Columbia Alumni Association.[143]\n\n\nJoint degree programs are available through Union Theological Seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,[144] and the Juilliard School.[145][146] Teachers College and Barnard College are official faculties of the university; both colleges' presidents are deans under the university governance structure.[147] The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College and Barnard College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire university. Teachers College is an affiliated, financially independent graduate school with their own board of trustees.[137][138] Pursuant to an affiliation agreement, Columbia is given the authority to confer \"degrees and diplomas\" to the graduates of Teachers College. The degrees are signed by presidents of Teachers College and Columbia University in a manner analogous to the university's other graduate schools.[148][149][147] Columbia's General Studies school also has joint undergraduate programs available through University College London,[150] Sciences Po,[151] City University of Hong Kong,[152] Trinity College Dublin,[153] and the Juilliard School.[154]\n\n\nThe university also has several Columbia Global Centers, in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and Tunis.[155]\n\n\n\n### International partnerships[edit]\n\n\nColumbia students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as Sciences Po,[156] École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), École normale supérieure (ENS), Panthéon-Sorbonne University, King's College London, London School of Economics, University College London and the University of Warwick. Select students can study at either the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge for a year if approved by both Columbia and either Oxford or Cambridge.[157] Columbia also has a dual MA program with the Aga Khan University in London.\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[158] | 6 |\n| *Forbes*[159] | 5 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[160] | 12 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[161] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[162] | 5 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[163] | 8 |\n| *QS*[164] | 23 |\n| *THE*[165] | 11 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[166] | 7 |\n\n | \n\n| National Program Rankings[167] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Biological Sciences | 11\n |\n| Business | 8\n |\n| Chemistry | 12\n |\n| Computer Science | 11\n |\n| Earth Sciences | 5\n |\n| Economics | 9\n |\n| Engineering | 13\n |\n| English | 8\n |\n| Fine Arts | 10\n |\n| Health Care Management | 15\n |\n| History | 5\n |\n| Law | 4\n |\n| Mathematics | 7\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care | 75\n |\n| Medicine: Research | 3\n |\n| Nursing: Doctorate | 5\n |\n| Nursing: Master's | 6\n |\n| Nursing–Anesthesia | 22\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery | 13\n |\n| Occupational Therapy | 8\n |\n| Physical Therapy | 25\n |\n| Physics | 9\n |\n| Political Science | 8\n |\n| Psychology | 12\n |\n| Public Affairs | 23\n |\n| Public Health | 4\n |\n| Social Work | 5\n |\n| Sociology | 11\n |\n| Statistics | 5\n |\n\n | \n\n| Global Program Rankings[168] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Arts & Humanities | 18\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry | 20\n |\n| Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems | 3\n |\n| Chemistry | 33\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | 10\n |\n| Computer Science | 36\n |\n| Economics & Business | 8\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering | 102\n |\n| Engineering | 114\n |\n| Environment/Ecology | 36\n |\n| Geosciences | 4\n |\n| Immunology | 32\n |\n| Materials Science | 57\n |\n| Mathematics | 11\n |\n| Microbiology | 33\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics | 18\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior | 7\n |\n| Oncology | 32\n |\n| Pharmacology & Toxicology | 46\n |\n| Physics | 12\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science | 202\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology | 4\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health | 8\n |\n| Space Science | 37\n |\n| Surgery | 27\n |\n\n\n |\n\nColumbia University is ranked 12th in the United States and seventh globally for 2023–2024 by *U.S. News & World Report*. QS University Rankings listed Columbia as fifth in the United States. Ranked 15th among U.S. colleges for 2020 by *The Wall Street Journal* and *Times Higher Education*, in recent years it has been ranked as high as second. Individual colleges and schools were also nationally ranked by *U.S. News & World Report* for its 2021 edition. Columbia Law School was ranked fourth, the Mailman School of Public Health fourth, the School of Social Work tied for third, Columbia Business School eighth, the College of Physicians and Surgeons tied for sixth for research (and tied for 31st for primary care), the School of Nursing tied for 11th in the master's program and tied for first in the doctorate nursing program, and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (graduate) was ranked tied for 14th.\n\n\nIn 2021, Columbia was ranked seventh in the world (sixth in the United States) by *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, sixth in the world by *U.S. News & World Report*, 19th in the world by *QS World University Rankings*, and 11th globally by *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was ranked the second most admired graduate program by Architectural Record in 2020.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities ranked Columbia third best university for forming CEOs in the US and 12th worldwide.\n\n\n\n#### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Columbia's reporting of metrics used for university ranking was criticized by Professor of Mathematics Michael Thaddeus, who argued key data supporting the ranking was \"inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading.\"[169][170] Subsequently, *U.S. News & World Report* \"unranked\" Columbia from its 2022 list of Best Colleges saying that it could not verify the data submitted by the university.[171] In June 2023, Columbia University announced their undergraduate schools would no longer participate in *U.S. News & World Report's* rankings, following the lead of its law, medical and nursing schools. A press release cited concerns that such rankings unduly influence applicants and \"distill a university's profile into a composite of data categories.\"[172]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Havemeyer Hall, a National Historic Chemical Landmark, where deuterium was discovered in 1931. Research conducted in Havemeyer has led to at least seven Nobel Prizes.[173]\nColumbia is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[174] Columbia was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split. The College of Physicians and Surgeons played a central role in developing the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of *Principles of Neural Science*, described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the \"neuroscience 'bible' \".[175] The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser.[176] The first brain-computer interface capable of translating brain signals into speech was developed by neuroengineers at Columbia.[177][178][179] The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over limited bandwidth was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie was the first to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms.[180] Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for glass concrete, Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).[181]\n\n\nColumbia scientists have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year.[181] More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia reached the market. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy).[182] Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), as of 2008[update], manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements.[182] Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230 million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world.[183] Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.\n\n\n\n### Military and veteran enrollment[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is a long-standing participant of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Yellow Ribbon Program, allowing eligible veterans to pursue a Columbia undergraduate degree regardless of socioeconomic status for over 70 years.[184] As a part of the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) in partnership with the United States Military Academy at West Point, Columbia is the only school in the Ivy League to offer a graduate degree program in organizational psychology to aid military officers in tactical decision making and strategic management.[185]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Lee Bollinger presents the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction to Jeffrey Eugenides.\nSeveral prestigious awards are administered by Columbia University, most notably the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize in history.[186][187] Other prizes, which are awarded by the Graduate School of Journalism, include the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award, the National Magazine Awards, the Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the John Chancellor Award, and the Lukas Prizes, which include the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and Mark Lynton History Prize.[188] The university also administers the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, which is considered an important precursor to the Nobel Prize, 51 of its 101 recipients having gone on to win either a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Nobel Prize in Chemistry as of October 2018; the W. Alden Spencer Award; the Vetlesen Prize, which is known as the Nobel Prize of geology; the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature, the oldest such award; the Edwin Howard Armstrong award; the Calderone Prize in public health; and the Ditson Conductor's Award.[189][190][191][192][193][194][195]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[196] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 33%\n | 33 |\n| Foreign national | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Asian | 17%\n | 17 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[c] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nIn 2020, Columbia University's student population was 31,455 (8,842 students in undergraduate programs and 22,613 in postgraduate programs), with 45% of the student population identifying themselves as a minority.[197] Twenty-six percent of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000. 16% of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants,[198] which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Seventeen percent of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.[199]\n\n\nOn-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Carman Hall, Furnald Hall, Hartley Hall, John Jay Hall, or Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall). Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies, Barnard College and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.[200]\n\n\nColumbia University is home to many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10–15% of undergraduate students are associated with Greek life.[201] Many Barnard women also join Columbia sororities. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta chapter of Alpha Delta Phi.[202] The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations within each of the three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.[203]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Copies of the *Columbia Daily Spectator* being sold during the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike\n![](image)The Art Deco cover of the November 1931 edition of the *Jester*, celebrating the opening of the George Washington Bridge\nThe *Columbia Daily Spectator* is the nation's second-oldest continuously operating daily student newspaper.[204] *The Blue and White*[205] is a monthly literary magazine established in 1890 that discusses campus life and local politics. *Bwog*,[206] originally an offshoot of *The Blue and White* but now fully independent, is an online campus news and entertainment source. *The Morningside Post* is a student-run multimedia news publication.\n\n\nPolitical publications include *The Current*, a journal of politics, culture and Jewish Affairs;[207] the *Columbia Political Review*, the multi-partisan political magazine of the Columbia Political Union;[208] and *AdHoc*, which denotes itself as the \"progressive\" campus magazine and deals largely with local political issues and arts events.[209]\n\n\n*Columbia Magazine* is the alumni magazine of Columbia, serving all 340,000+ of the university's alumni. Arts and literary publications include *The Columbia Review*, the nation's oldest college literary magazine;[210] *Surgam*, the literary magazine of The Philolexian Society;[211] *Quarto*, Columbia University's official undergraduate literary magazine;[212] *4x4*, a student-run alternative to *Quarto*;[213] *Columbia*, a nationally regarded literary journal; the *Columbia Journal of Literary Criticism*;[214] and *The Mobius Strip*, an online arts and literary magazine.[215] *Inside New York* is an annual guidebook to New York City, written, edited, and published by Columbia undergraduates. Through a distribution agreement with Columbia University Press, the book is sold at major retailers and independent bookstores.[216]\n\n\nColumbia is home to numerous undergraduate academic publications. The *Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal* prints original science research in its two annual publications.[217] The *Journal of Politics & Society* is a journal of undergraduate research in the social sciences;[218] *Publius* is an undergraduate journal of politics established in 2008 and published biannually;[219] the *Columbia East Asia Review* allows undergraduates throughout the world to publish original work on China, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam and is supported by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute;[220] *The Birch* is an undergraduate journal of Eastern European and Eurasian culture that is the first national student-run journal of its kind;[221] the *Columbia Economics Review* is the undergraduate economic journal on research and policy supported by the Columbia Economics Department; and the *Columbia Science Review* is a science magazine that prints general interest articles and faculty profiles.[222]\n\n\nHumor publications on Columbia's campus include *The Fed*, a triweekly satire and investigative newspaper, and the *Jester of Columbia.[223]*[224] Other publications include *The Columbian*, the undergraduate colleges' annually published yearbook;[225] the *Gadfly*, a biannual journal of popular philosophy produced by undergraduates;[226] and *Rhapsody in Blue*, an undergraduate urban studies magazine.[227] Professional journals published by academic departments at Columbia University include *Current Musicology* and *The Journal of Philosophy*.[228][229] During the spring semester, graduate students in the Journalism School publish *The Bronx Beat*, a bi-weekly newspaper covering the South Bronx.\n\n\nFounded in 1961 under the auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the *Columbia Journalism Review* (CJR) examines day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance. The magazine is published six times a year.[230]\n\n\nFormer publications include the Columbia University Forum, a review of literature and cultural affairs distributed for free to alumni.[231][232]\n\n\n\n#### Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.[233] The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest student television station and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.[234][235]\n\n\n\n#### Debate and Model UN[edit]\n\n\nThe Philolexian Society is a literary and debating club founded in 1802, making it the oldest student group at Columbia, as well as the third oldest collegiate literary society in the country.[236] The society annually administers the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Bad Poetry Contest.[237] The Columbia Parliamentary Debate Team competes in tournaments around the country as part of the American Parliamentary Debate Association, and hosts both high school and college tournaments on Columbia's campus, as well as public debates on issues affecting the university.[238]\n\n\nThe Columbia International Relations Council and Association (CIRCA), oversees Columbia's Model United Nations activities. CIRCA hosts college and high school Model UN conferences, hosts speakers influential in international politics to speak on campus, and trains students from underprivileged schools in New York in Model UN.[239]\n\n\n\n### Technology and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pupin Hall, the physics building, showing the rooftop Rutherfurd Observatory\nColumbia is a top supplier of young engineering entrepreneurs for New York City. Over the past 20 years, graduates of Columbia established over 100 technology companies.[240]\n\n\nThe Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including talks, #StartupColumbia, a conference and venture competition for $250,000, and Ignite@CU, a weekend for undergrads interested in design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Notable speakers include Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey,[241] Alexis Ohanian, Drew Houston, and Mark Cuban. As of 2006, CORE had awarded graduate and undergraduate students over $100,000 in seed capital.\n\n\nCampusNetwork, an on-campus social networking site called Campus Network that preceded Facebook, was created and popularized by Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. Mark Zuckerberg later asked Goldberg to join him in Palo Alto to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer.[242] The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement. SEAS' entrepreneurship activities focus on community building initiatives in New York and worldwide, made possible through partners such as Microsoft Corporation.[243]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg launched the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is a consortium of Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford, and was established with a $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation.[244]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium\nMain article: Columbia Lions\n\nSee also: C-Rock\nA member institution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in Division I FCS, Columbia fields varsity teams in 29 sports and is a member of the Ivy League. The football Lions play home games at the 17,000-seat Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. The Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track, and rowing, as well as the new Campbell Sports Center, which opened in January 2013. The basketball, fencing, swimming & diving, volleyball, and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.[245]\n\n\n![](image)Major League Baseball Hall of Famer, Lou Gehrig\nFormer students include Baseball Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig and Eddie Collins, football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, Marcellus Wiley, and world champion women's weightlifter Karyn Marshall.[246][247] On May 17, 1939, fledgling NBC broadcast a doubleheader between the Columbia Lions and the Princeton Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field, making it the first televised regular athletic event in history.[248][249]\n\n\nColumbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against Rutgers University in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed Henley Royal Regatta in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student Maxie Long set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18–0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1–0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.[250] The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16–13 victory over arch-rival Princeton University. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old.[251] A new tradition has developed with the Liberty Cup. The Liberty Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, two of the only three NCAA Division I football teams in New York City.[252]\n\n\n\n### World Leaders Forum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)World Leaders Forum at Low Memorial Library\nEstablished in 2003 by university president Lee C. Bollinger, the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike to listen to world leaders in government, religion, industry, finance, and academia. The World Leaders Forum is a year-around event series that strives to provide a platform for uninhibited speech among nations and cultures, while educating students about problems and progress around the globe.[253]\n\n\nPast forum speakers include former president of the United States Bill Clinton, the prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former president of Ghana John Agyekum Kufuor, president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, prime minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, president of the Republic of Mozambique Joaquim Alberto Chissano, president of the Republic of Bolivia Carlos Diego Mesa Gisbert, president of the Republic of Romania Ion Iliescu, president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, the first female president of Finland Tarja Halonen, President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, President Pervez Musharraf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Iraq President Jalal Talabani, the 14th Dalai Lama, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, financier George Soros, Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg, President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and Al Gore.[254]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its role in serving as a venue for meetings and dances of the Columbia Queer Alliance.\nThe Columbia University Orchestra was founded by composer Edward MacDowell in 1896, and is the oldest continually operating university orchestra in the United States. Undergraduate student composers at Columbia may choose to become involved with Columbia New Music, which sponsors concerts of music written by undergraduate students from all of Columbia's schools.[255] The Notes and Keys, the oldest a cappella group at Columbia, was founded in 1909.[256] There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.[257]\n\n\nThe Columbia Queer Alliance is the central Columbia student organization that represents the bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, and questioning student population. It is the oldest gay student organization in the world, founded as the Student Homophile League in 1967 by students including lifelong activist Stephen Donaldson.[258][259]\n\n\nColumbia University campus military groups include the U.S. Military Veterans of Columbia University and Advocates for Columbia ROTC. In the 2005–06 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for \"students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton\".[260]\n\n\nThe largest student service organization at Columbia is Community Impact (CI). Founded in 1981, CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.[261]\n\n\nColumbia has several secret societies, including St. Anthony Hall, which was founded at the university in 1847, and two senior societies, the Nacoms and Sachems.[262][263]\n\n\n\n## Traditions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Columbia University traditions\n\n![](image)The program for *Fly With Me* (1920), one of the only collaborations between Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Lorenz Hart\n### The Varsity Show[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varsity Show\n\nThe Varsity Show is one of the oldest traditions at Columbia. Founded in 1893 as a fundraiser for the university's fledgling athletic teams, the Varsity Show now draws together the entire Columbia undergraduate community for a series of performances every April. Dedicated to producing a unique full-length musical that skewers and satirizes many dubious aspects of life at Columbia, the Varsity Show is written and performed exclusively by university undergraduates. Various renowned playwrights, composers, authors, directors, and actors have contributed to the Varsity Show, either as writers or performers, while students at Columbia, including Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, Lorenz Hart, Herman J. Mankiewicz, I. A. L. Diamond, Herman Wouk, Greta Gerwig, and Kate McKinnon.[264]\n\n\nNotable past shows include *Fly With Me* (1920), *The* *Streets of New York* (1948), *The Sky's the Limit* (1954), and *Angels at Columbia* (1994). In particular, *Streets of New York*, after having been revived three times, opened off-Broadway in 1963 and was awarded a 1964 Drama Desk Award. *The Mischief Maker* (1903), written by Edgar Allan Woolf and Cassius Freeborn, premiered at Madison Square Garden in 1906 as *Mam'zelle Champagne*.[264][265]\n\n\n\n### Tree Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTree Lighting at College Walk\n![](image)\nThe first modern Yule Log ceremony in John Jay Hall, 1910\n\nThe campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent Hall and Hamilton Hall on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sundial for free hot chocolate, performances by *a cappella* groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.[266]\n\n\nImmediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1910. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sundial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of *A Visit From St. Nicholas* by Clement Clarke Moore and *Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus* by Francis Pharcellus Church.[267]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Columbia University people\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Columbia University alumni and attendees; List of Columbia University people in politics, military and law; and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Columbia University as alumni or faculty\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Berle, Raymond Moley, and Rexford Tugwell, were law professors at Columbia.[344] The Statistical Research Group, which used statistics to analyze military problems during World War II, was composed of Columbia researchers and faculty including George Stigler and Milton Friedman.[345] Columbia faculty and researchers, including Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, George B. Pegram, Walter Zinn, Chien-Shiung Wu, Francis G. Slack, Harold Urey, Herbert L. Anderson, and Isidor Isaac Rabi, also played a significant role during the early phases of the Manhattan Project.[346]\n\n\nFollowing the rise of Nazi Germany, the exiled Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt would affiliate itself with Columbia from 1934 to 1950.[347] It was during this period that thinkers including Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse wrote and published some of the most seminal works of the Frankfurt School, including *Reason and Revolution*, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, and *Eclipse of Reason*.[348] Professors Edward Said, author of *Orientalism*, and Gayatri Spivak are generally considered as founders of the field of postcolonialism;[349][350] other professors that have significantly contributed to the field include Hamid Dabashi and Joseph Massad.[351][352] The works of professors Kimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia J. Williams, and Kendall Thomas were foundational to the field of critical race theory.[353]\n\n\nColumbia and its affiliated faculty have also made significant contributions to the study of religion. The affiliated Union Theological Seminary is a center of liberal Christianity in the United States, having served as the birthplace of Black theology through the efforts of faculty including James H. Cone and Cornel West,[354][355] and Womanist theology, through the works of Katie Cannon, Emilie Townes, and Delores S. Williams.[356][357][358] Likewise, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America was the birthplace of Conservative Judaism movement in the United States, which was founded and led by faculty members including Solomon Schechter, Alexander Kohut, and Louis Ginzberg in the early 20th century, and is a major center for Jewish studies in general.[359]\n\n\nOther schools of thought in the humanities Columbia professors made significant contributions toward include the Dunning School, founded by William Archibald Dunning;[360][361] the anthropological schools of historical particularism and cultural relativism, founded by Franz Boas;[362] and functional psychology, whose founders and proponents include John Dewey, James McKeen Cattell, Edward L. Thorndike, and Robert S. Woodworth.[363]\n\n\n\nNotable figures that have served as the president of Columbia University include 34th President of the United States Dwight D.

The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912. The change was formally accepted by the New York State Board of Regents in 1912.

Established in 1754 as **King's College** on the grounds of Trinity Church in Manhattan, it is the oldest institution of higher education in New York and the fifth-oldest in the United States.\n\n\nColumbia was established as a colonial college by royal charter under George II of Great Britain. It was renamed Columbia College in 1784 following the American Revolution, and in 1787 was placed under a private board of trustees headed by former students Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In 1896, the campus was moved to its current location in Morningside Heights and renamed Columbia University.\n\n\nColumbia is organized into twenty schools, including four undergraduate schools and 16 graduate schools. The university's research efforts include the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and accelerator laboratories with Big Tech firms such as Amazon and IBM.[10][11] Columbia is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and was the first school in the United States to grant the MD degree.[12] The university also annually administers the Pulitzer Prize. Its endowment stands at $13.3 billion as of 2022[update], which is among the largest of any academic institution.\n\n\nColumbia scientists and scholars have played a pivotal role in scientific breakthroughs including brain-computer interface; the laser and maser;[13][14] nuclear magnetic resonance;[15] the first nuclear pile; the first nuclear fission reaction in the Americas; the first evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift;[16][17][18] and much of the initial research and planning for the Manhattan Project during World War II.\n\n\nAs of December 2021[update], its alumni, faculty, and staff have included seven Founding Fathers of the United States;[n 2] four U.S. presidents;[n 3] 34 foreign heads of state;[n 4] two secretaries-general of the United Nations;[n 5] ten justices of the United States Supreme Court; 103 Nobel laureates; 125 National Academy of Sciences members;[60] 53 living billionaires;[61] 23 Olympic medalists;[62] 33 Academy Award winners; and 125 Pulitzer Prize recipients.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Columbia University\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Johnson, the first president of Columbia\nDiscussions regarding the founding of a college in the Province of New York began as early as 1704, at which time Colonel Lewis Morris wrote to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, the missionary arm of the Church of England, persuading the society that New York City was an ideal community in which to establish a college.[63] However, it was not until the founding of the College of New Jersey (renamed Princeton) across the Hudson River in New Jersey that the City of New York seriously considered founding a college.[63] In 1746, an act was passed by the general assembly of New York to raise funds for the foundation of a new college. In 1751, the assembly appointed a commission of ten New York residents, seven of whom were members of the Church of England, to direct the funds accrued by the state lottery towards the foundation of a college.[64]\n\n\nClasses were initially held in July 1754 and were presided over by the college's first president, Samuel Johnson.[65]: 8–10 Johnson was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan.[66]: 3 The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of George II,[67][68] making it the oldest institution of higher learning in the State of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.[12]\n\n\nIn 1763, Johnson was succeeded in the presidency by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate of the class of 1777, Alexander Hamilton.[66]: 3 The Irish anatomist, Samuel Clossy, was appointed professor of natural philosophy in October 1765 and later the college's first professor of anatomy in 1767.[69] The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 with the arrival of the Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King's College Hall, 1790\nAfter the Revolution, the college turned to the State of New York in order to restore its vitality, promising to make whatever changes to the school's charter the state might demand.[65]: 59 The legislature agreed to assist the college, and on May 1, 1784, it passed \"an Act for granting certain privileges to the College heretofore called King's College\".[65] The Act created a board of regents to oversee the resuscitation of King's College, and, in an effort to demonstrate its support for the new Republic, the legislature stipulated that \"the College within the City of New York heretofore called King's College be forever hereafter called and known by the name of Columbia College\",[65] a reference to Columbia, an alternative name for America which in turn comes from the name of Christopher Columbus. The Regents finally became aware of the college's defective constitution in February 1787 and appointed a revision committee, which was headed by John Jay and Alexander Hamilton. In April of that same year, a new charter was adopted for the college granted the power to a separate board of 24 trustees.[72]: 65–70\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1797 Taylor Map of New York City, showing \"The College\" at its Park Place (then Robinson Street) location. Note earlier location, Trinity Church, lower left.\nOn May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, the son of Samuel Johnson, was unanimously elected president of Columbia College. Prior to serving at the university, Johnson had participated in the First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.[73] For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. President George Washington and Vice President John Adams, in addition to both houses of Congress attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.[65]: 74\n\n\n\n### 19th century to present[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Student activism at Columbia University\n\n![](image)The Gothic Revival library and law school buildings on the Madison Avenue campus\n![](image)Low Memorial Library, c. 1900\n![](image)*Alma Mater*\nIn November 1813, the college agreed to incorporate its medical school with The College of Physicians and Surgeons, a new school created by the Regents of New York, forming Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.[72]: 53–60 The college's enrollment, structure, and academics stagnated for the majority of the 19th century, with many of the college presidents doing little to change the way that the college functioned. In 1857, the college moved from the King's College campus at Park Place to a primarily Gothic Revival campus on 49th Street and Madison Avenue, where it remained for the next forty years. During the last half of the 19th century, under the leadership of President F.A.P. Barnard, the president that Barnard College is named after, the institution rapidly assumed the shape of a modern university. Barnard College was created in 1889 as a response to the university's refusal to accept women.[74] By this time, the college's investments in New York real estate became a primary source of steady income for the school, mainly owing to the city's expanding population.[66]: 5–8 In 1896, university president Seth Low moved the campus from 49th Street to its present location, a more spacious campus in the developing neighborhood of Morningside Heights.[65][75] Under the leadership of Low's successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, who served for over four decades, Columbia rapidly became the nation's major institution for research, setting the \"multiversity\" model that later universities would adopt.[12] Prior to becoming the president of Columbia University, Butler founded Teachers College, as a school to prepare home economists and manual art teachers for the children of the poor, with philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge.[63] Teachers College is currently affiliated as the university's Graduate School of Education.[76]\n\n\nResearch into the atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's physics department in the international spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project.[77] In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College.[63][78] The college was closed in 1936 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently taught at Morningside Heights, although they did not belong to any college but to the university at large.[79][80]\n\n\nThere was an evening school called University Extension, which taught night classes, for a fee, to anyone willing to attend. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies in response to the return of GIs after World War II.[81] In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum.[82] Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of Continuing Education, and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension.[83] While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.[84]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the discipline of international relations became a major scholarly focus of the university, and in response, the School of International and Public Affairs was founded in 1946, drawing upon the resources of the faculties of political science, economics, and history.[85] The Columbia University Bicentennial was celebrated in 1954.[86]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s Columbia experienced large-scale student activism, which reached a climax in the spring of 1968 when hundreds of students occupied buildings on campus. The incident forced the resignation of Columbia's president, Grayson Kirk, and the establishment of the University Senate.[87][88]\n\n\nThough several schools within the university had admitted women for years, Columbia College first admitted women in the fall of 1983,[89] after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College, the all-female institution affiliated with the university, to merge the two schools.[90] Barnard College still remains affiliated with Columbia, and all Barnard graduates are issued diplomas signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[91]\n\n\nDuring the late 20th century, the university underwent significant academic, structural, and administrative changes as it developed into a major research university. For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)College Walk\nThe majority of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in the Upper Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century vision of a university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts planning principles by the architects McKim, Mead & White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or 32 acres (13 ha), in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights. Columbia University has an extensive tunnel system, more than a century old, with the oldest portions predating the present campus. Some of these remain accessible to the public, while others have been cordoned off.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)Butler Library\nThe Nicholas Murray Butler Library, known simply as Butler Library, is the largest single library in the Columbia University Library System, and is one of the largest buildings on the campus. Proposed as \"South Hall\" by the university's former president Nicholas Murray Butler as expansion plans for Low Memorial Library stalled, the new library was funded by Edward Harkness, benefactor of Yale's residential college system, and designed by his favorite architect, James Gamble Rogers. It was completed in 1934 and renamed for Butler in 1946. The library design is neo-classical in style. Its facade features a row of columns in the Ionic order above which are inscribed the names of great writers, philosophers, and thinkers, most of whom are read by students engaged in the Core Curriculum of Columbia College.[95] As of 2020[update], Columbia's library system includes over 15.0 million volumes, making it the eighth largest library system and fifth largest collegiate library system in the United States.[96]\n\n\nSeveral buildings on the Morningside Heights campus are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Low Memorial Library, a National Historic Landmark and the centerpiece of the campus, is listed for its architectural significance. Philosophy Hall is listed as the site of the invention of FM radio.[97] Also listed is Pupin Hall, another National Historic Landmark, which houses the physics and astronomy departments. Here the first experiments on the fission of uranium were conducted by Enrico Fermi. The uranium atom was split there ten days after the world's first atom-splitting in Copenhagen, Denmark.[98][99] Other buildings listed include Casa Italiana, the Delta Psi, Alpha Chapter building of St. Anthony Hall, Earl Hall, and the buildings of the affiliated Union Theological Seminary.[100][101][102][103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Union Theological Seminary\nA statue by sculptor Daniel Chester French called *Alma Mater* is centered on the front steps of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library in the center of the campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a royal charter institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired.[104] The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.[105][106]\n\n\n\n\"The Steps\", alternatively known as \"Low Steps\" or the \"Urban Beach\", are a popular meeting area for Columbia students. The term refers to the long series of granite steps leading from the lower part of campus (South Field) to its upper terrace. With a design inspired by the City Beautiful movement, the steps of Low Library provides Columbia University and Barnard College students, faculty, and staff with a comfortable outdoor platform and space for informal gatherings, events, and ceremonies. McKim's classical facade epitomizes late 19th-century new-classical designs, with its columns and portico marking the entrance to an important structure.[107]\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Morningside Heights campus as seen from Butler Library and facing Low Memorial Library\n\n### Other campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lamont Campus entrance in Palisades, New York\n![](image)The entrance to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Washington Heights\nIn April 2007, the university purchased more than two-thirds of a 17 acres (6.9 ha) site for a new campus in Manhattanville, an industrial neighborhood to the north of the Morningside Heights campus. Stretching from 125th Street to 133rd Street, Columbia Manhattanville houses buildings for Columbia's Business School, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia School of the Arts, and the Jerome L. Greene Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior, where research will occur on neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.[108][109] The $7 billion expansion plan included demolishing all buildings, except three that are historically significant (the Studebaker Building, Prentis Hall, and the Nash Building), eliminating the existing light industry and storage warehouses, and relocating tenants in 132 apartments. Replacing these buildings created 6.8 million square feet (630,000 m2) of space for the university. Community activist groups in West Harlem fought the expansion for reasons ranging from property protection and fair exchange for land, to residents' rights.[110][111] Subsequent public hearings drew neighborhood opposition. As of December 2008[update], the State of New York's Empire State Development Corporation approved use of eminent domain, which, through declaration of Manhattanville's \"blighted\" status, gives governmental bodies the right to appropriate private property for public use.[112] On May 20, 2009, the New York State Public Authorities Control Board approved the Manhanttanville expansion plan.[113]\n\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian Hospital is affiliated with the medical schools of both Columbia University and Cornell University. According to *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"2020–21 Best Hospitals Honor Roll and Medical Specialties Rankings\", it is ranked fourth overall and second among university hospitals.[114] Columbia's medical school has a strategic partnership with New York State Psychiatric Institute, and is affiliated with 19 other hospitals in the U.S. and four hospitals in other countries. Health-related schools are located at the Columbia University Medical Center, a 20-acre (8.1 ha) campus located in the neighborhood of Washington Heights, fifty blocks uptown. Other teaching hospitals affiliated with Columbia through the NewYork-Presbyterian network include the Payne Whitney Clinic in Manhattan, and the Payne Whitney Westchester, a psychiatric institute located in White Plains, New York.[115] On the northern tip of Manhattan island (in the neighborhood of Inwood), Columbia owns the 26-acre (11 ha) Baker Field, which includes the Lawrence A. Wien Stadium as well as facilities for field sports, outdoor track, and tennis. There is a third campus on the west bank of the Hudson River, the 157-acre (64 ha) Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory and Earth Institute in Palisades, New York. A fourth is the 60-acre (24 ha) Nevis Laboratories in Irvington, New York, for the study of particle and motion physics. A satellite site in Paris holds classes at Reid Hall.[12]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, the university established the Office of Environmental Stewardship to initiate, coordinate and implement programs to reduce the university's environmental footprint. The U.S. Green Building Council selected the university's Manhattanville plan for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Neighborhood Design pilot program. The plan commits to incorporating smart growth, new urbanism and \"green\" building design principles.[116] Columbia is one of the 2030 Challenge Partners, a group of nine universities in the city of New York that have pledged to reduce their greenhouse emissions by 30% within the next ten years. Columbia University adopts LEED standards for all new construction and major renovations. The university requires a minimum of Silver, but through its design and review process seeks to achieve higher levels. This is especially challenging for lab and research buildings with their intensive energy use; however, the university also uses lab design guidelines that seek to maximize energy efficiency while protecting the safety of researchers.[117]\n\n\n\nEvery Thursday and Sunday of the month, Columbia hosts a greenmarket where local farmers can sell their produce to residents of the city. In addition, from April to November Hodgson's farm, a local New York gardening center, joins the market bringing a large selection of plants and blooming flowers. The market is one of the many operated at different points throughout the city by the non-profit group GrowNYC.[118] Dining services at Columbia spends 36 percent of its food budget on local products, in addition to serving sustainably harvested seafood and fair trade coffee on campus.[119] Columbia has been rated \"B+\" by the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card for its environmental and sustainability initiatives.[120]\n\n![](image)Access to Columbia is enhanced by the 116th Street–Columbia University subway station (1 train) on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line.\nAccording to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Columbia University would have a dominant vegetation type of Appalachian Oak (*104*) with a dominant vegetation form of Eastern Hardwood Forest (*25*).[121]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nColumbia Transportation is the bus service of the university, operated by Academy Bus Lines. The buses are open to all Columbia faculty, students, Dodge Fitness Center members, and anyone else who holds a Columbia ID card. In addition, all TSC students can ride the buses.[122]\n\n\nIn the New York City Subway, the ![\"1\" train](image) train serves the university at 116th Street-Columbia University. The M4, M104 and M60 buses stop on Broadway while the M11 stops on Amsterdam Avenue.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Van Amringe Quadrangle and Memorial\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2021 enteringclass[123]Change vs.2016[124]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 3.9% (![Neutral decrease](image) −2.1)\n |\n| Yield rate | 66.5% (![Increase](image) +1.4)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT Total | 1510–1560 (![Decrease](image) −10 median)\n |\n|  |\n\n\nColumbia University received 60,551 applications for the class of 2025 (entering 2021) and a total of around 2,218 were admitted to the two schools for an overall acceptance rate of 3.66%.[125] Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516.[126] In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).[127] The college is need-blind for domestic applicants.[128]\n\n\nAnnual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. On April 11, 2007, Columbia University announced a $400 million donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge to be used exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education.[129] As of 2008[update], undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a year will have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and then-current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies.[130] In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.[131]\n\n\nScholarships are also given to undergraduate students by the admissions committee. Designations include John W. Kluge Scholars, John Jay Scholars, C. Prescott Davis Scholars, Global Scholars, Egleston Scholars, and Science Research Fellows. Named scholars are selected by the admission committee from first-year applicants. According to Columbia, the first four designated scholars \"distinguish themselves for their remarkable academic and personal achievements, dynamism, intellectual curiosity, the originality and independence of their thinking, and the diversity that stems from their different cultures and their varied educational experiences\".[132]\n\n\nIn 1919, Columbia established a student application process characterized by *The New York Times* as \"the first modern college application\". The application required a photograph of the applicant, the maiden name of the applicant's mother, and the applicant's religious background.[133]\n\n\n\n### Organization[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Graduate/Professional Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons | 1767\n |\n| College of Dental Medicine | 1852\n |\n| Columbia Law School | 1858\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1880\n |\n| Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation | 1881\n |\n| Teachers College, Columbia University (affiliate) | 1887\n |\n| Columbia University School of Nursing | 1892\n |\n| Columbia University School of Social Work | 1898\n |\n| Graduate School of Journalism | 1912\n |\n| Columbia Business School | 1916\n |\n| Mailman School of Public Health | 1922\n |\n| School of International and Public Affairs | 1946\n |\n| School of the Arts | 1965\n |\n| School of Professional Studies | 1995\n |\n| Columbia Climate School | 2021\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Columbia Undergraduate Schools[134] |\n| --- |\n| **College/school** | **Year founded** |\n| Columbia College | 1754\n |\n| Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1864\n |\n| Barnard College (affiliate) | 1889\n |\n| Columbia University School of General Studies | 1947\n |\n\n\nColumbia University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The trustees appoint the president and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)Low Memorial Library\nThe University Senate was established by the trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the provost, the deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all of whom serve *ex officio*, and five additional representatives, appointed by the president, from the university's administration. The president serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.[136][137][138]\n\n\nThe president of Columbia University, who is selected by the trustees in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate and who serves at the trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the president in administering the university are the provost, the senior executive vice president, the executive vice president for health and biomedical sciences, several other vice presidents, the general counsel, the secretary of the university, and the deans of the faculties, all of whom are appointed by the trustees on the nomination of the president and serve at their pleasure.[135] Minouche Shafik became the 20th president of Columbia University on July 1, 2023. \n\n\n\n![](image)The Barnard College Class of 1913 processes down the steps of Low Library.\nColumbia has four official undergraduate colleges: Columbia College, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree; the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering), the engineering and applied science school offering the Bachelor of Science degree; the School of General Studies, the liberal arts college offering the Bachelor of Arts degree to non-traditional students undertaking full- or part-time study; and Barnard College.[139][140] Barnard College is a women's liberal arts college and an academic affiliate in which students receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University. Their degrees are signed by the presidents of Columbia University and Barnard College.[141][142] Barnard students are also eligible to cross-register classes that are available through the Barnard Catalogue and alumnae can join the Columbia Alumni Association.[143]\n\n\nJoint degree programs are available through Union Theological Seminary, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,[144] and the Juilliard School.[145][146] Teachers College and Barnard College are official faculties of the university; both colleges' presidents are deans under the university governance structure.[147] The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College and Barnard College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire university. Teachers College is an affiliated, financially independent graduate school with their own board of trustees.[137][138] Pursuant to an affiliation agreement, Columbia is given the authority to confer \"degrees and diplomas\" to the graduates of Teachers College. The degrees are signed by presidents of Teachers College and Columbia University in a manner analogous to the university's other graduate schools.[148][149][147] Columbia's General Studies school also has joint undergraduate programs available through University College London,[150] Sciences Po,[151] City University of Hong Kong,[152] Trinity College Dublin,[153] and the Juilliard School.[154]\n\n\nThe university also has several Columbia Global Centers, in Amman, Beijing, Istanbul, Mumbai, Nairobi, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, and Tunis.[155]\n\n\n\n### International partnerships[edit]\n\n\nColumbia students can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions such as Sciences Po,[156] École des hautes études en sciences sociales (EHESS), École normale supérieure (ENS), Panthéon-Sorbonne University, King's College London, London School of Economics, University College London and the University of Warwick. Select students can study at either the University of Oxford or the University of Cambridge for a year if approved by both Columbia and either Oxford or Cambridge.[157] Columbia also has a dual MA program with the Aga Khan University in London.\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[158] | 6 |\n| *Forbes*[159] | 5 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[160] | 12 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[161] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[162] | 5 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[163] | 8 |\n| *QS*[164] | 23 |\n| *THE*[165] | 11 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[166] | 7 |\n\n | \n\n| National Program Rankings[167] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Biological Sciences | 11\n |\n| Business | 8\n |\n| Chemistry | 12\n |\n| Computer Science | 11\n |\n| Earth Sciences | 5\n |\n| Economics | 9\n |\n| Engineering | 13\n |\n| English | 8\n |\n| Fine Arts | 10\n |\n| Health Care Management | 15\n |\n| History | 5\n |\n| Law | 4\n |\n| Mathematics | 7\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care | 75\n |\n| Medicine: Research | 3\n |\n| Nursing: Doctorate | 5\n |\n| Nursing: Master's | 6\n |\n| Nursing–Anesthesia | 22\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery | 13\n |\n| Occupational Therapy | 8\n |\n| Physical Therapy | 25\n |\n| Physics | 9\n |\n| Political Science | 8\n |\n| Psychology | 12\n |\n| Public Affairs | 23\n |\n| Public Health | 4\n |\n| Social Work | 5\n |\n| Sociology | 11\n |\n| Statistics | 5\n |\n\n | \n\n| Global Program Rankings[168] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Arts & Humanities | 18\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry | 20\n |\n| Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems | 3\n |\n| Chemistry | 33\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | 10\n |\n| Computer Science | 36\n |\n| Economics & Business | 8\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering | 102\n |\n| Engineering | 114\n |\n| Environment/Ecology | 36\n |\n| Geosciences | 4\n |\n| Immunology | 32\n |\n| Materials Science | 57\n |\n| Mathematics | 11\n |\n| Microbiology | 33\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics | 18\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior | 7\n |\n| Oncology | 32\n |\n| Pharmacology & Toxicology | 46\n |\n| Physics | 12\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science | 202\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology | 4\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health | 8\n |\n| Space Science | 37\n |\n| Surgery | 27\n |\n\n\n |\n\nColumbia University is ranked 12th in the United States and seventh globally for 2023–2024 by *U.S. News & World Report*. QS University Rankings listed Columbia as fifth in the United States. Ranked 15th among U.S. colleges for 2020 by *The Wall Street Journal* and *Times Higher Education*, in recent years it has been ranked as high as second. Individual colleges and schools were also nationally ranked by *U.S. News & World Report* for its 2021 edition. Columbia Law School was ranked fourth, the Mailman School of Public Health fourth, the School of Social Work tied for third, Columbia Business School eighth, the College of Physicians and Surgeons tied for sixth for research (and tied for 31st for primary care), the School of Nursing tied for 11th in the master's program and tied for first in the doctorate nursing program, and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (graduate) was ranked tied for 14th.\n\n\nIn 2021, Columbia was ranked seventh in the world (sixth in the United States) by *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, sixth in the world by *U.S. News & World Report*, 19th in the world by *QS World University Rankings*, and 11th globally by *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance. Columbia's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation was ranked the second most admired graduate program by Architectural Record in 2020.\n\n\nIn 2011, the Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities ranked Columbia third best university for forming CEOs in the US and 12th worldwide.\n\n\n\n#### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Columbia's reporting of metrics used for university ranking was criticized by Professor of Mathematics Michael Thaddeus, who argued key data supporting the ranking was \"inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading.\"[169][170] Subsequently, *U.S. News & World Report* \"unranked\" Columbia from its 2022 list of Best Colleges saying that it could not verify the data submitted by the university.[171] In June 2023, Columbia University announced their undergraduate schools would no longer participate in *U.S. News & World Report's* rankings, following the lead of its law, medical and nursing schools. A press release cited concerns that such rankings unduly influence applicants and \"distill a university's profile into a composite of data categories.\"[172]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Havemeyer Hall, a National Historic Chemical Landmark, where deuterium was discovered in 1931. Research conducted in Havemeyer has led to at least seven Nobel Prizes.[173]\nColumbia is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\".[174] Columbia was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split. The College of Physicians and Surgeons played a central role in developing the modern understanding of neuroscience with the publication of *Principles of Neural Science*, described by historian of science Katja Huenther as the \"neuroscience 'bible' \".[175] The book was written by a team of Columbia researchers that included Nobel Prize winner Eric Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas Jessell. Columbia was the birthplace of FM radio and the laser.[176] The first brain-computer interface capable of translating brain signals into speech was developed by neuroengineers at Columbia.[177][178][179] The MPEG-2 algorithm of transmitting high quality audio and video over limited bandwidth was developed by Dimitris Anastassiou, a Columbia professor of electrical engineering. Biologist Martin Chalfie was the first to introduce the use of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) in labeling cells in intact organisms.[180] Other inventions and products related to Columbia include Sequential Lateral Solidification (SLS) technology for making LCDs, System Management Arts (SMARTS), Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) (which is used for audio, video, chat, instant messaging and whiteboarding), pharmacopeia, Macromodel (software for computational chemistry), a new and better recipe for glass concrete, Blue LEDs, and Beamprop (used in photonics).[181]\n\n\nColumbia scientists have been credited with about 175 new inventions in the health sciences each year.[181] More than 30 pharmaceutical products based on discoveries and inventions made at Columbia reached the market. These include Remicade (for arthritis), Reopro (for blood clot complications), Xalatan (for glaucoma), Benefix, Latanoprost (a glaucoma treatment), shoulder prosthesis, homocysteine (testing for cardiovascular disease), and Zolinza (for cancer therapy).[182] Columbia Technology Ventures (formerly Science and Technology Ventures), as of 2008[update], manages some 600 patents and more than 250 active license agreements.[182] Patent-related deals earned Columbia more than $230 million in the 2006 fiscal year, according to the university, more than any university in the world.[183] Columbia owns many unique research facilities, such as the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information dedicated to telecommunications and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is an astronomical observatory affiliated with NASA.\n\n\n\n### Military and veteran enrollment[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is a long-standing participant of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Yellow Ribbon Program, allowing eligible veterans to pursue a Columbia undergraduate degree regardless of socioeconomic status for over 70 years.[184] As a part of the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) in partnership with the United States Military Academy at West Point, Columbia is the only school in the Ivy League to offer a graduate degree program in organizational psychology to aid military officers in tactical decision making and strategic management.[185]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Lee Bollinger presents the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction to Jeffrey Eugenides.\nSeveral prestigious awards are administered by Columbia University, most notably the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize in history.[186][187] Other prizes, which are awarded by the Graduate School of Journalism, include the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award, the National Magazine Awards, the Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the John Chancellor Award, and the Lukas Prizes, which include the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize and Mark Lynton History Prize.[188] The university also administers the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize, which is considered an important precursor to the Nobel Prize, 51 of its 101 recipients having gone on to win either a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine or Nobel Prize in Chemistry as of October 2018; the W. Alden Spencer Award; the Vetlesen Prize, which is known as the Nobel Prize of geology; the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Prize for the Translation of Japanese Literature, the oldest such award; the Edwin Howard Armstrong award; the Calderone Prize in public health; and the Ditson Conductor's Award.[189][190][191][192][193][194][195]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[196] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 33%\n | 33 |\n| Foreign national | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Asian | 17%\n | 17 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Other[a] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[c] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nIn 2020, Columbia University's student population was 31,455 (8,842 students in undergraduate programs and 22,613 in postgraduate programs), with 45% of the student population identifying themselves as a minority.[197] Twenty-six percent of students at Columbia have family incomes below $60,000. 16% of students at Columbia receive Federal Pell Grants,[198] which mostly go to students whose family incomes are below $40,000. Seventeen percent of students are the first member of their family to attend a four-year college.[199]\n\n\nOn-campus housing is guaranteed for all four years as an undergraduate. Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) share housing in the on-campus residence halls. First-year students usually live in one of the large residence halls situated around South Lawn: Carman Hall, Furnald Hall, Hartley Hall, John Jay Hall, or Wallach Hall (originally Livingston Hall). Upperclassmen participate in a room selection process, wherein students can pick to live in a mix of either corridor- or apartment-style housing with their friends. The Columbia University School of General Studies, Barnard College and graduate schools have their own apartment-style housing in the surrounding neighborhood.[200]\n\n\nColumbia University is home to many fraternities, sororities, and co-educational Greek organizations. Approximately 10–15% of undergraduate students are associated with Greek life.[201] Many Barnard women also join Columbia sororities. There has been a Greek presence on campus since the establishment in 1836 of the Delta chapter of Alpha Delta Phi.[202] The InterGreek Council is the self-governing student organization that provides guidelines and support to its member organizations within each of the three councils at Columbia, the Interfraternity Council, Panhellenic Council, and Multicultural Greek Council. The three council presidents bring their affiliated chapters together once a month to meet as one Greek community. The InterGreek Council meetings provide opportunity for member organizations to learn from each other, work together and advocate for community needs.[203]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Copies of the *Columbia Daily Spectator* being sold during the 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike\n![](image)The Art Deco cover of the November 1931 edition of the *Jester*, celebrating the opening of the George Washington Bridge\nThe *Columbia Daily Spectator* is the nation's second-oldest continuously operating daily student newspaper.[204] *The Blue and White*[205] is a monthly literary magazine established in 1890 that discusses campus life and local politics. *Bwog*,[206] originally an offshoot of *The Blue and White* but now fully independent, is an online campus news and entertainment source. *The Morningside Post* is a student-run multimedia news publication.\n\n\nPolitical publications include *The Current*, a journal of politics, culture and Jewish Affairs;[207] the *Columbia Political Review*, the multi-partisan political magazine of the Columbia Political Union;[208] and *AdHoc*, which denotes itself as the \"progressive\" campus magazine and deals largely with local political issues and arts events.[209]\n\n\n*Columbia Magazine* is the alumni magazine of Columbia, serving all 340,000+ of the university's alumni. Arts and literary publications include *The Columbia Review*, the nation's oldest college literary magazine;[210] *Surgam*, the literary magazine of The Philolexian Society;[211] *Quarto*, Columbia University's official undergraduate literary magazine;[212] *4x4*, a student-run alternative to *Quarto*;[213] *Columbia*, a nationally regarded literary journal; the *Columbia Journal of Literary Criticism*;[214] and *The Mobius Strip*, an online arts and literary magazine.[215] *Inside New York* is an annual guidebook to New York City, written, edited, and published by Columbia undergraduates. Through a distribution agreement with Columbia University Press, the book is sold at major retailers and independent bookstores.[216]\n\n\nColumbia is home to numerous undergraduate academic publications. The *Columbia Undergraduate Science Journal* prints original science research in its two annual publications.[217] The *Journal of Politics & Society* is a journal of undergraduate research in the social sciences;[218] *Publius* is an undergraduate journal of politics established in 2008 and published biannually;[219] the *Columbia East Asia Review* allows undergraduates throughout the world to publish original work on China, Japan, Korea, Tibet, and Vietnam and is supported by the Weatherhead East Asian Institute;[220] *The Birch* is an undergraduate journal of Eastern European and Eurasian culture that is the first national student-run journal of its kind;[221] the *Columbia Economics Review* is the undergraduate economic journal on research and policy supported by the Columbia Economics Department; and the *Columbia Science Review* is a science magazine that prints general interest articles and faculty profiles.[222]\n\n\nHumor publications on Columbia's campus include *The Fed*, a triweekly satire and investigative newspaper, and the *Jester of Columbia.[223]*[224] Other publications include *The Columbian*, the undergraduate colleges' annually published yearbook;[225] the *Gadfly*, a biannual journal of popular philosophy produced by undergraduates;[226] and *Rhapsody in Blue*, an undergraduate urban studies magazine.[227] Professional journals published by academic departments at Columbia University include *Current Musicology* and *The Journal of Philosophy*.[228][229] During the spring semester, graduate students in the Journalism School publish *The Bronx Beat*, a bi-weekly newspaper covering the South Bronx.\n\n\nFounded in 1961 under the auspices of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, the *Columbia Journalism Review* (CJR) examines day-to-day press performance as well as the forces that affect that performance. The magazine is published six times a year.[230]\n\n\nFormer publications include the Columbia University Forum, a review of literature and cultural affairs distributed for free to alumni.[231][232]\n\n\n\n#### Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nColumbia is home to two pioneers in undergraduate campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. Many undergraduates are also involved with Barnard's radio station, WBAR. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-state area, claims to be the oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR was not a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room.[233] The station has its studios on the second floor of Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest student television station and the home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.[234][235]\n\n\n\n#### Debate and Model UN[edit]\n\n\nThe Philolexian Society is a literary and debating club founded in 1802, making it the oldest student group at Columbia, as well as the third oldest collegiate literary society in the country.[236] The society annually administers the Joyce Kilmer Memorial Bad Poetry Contest.[237] The Columbia Parliamentary Debate Team competes in tournaments around the country as part of the American Parliamentary Debate Association, and hosts both high school and college tournaments on Columbia's campus, as well as public debates on issues affecting the university.[238]\n\n\nThe Columbia International Relations Council and Association (CIRCA), oversees Columbia's Model United Nations activities. CIRCA hosts college and high school Model UN conferences, hosts speakers influential in international politics to speak on campus, and trains students from underprivileged schools in New York in Model UN.[239]\n\n\n\n### Technology and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pupin Hall, the physics building, showing the rooftop Rutherfurd Observatory\nColumbia is a top supplier of young engineering entrepreneurs for New York City. Over the past 20 years, graduates of Columbia established over 100 technology companies.[240]\n\n\nThe Columbia University Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) was founded in 1999. The student-run group aims to foster entrepreneurship on campus. Each year CORE hosts dozens of events, including talks, #StartupColumbia, a conference and venture competition for $250,000, and Ignite@CU, a weekend for undergrads interested in design, engineering, and entrepreneurship. Notable speakers include Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey,[241] Alexis Ohanian, Drew Houston, and Mark Cuban. As of 2006, CORE had awarded graduate and undergraduate students over $100,000 in seed capital.\n\n\nCampusNetwork, an on-campus social networking site called Campus Network that preceded Facebook, was created and popularized by Columbia engineering student Adam Goldberg in 2003. Mark Zuckerberg later asked Goldberg to join him in Palo Alto to work on Facebook, but Goldberg declined the offer.[242] The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science offers a minor in Technical Entrepreneurship through its Center for Technology, Innovation, and Community Engagement. SEAS' entrepreneurship activities focus on community building initiatives in New York and worldwide, made possible through partners such as Microsoft Corporation.[243]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg launched the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is a consortium of Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar ones at MIT and Stanford, and was established with a $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation.[244]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium\nMain article: Columbia Lions\n\nSee also: C-Rock\nA member institution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in Division I FCS, Columbia fields varsity teams in 29 sports and is a member of the Ivy League. The football Lions play home games at the 17,000-seat Robert K. Kraft Field at Lawrence A. Wien Stadium. The Baker Athletics Complex also includes facilities for baseball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, tennis, track, and rowing, as well as the new Campbell Sports Center, which opened in January 2013. The basketball, fencing, swimming & diving, volleyball, and wrestling programs are based at the Dodge Physical Fitness Center on the main campus.[245]\n\n\n![](image)Major League Baseball Hall of Famer, Lou Gehrig\nFormer students include Baseball Hall of Famers Lou Gehrig and Eddie Collins, football Hall of Famer Sid Luckman, Marcellus Wiley, and world champion women's weightlifter Karyn Marshall.[246][247] On May 17, 1939, fledgling NBC broadcast a doubleheader between the Columbia Lions and the Princeton Tigers at Columbia's Baker Field, making it the first televised regular athletic event in history.[248][249]\n\n\nColumbia University athletics has a long history, with many accomplishments in athletic fields. In 1870, Columbia played against Rutgers University in the second intercollegiate rugby football game in the history of the sport. Eight years later, Columbia crew won the famed Henley Royal Regatta in the first-ever defeat for an English crew rowing in English waters. In 1900, Olympian and Columbia College student Maxie Long set the first official world record in the 400 meters with a time of 47.8 seconds. In 1983, Columbia men's soccer went 18–0 and was ranked first in the nation, but lost to Indiana 1–0 in double overtime in the NCAA championship game; nevertheless, the team went further toward the NCAA title than any Ivy League soccer team in history.[250] The football program unfortunately is best known for its record of futility set during the 1980s: between 1983 and 1988, the team lost 44 games in a row, which is still the record for the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. The streak was broken on October 8, 1988, with a 16–13 victory over arch-rival Princeton University. That was the Lions' first victory at Wien Stadium, which had been opened during the losing streak and was already four years old.[251] A new tradition has developed with the Liberty Cup. The Liberty Cup is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, two of the only three NCAA Division I football teams in New York City.[252]\n\n\n\n### World Leaders Forum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)World Leaders Forum at Low Memorial Library\nEstablished in 2003 by university president Lee C. Bollinger, the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University provides the opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike to listen to world leaders in government, religion, industry, finance, and academia. The World Leaders Forum is a year-around event series that strives to provide a platform for uninhibited speech among nations and cultures, while educating students about problems and progress around the globe.[253]\n\n\nPast forum speakers include former president of the United States Bill Clinton, the prime minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former president of Ghana John Agyekum Kufuor, president of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai, prime minister of Russia Vladimir Putin, president of the Republic of Mozambique Joaquim Alberto Chissano, president of the Republic of Bolivia Carlos Diego Mesa Gisbert, president of the Republic of Romania Ion Iliescu, president of the Republic of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, the first female president of Finland Tarja Halonen, President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, President Pervez Musharraf of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Iraq President Jalal Talabani, the 14th Dalai Lama, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, financier George Soros, Mayor of New York City Michael R. Bloomberg, President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of Argentina, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and Al Gore.[254]\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Earl Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its role in serving as a venue for meetings and dances of the Columbia Queer Alliance.\nThe Columbia University Orchestra was founded by composer Edward MacDowell in 1896, and is the oldest continually operating university orchestra in the United States. Undergraduate student composers at Columbia may choose to become involved with Columbia New Music, which sponsors concerts of music written by undergraduate students from all of Columbia's schools.[255] The Notes and Keys, the oldest a cappella group at Columbia, was founded in 1909.[256] There are a number of performing arts groups at Columbia dedicated to producing student theater, including the Columbia Players, King's Crown Shakespeare Troupe (KCST), Columbia Musical Theater Society (CMTS), NOMADS (New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students), LateNite Theatre, Columbia University Performing Arts League (CUPAL), Black Theatre Ensemble (BTE), sketch comedy group Chowdah, and improvisational troupes Alfred and Fruit Paunch.[257]\n\n\nThe Columbia Queer Alliance is the central Columbia student organization that represents the bisexual, lesbian, gay, transgender, and questioning student population. It is the oldest gay student organization in the world, founded as the Student Homophile League in 1967 by students including lifelong activist Stephen Donaldson.[258][259]\n\n\nColumbia University campus military groups include the U.S. Military Veterans of Columbia University and Advocates for Columbia ROTC. In the 2005–06 academic year, the Columbia Military Society, Columbia's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates, was renamed the Hamilton Society for \"students who aspire to serve their nation through the military in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton\".[260]\n\n\nThe largest student service organization at Columbia is Community Impact (CI). Founded in 1981, CI provides food, clothing, shelter, education, job training, and companionship for residents in its surrounding communities. CI consists of about 950 Columbia University student volunteers participating in 25 community service programs, which serve more than 8,000 people each year.[261]\n\n\nColumbia has several secret societies, including St. Anthony Hall, which was founded at the university in 1847, and two senior societies, the Nacoms and Sachems.[262][263]\n\n\n\n## Traditions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Columbia University traditions\n\n![](image)The program for *Fly With Me* (1920), one of the only collaborations between Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Lorenz Hart\n### The Varsity Show[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varsity Show\n\nThe Varsity Show is one of the oldest traditions at Columbia. Founded in 1893 as a fundraiser for the university's fledgling athletic teams, the Varsity Show now draws together the entire Columbia undergraduate community for a series of performances every April. Dedicated to producing a unique full-length musical that skewers and satirizes many dubious aspects of life at Columbia, the Varsity Show is written and performed exclusively by university undergraduates. Various renowned playwrights, composers, authors, directors, and actors have contributed to the Varsity Show, either as writers or performers, while students at Columbia, including Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II, Lorenz Hart, Herman J. Mankiewicz, I. A. L. Diamond, Herman Wouk, Greta Gerwig, and Kate McKinnon.[264]\n\n\nNotable past shows include *Fly With Me* (1920), *The* *Streets of New York* (1948), *The Sky's the Limit* (1954), and *Angels at Columbia* (1994). In particular, *Streets of New York*, after having been revived three times, opened off-Broadway in 1963 and was awarded a 1964 Drama Desk Award. *The Mischief Maker* (1903), written by Edgar Allan Woolf and Cassius Freeborn, premiered at Madison Square Garden in 1906 as *Mam'zelle Champagne*.[264][265]\n\n\n\n### Tree Lighting and Yule Log ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTree Lighting at College Walk\n![](image)\nThe first modern Yule Log ceremony in John Jay Hall, 1910\n\nThe campus Tree Lighting ceremony was inaugurated in 1998. It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent Hall and Hamilton Hall on the east end and Dodge Hall and Pulitzer Hall on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sundial for free hot chocolate, performances by *a cappella* groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.[266]\n\n\nImmediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by President Nicholas Murray Butler in 1910. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sundial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of *A Visit From St. Nicholas* by Clement Clarke Moore and *Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus* by Francis Pharcellus Church.[267]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Columbia University people\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Columbia University alumni and attendees; List of Columbia University people in politics, military and law; and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Columbia University as alumni or faculty\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Roosevelt, who attended Columbia Law School. The three core members of Roosevelt's Brain Trust: Adolf A. Berle, Raymond Moley, and Rexford Tugwell, were law professors at Columbia.[344] The Statistical Research Group, which used statistics to analyze military problems during World War II, was composed of Columbia researchers and faculty including George Stigler and Milton Friedman.[345] Columbia faculty and researchers, including Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, Eugene T. Booth, John R. Dunning, George B. Pegram, Walter Zinn, Chien-Shiung Wu, Francis G. Slack, Harold Urey, Herbert L. Anderson, and Isidor Isaac Rabi, also played a significant role during the early phases of the Manhattan Project.[346]\n\n\nFollowing the rise of Nazi Germany, the exiled Institute for Social Research at Goethe University Frankfurt would affiliate itself with Columbia from 1934 to 1950.[347] It was during this period that thinkers including Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, and Herbert Marcuse wrote and published some of the most seminal works of the Frankfurt School, including *Reason and Revolution*, *Dialectic of Enlightenment*, and *Eclipse of Reason*.[348] Professors Edward Said, author of *Orientalism*, and Gayatri Spivak are generally considered as founders of the field of postcolonialism;[349][350] other professors that have significantly contributed to the field include Hamid Dabashi and Joseph Massad.[351][352] The works of professors Kimberlé Crenshaw, Patricia J. Williams, and Kendall Thomas were foundational to the field of critical race theory.[353]\n\n\nColumbia and its affiliated faculty have also made significant contributions to the study of religion. The affiliated Union Theological Seminary is a center of liberal Christianity in the United States, having served as the birthplace of Black theology through the efforts of faculty including James H. Cone and Cornel West,[354][355] and Womanist theology, through the works of Katie Cannon, Emilie Townes, and Delores S. Williams.[356][357][358] Likewise, the Jewish Theological Seminary of America was the birthplace of Conservative Judaism movement in the United States, which was founded and led by faculty members including Solomon Schechter, Alexander Kohut, and Louis Ginzberg in the early 20th century, and is a major center for Jewish studies in general.[359]\n\n\nOther schools of thought in the humanities Columbia professors made significant contributions toward include the Dunning School, founded by William Archibald Dunning;[360][361] the anthropological schools of historical particularism and cultural relativism, founded by Franz Boas;[362] and functional psychology, whose founders and proponents include John Dewey, James McKeen Cattell, Edward L. Thorndike, and Robert S. Woodworth.[363]\n\n\n\nNotable figures that have served as the president of Columbia University include 34th President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower, 4th Vice President of the United States George Clinton, Founding Father and U.S. Senator from Connecticut William Samuel Johnson, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nicholas Murray Butler, and First Amendment scholar Lee Bollinger.[25]\n\n* Notable Columbia University faculty include:\n* ![Zbigniew Brzezinski](image)\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski\n* ![Sonia Sotomayor](image)\n\nSonia Sotomayor\n* ![Kimberlé Crenshaw](image)\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw\n* ![Lee Bollinger](image)\n\nLee Bollinger\n* ![Franz Boas](image)\n\nFranz Boas\n* ![Margaret Mead](image)\n\nMargaret Mead\n* ![Edward Sapir](image)\n\nEdward Sapir\n* ![John Dewey](image)\n\nJohn Dewey\n* ![Charles A.

The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78 billion, of which £711.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4+1⁄2 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (9.7 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university's £1.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3 billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1 billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | —\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H. H. Asquith, Clement Attlee, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Of all the post-war prime ministers, only Gordon Brown was educated at a university other than Oxford (the University of Edinburgh), while Winston Churchill, James Callaghan and John Major never attended a university.[208]\n\n\nOver 100 Oxford alumni were elected to the House of Commons in 2010.[208] This includes former Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband, and numerous members of the cabinet and shadow cabinet. Additionally, over 140 Oxonians sit in the House of Lords.[17]\n\n\n\nInternational leaders who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nAung San Suu Kyi, St Hugh's College\n![](image)\nIndira Gandhi, Somerville College\n![](image)\nBill Clinton, University College\n\nAt least 30 other international leaders have been educated at Oxford.[17] This number includes Harald V of Norway,[209] Abdullah II of Jordan,[17] William II of the Netherlands, five Prime Ministers of Australia (John Gorton, Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, and Malcolm Turnbull),[210][211][212] six Prime Ministers of Pakistan (Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sir Feroz Khan Noon, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto and Imran Khan),[17] two Prime Ministers of Canada (Lester B.

Seretse Khama, first president of Botswana, spent a year at Balliol College. Festus Mogae (former president of Botswana) was a student at University College. The Burmese democracy activist and Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, was a student of St Hugh's College.[218] Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the current reigning Druk Gyalpo (Dragon King) of Bhutan, was a member of Magdalen College.[219] The world's youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, completed a BA in philosophy, politics and economics.[220]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nLawyers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nDavid Neuberger, Christ Church\n![](image)\nRonald Dworkin, Magdalen College\n![](image)\nElena Kagan, Worcester College\nOxford has produced a large number of distinguished jurists, judges and lawyers around the world. Lords Bingham and Denning, commonly recognised as two of the most influential English judges in the history of the common law,[221][222][223][224] both studied at Oxford.

Religious reformer John Wycliffe was an Oxford scholar, for a time Master of Balliol College. John Colet, Christian humanist, Dean of St Paul's, and friend of Erasmus, studied at Magdalen College. Several of the Caroline Divines e.g. in particular William Laud as President of St. John's and Chancellor of the university, and the Non-Jurors, e.g. Thomas Ken had close Oxford connections. The founder of Methodism, John Wesley, studied at Christ Church and was elected a fellow of Lincoln College.[281] Britain's first woman to be an ordained minister, Constance Coltman, studied at Somerville College. The Oxford Movement (1833–1846) was closely associated with the Oriel fellows John Henry Newman, Edward Bouverie Pusey and John Keble. Other religious figures were Mirza Nasir Ahmad, the third Caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Shoghi Effendi, one of the appointed leaders of the Baháʼí Faith, and Joseph Cordeiro, the first Pakistani Catholic cardinal.[282]\n\n\n\n### Philosophy[edit]\n\n\nPhilosophers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nJohn Locke, Christ Church\n![](image)\nMary Midgley, Somerville College\n![](image)\nThomas Hobbes, Hertford College\n\nOxford's philosophical tradition started in the medieval era, with Robert Grosseteste[283] and William of Ockham,[283] commonly known for Occam's razor, among those teaching at the university. Thomas Hobbes,[284][285] Jeremy Bentham and the empiricist John Locke received degrees from Oxford. Though the latter's main works were written after leaving Oxford, Locke was heavily influenced by his twelve years at the university.[283]\n\n\nOxford philosophers of the 20th century include Richard Swinburne, a leading philosopher in the tradition of substance dualism; Peter Hacker, philosopher of mind, language, anthropology, and he is also known for his critique of cognitive neuroscience; J.L.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of £2.78 billion, of which £711.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of Étampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333–1334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642–1649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM. C. Curthoys and H. S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914–1918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833–1845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012–2013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400 m × 25 m) Castle Mill development of 4–5-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28 ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8 ha (4+1⁄2 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53 ha) site six miles (9.7 km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0 km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017–18, the university had an income of £2,237m; key sources were research grants (£579.1m) and academic fees (£332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of £492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over £6.4bn compared to the university's £1.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of £6.3 billion also exceed total university assets of £4.1 billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking – The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of £1.25 billion in March 2012, the target was raised to £3 billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of £2.8 billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving £10,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken £100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of £20 million was received from Wafic Saïd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking £150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received £21.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and £18.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted £6 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | —\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over £6 million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1–4 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of £10,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11 million volumes housed on 120 miles (190 km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Saïd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[12][13]\n\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh.[27] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\n\n\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge movement (philosophy)\n\n![](image)Selwyn College, founded in 1882\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city's residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[46]\n\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n![](image)Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens' College\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge's extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King's College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880.[49] The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFront Court of King's College, founded in 1441 by King Henry VI\n\n## Locations and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\n![](image)The Faculty of Education building\n![](image)The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King's College Chapel seen from St John's College Chapel on the left. In front of King's College Chapel is the Senate House.\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Gonville and Caius College\n![](image)Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall\n![](image)The President's Lodge at Queens' College\n![](image)Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John's College\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n1. ![Christ's College heraldic shield](image) Christ's\n2. ![Churchill College heraldic shield](image) Churchill\n3. ![Clare College heraldic shield](image) Clare\n4. ![Clare Hall heraldic shield](image) Clare Hall\n5. ![Corpus Christi heraldic shield](image) Corpus Christi\n6. ![Darwin College heraldic shield](image) Darwin\n7. ![Downing College heraldic shield](image) Downing\n8. ![Emmanuel College heraldic shield](image) Emmanuel\n9. ![Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield](image) Fitzwilliam\n10. ![](image) Girton\n11. ![Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield](image) Gonville & Caius\n12. ![](image) Homerton\n13. ![Hughes Hall heraldic shield](image) Hughes Hall\n14. ![Jesus College heraldic shield](image) Jesus\n15. ![King's College heraldic shield](image) King's\n16. ![Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield](image) Lucy Cavendish\n17. ![Magdalene College heraldic shield](image) Magdalene\n18. ![](image) Murray Edwards\n19. ![Newnham College heraldic shield](image) Newnham\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge § Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\nThe current acting vice-chancellor is Anthony Freeling, who was appointed in 2022[82] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor serves as the university's *de facto* principal administrative officer. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by Regent House augmented by some external representation from the Audit Committee and four external members of the University's Council.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Senate and the Regent House[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Light show on Senate House for the 800th anniversary of the university's founding\n![](image)Old Court at Clare College\nThe university Senate consists of all holders of the MA or higher degrees and is responsible for electing the Chancellor and the High Steward. Until 1950 when the Cambridge University constituency was abolished, it was also responsible for electing two members of the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, the university Senate was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that Regent House has provided since.[84] Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[85] Public representatives of Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year terms upon their nominations by the colleges.\n\n\n\n#### Council and General Board[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate House Passage in the snow with Senate House on the right and Gonville and Caius College on the left\nAlthough the University Council is the university's principal executive and policy-making body, the Council reports to, and is held accountable by, Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. The council is obliged to advise Regent House on matters of general concern to the university, which it does by publishing notices to the *Cambridge University Reporter*, the university's official journal.[86] In March 2008, Regent House voted to increase from two to four the number of external members on the council,[87][88] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[89]\n\n\nThe General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the university's academic and educational policies[90] and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs.\n\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210 million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations and memberships[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the International Alliance of Research Universities, and it is part of the so-called golden triangle of research intensive universities in the south of England.[97] It is also closely linked to the high tech business cluster known as Silicon Fen and is part of Cambridge University Health Partners, Europe's largest academic health science centre.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | —\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\nThe university's standard offer for most courses is set at A\\*AA,[112][113] with A\\*A\\*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant's respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice of college.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Winter pool[edit]\n\n\nThe **Winter Pool** or **inter-College Pool** is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission.[120] Approximately 20–25% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university's admissions decisions.[121]\n\n\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them.[121] Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\n\n\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college's discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.[122]\n\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as **S**, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.[123]\n\n\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.[121]\n\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.[137] Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.[138]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university.[141] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\n\n\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.[142]\n\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week.[144] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials,[145] and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\n\n\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[146]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony.\n![](image)University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into Senate House for graduation\nThe university's governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose,[148] which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalised. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\n\n\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older.[149] Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university's royal colleges.\n\n\nDuring the University of Cambridge's congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\n\n\n\n\n> \"*Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.*\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\n\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Trinity College's Wren Library\n![](image)Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries.[150] Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[151]\n\n\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College's Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden.[152] Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle's Yard is the university's contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum. Cambridge University Museum of Zoology also holds specimens collected by Charles Darwin, an 1831 University of Cambridge alumnus. Other museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million. [155]\n\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge. Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world's most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments. Among the most prominent of them are:\n\n\n\n* Adam Smith Prize, awarded annually to the university's top-performing student in economics\n* Adams Prize, awarded annually by University of Cambridge mathematics faculty to a UK resident in recognition of distinguished research in mathematics\n* Browne Medal, awarded annually to students who win the Latin and Greek poetry competition\n* Carus Greek Testament Prizes, a prize issued to winners of an annual competition of the university's undergraduate and graduate in Greek translation of New Testament passeges\n* Chancellor's Gold Medal, a prize issued to winners of the university's annual poetry competition\n* Porson Prize, a prize for students who develop the best Greek composition\n* Raymond Horton-Smith Prize, awarded annually to the University of Cambridge Medical School student for the best medical school thesis\n* Seatonian Prize, awarded annually for the best English language poem on a sacred subject\n* Senior Wrangler, awarded annually to the university's top performing student on the Mathematical Tripos described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n* Thirlwall Prize, awarded every other year for the best essay about British literature or history\n* Thomas Bond Sprague Prize, awarded to the student with the best performing score on Part III of the Mathematical Tripos\n* Tyson Medal, awarded annually to the top astronomy student\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[157] | 1 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[158] | 3 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[159] | 3 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[160] | 4 |\n| *QS* (2025)[161] | 2 |\n| *THE* (2024)[162] | 5 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Cambridge's national league table performance over the past ten years\nThe University of Cambridge is routinely ranked among the world's top five universities, and has sometimes been ranked as the world's best. As of 2023, the University of Cambridge is ranked the second-best university in the world behind the MIT and the best university in Europe by *QS Rankings*.[163] *ARWU* ranks Cambridge the fourth-best university in the world as of 2023 behind Harvard, Stanford, and MIT.[164] *Times Higher Education* ranks Cambridge third-best in the world (tied with Stanford) in its 2023 rankings behind Oxford and Harvard.[165]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *QS Rankings* ranked Cambridge's programmes among the world's best. Cambridge's Arts and Humanities program is ranked second-best in the world. The University of Cambridge's Engineering and Technology program is ranked second-best in the world. Its Life Sciences and Medicine program is ranked fourth-best in the world. Its Natural Sciences program is ranked third-best in the world. Its Social Sciences and Management program is ranked fourth-best in the world.[166]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Times Higher Education* recognised the University of Cambridge as one of the world's six super brands in its \"World Reputation Rankings\" along with Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, and Stanford.[167]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been highly ranked by most international and UK league tables. It was ranked the best university in the world by *QS World University Rankings* in both their 2010–11 and 2011–12 rankings.[168][169]\n\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The bridge over the River Cam at Clare College during the 2005 May Ball in Cambridge\n![](image)The University Centre main dining hall\nOne privilege of student life at the University of Cambridge is the opportunity to attend formal dinners at a student's respective college, known as Formal Hall that are held regularly during academic terms and daily at some of the university's colleges. During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.[172]\n\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests. As of 2010[update], there were 751 registered societies at the university.[175] In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.\n\n\nAlthough technically independent from the university, Cambridge Union, a globally-renowned debate organization and the oldest debate organization in the world, offers students high-level debate and public speaking experience. Drama societies include the Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC) and the comedy club Footlights, whose alumni include many well-known show business personalities. The university's Chamber Orchestra, composed entirely of university students, offers a range of orchestra programs, including symphonies.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Sport at the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Cricket Club, List of Cambridge University Boat Race crews, and Cambridge University Polo Club\n\n![](image)The boathouse of the Cambridge University Boat Club\nRowing is one of the most popular sports at the University of Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges, notably the bumps races. The University of Cambridge's rowing competition against Oxford is known as Boat Race. Varsity matches against Oxford also exist in other sports, including cricket, rugby, chess, and tiddlywinks. Athletes who representing the university in a varsity match are entitled to a Blue or a Half Blue, depending on the sport and other criteria.[176]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge Sports Centre opened in August 2013. Phase one included a sports hall, a fitness suite, a strength and conditioning room, a multi-purpose room, and Eton and Rugby fives courts. Phase two of its development included five glass-backed squash courts and a team training room. Future phases include indoor and outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool.[177]\n\n\nThe university also has an athletic track at Wilberforce Road, an indoor cricket school, and Fenner's, the cricket ground for Cambridge University Cricket Club.\n\n\nThe Hawks' Club is a private members' club for the university's leading sportsmen.[176] The Ospreys are the equivalent female club.\n\n\n\n### Student newspapers and radio[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Publications associated with the University of Cambridge\n\nCambridge's oldest student newspaper is *Varsity*. Established in 1947, notable figures who have edited the newspaper include Jeremy Paxman, BBC media editor Amol Rajan, and *Vogue* international editor Suzy Menkes. The student newspaper also has featured the early writings of Zadie Smith, who appeared in *Varsity*'s literary anthology offshoot *The Mays*, Robert Webb, Tristram Hunt, and Tony Wilson.\n\n\n*Varsity* has a circulation of 9,000 and is the only student publication published weekly. News stories from *Varsity* have appeared in *The Guardian*, *The Times*, *The Sunday Times*, *The Daily Telegraph*, *The Independent*, and *i*.\n\n\nOther student publications include *The Cambridge Student*, which is funded by Cambridge Students' Union and is published fortnightly, *The Tab*, and *The Mays* Founded by two University of Cambridge students in 2009, *The Tab* is an online media outlet featuring light-hearted features content. *The Mays* is a literary anthology including student prose, poetry, and visual art from both University of Cambridge and Oxford students. Founded in 1992 by three Cambridge students, the anthology publishes once a year and is overseen by Varsity Publications Ltd., the same body responsible for *Varsity*. Another literary journal, *Notes*, is published roughly twice per term. Additionally, many colleges have their own student-run publications.\n\n\nThe student radio station, Cam FM, is run jointly by University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University students. The station holds an FM licence (frequency 97.2 MHz), and hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Cambridge people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge and Alumni Cantabrigienses\n\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[12][13]\n\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh.[27] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\n\n\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge movement (philosophy)\n\n![](image)Selwyn College, founded in 1882\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city's residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[46]\n\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n![](image)Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens' College\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge's extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King's College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880.[49] The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFront Court of King's College, founded in 1441 by King Henry VI\n\n## Locations and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\n![](image)The Faculty of Education building\n![](image)The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King's College Chapel seen from St John's College Chapel on the left. In front of King's College Chapel is the Senate House.\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Gonville and Caius College\n![](image)Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall\n![](image)The President's Lodge at Queens' College\n![](image)Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John's College\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n1. ![Christ's College heraldic shield](image) Christ's\n2. ![Churchill College heraldic shield](image) Churchill\n3. ![Clare College heraldic shield](image) Clare\n4. ![Clare Hall heraldic shield](image) Clare Hall\n5. ![Corpus Christi heraldic shield](image) Corpus Christi\n6. ![Darwin College heraldic shield](image) Darwin\n7. ![Downing College heraldic shield](image) Downing\n8. ![Emmanuel College heraldic shield](image) Emmanuel\n9. ![Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield](image) Fitzwilliam\n10. ![](image) Girton\n11. ![Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield](image) Gonville & Caius\n12. ![](image) Homerton\n13. ![Hughes Hall heraldic shield](image) Hughes Hall\n14. ![Jesus College heraldic shield](image) Jesus\n15. ![King's College heraldic shield](image) King's\n16. ![Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield](image) Lucy Cavendish\n17. ![Magdalene College heraldic shield](image) Magdalene\n18. ![](image) Murray Edwards\n19. ![Newnham College heraldic shield](image) Newnham\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge § Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\nThe current acting vice-chancellor is Anthony Freeling, who was appointed in 2022[82] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor serves as the university's *de facto* principal administrative officer. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by Regent House augmented by some external representation from the Audit Committee and four external members of the University's Council.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Senate and the Regent House[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Light show on Senate House for the 800th anniversary of the university's founding\n![](image)Old Court at Clare College\nThe university Senate consists of all holders of the MA or higher degrees and is responsible for electing the Chancellor and the High Steward. Until 1950 when the Cambridge University constituency was abolished, it was also responsible for electing two members of the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, the university Senate was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that Regent House has provided since.[84] Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[85] Public representatives of Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year terms upon their nominations by the colleges.\n\n\n\n#### Council and General Board[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate House Passage in the snow with Senate House on the right and Gonville and Caius College on the left\nAlthough the University Council is the university's principal executive and policy-making body, the Council reports to, and is held accountable by, Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. The council is obliged to advise Regent House on matters of general concern to the university, which it does by publishing notices to the *Cambridge University Reporter*, the university's official journal.[86] In March 2008, Regent House voted to increase from two to four the number of external members on the council,[87][88] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[89]\n\n\nThe General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the university's academic and educational policies[90] and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs.\n\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210 million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations and memberships[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the International Alliance of Research Universities, and it is part of the so-called golden triangle of research intensive universities in the south of England.[97] It is also closely linked to the high tech business cluster known as Silicon Fen and is part of Cambridge University Health Partners, Europe's largest academic health science centre.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | —\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\nThe university's standard offer for most courses is set at A\\*AA,[112][113] with A\\*A\\*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant's respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice of college.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Winter pool[edit]\n\n\nThe **Winter Pool** or **inter-College Pool** is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission.[120] Approximately 20–25% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university's admissions decisions.[121]\n\n\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them.[121] Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\n\n\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college's discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.[122]\n\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as **S**, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.[123]\n\n\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.[121]\n\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.[137] Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.[138]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university.[141] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\n\n\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.[142]\n\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week.[144] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials,[145] and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\n\n\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[146]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony.\n![](image)University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into Senate House for graduation\nThe university's governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose,[148] which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalised. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\n\n\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older.[149] Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university's royal colleges.\n\n\nDuring the University of Cambridge's congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\n\n\n\n\n> \"*Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.*\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\n\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Trinity College's Wren Library\n![](image)Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries.[150] Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[151]\n\n\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College's Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden.[152] Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle's Yard is the university's contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum. Cambridge University Museum of Zoology also holds specimens collected by Charles Darwin, an 1831 University of Cambridge alumnus. Other museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million. [155]\n\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students. It also issues some awards to those of varying global academic accomplishment regardless of whether their recipient is affiliated with the University of Cambridge. Some of these awards and prizes rank among the world's most estimable academic and intellectual accomplishments. Among the most prominent of them are:\n\n\n\n* Adam Smith Prize, awarded annually to the university's top-performing student in economics\n* Adams Prize, awarded annually by University of Cambridge mathematics faculty to a UK resident in recognition of distinguished research in mathematics\n* Browne Medal, awarded annually to students who win the Latin and Greek poetry competition\n* Carus Greek Testament Prizes, a prize issued to winners of an annual competition of the university's undergraduate and graduate in Greek translation of New Testament passeges\n* Chancellor's Gold Medal, a prize issued to winners of the university's annual poetry competition\n* Porson Prize, a prize for students who develop the best Greek composition\n* Raymond Horton-Smith Prize, awarded annually to the University of Cambridge Medical School student for the best medical school thesis\n* Seatonian Prize, awarded annually for the best English language poem on a sacred subject\n* Senior Wrangler, awarded annually to the university's top performing student on the Mathematical Tripos described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n* Thirlwall Prize, awarded every other year for the best essay about British literature or history\n* Thomas Bond Sprague Prize, awarded to the student with the best performing score on Part III of the Mathematical Tripos\n* Tyson Medal, awarded annually to the top astronomy student\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[157] | 1 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[158] | 3 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[159] | 3 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[160] | 4 |\n| *QS* (2025)[161] | 2 |\n| *THE* (2024)[162] | 5 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Cambridge's national league table performance over the past ten years\nThe University of Cambridge is routinely ranked among the world's top five universities, and has sometimes been ranked as the world's best. As of 2023, the University of Cambridge is ranked the second-best university in the world behind the MIT and the best university in Europe by *QS Rankings*.[163] *ARWU* ranks Cambridge the fourth-best university in the world as of 2023 behind Harvard, Stanford, and MIT.[164] *Times Higher Education* ranks Cambridge third-best in the world (tied with Stanford) in its 2023 rankings behind Oxford and Harvard.[165]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *QS Rankings* ranked Cambridge's programmes among the world's best. Cambridge's Arts and Humanities program is ranked second-best in the world. The University of Cambridge's Engineering and Technology program is ranked second-best in the world. Its Life Sciences and Medicine program is ranked fourth-best in the world. Its Natural Sciences program is ranked third-best in the world. Its Social Sciences and Management program is ranked fourth-best in the world.[166]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Times Higher Education* recognised the University of Cambridge as one of the world's six super brands in its \"World Reputation Rankings\" along with Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Oxford, and Stanford.[167]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been highly ranked by most international and UK league tables. It was ranked the best university in the world by *QS World University Rankings* in both their 2010–11 and 2011–12 rankings.[168][169]\n\n\nIn 2006, a Thomson Scientific study reported that the University of Cambridge had the highest research paper output of any British university and ranked first in research production as assessed by total paper citation count in ten of 21 major British research fields.[170] An evidence-based study published the same year showed that the University of Cambridge won a larger proportion (6.6%) of total British research grants and contracts than any other university, ranking first in three out of four major measured discipline fields.[171]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Cambridge, List of organisations and institutions associated with the University of Cambridge, and List of social activities at the University of Cambridge\n\n### Formal halls and May balls[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The bridge over the River Cam at Clare College during the 2005 May Ball in Cambridge\n![](image)The University Centre main dining hall\nOne privilege of student life at the University of Cambridge is the opportunity to attend formal dinners at a student's respective college, known as Formal Hall that are held regularly during academic terms and daily at some of the university's colleges. During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.[172]\n\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests. As of 2010[update], there were 751 registered societies at the university.[175] In addition to these, individual colleges often promote their own societies and sports teams.\n\n\nAlthough technically independent from the university, Cambridge Union, a globally-renowned debate organization and the oldest debate organization in the world, offers students high-level debate and public speaking experience. Drama societies include the Amateur Dramatic Club (ADC) and the comedy club Footlights, whose alumni include many well-known show business personalities. The university's Chamber Orchestra, composed entirely of university students, offers a range of orchestra programs, including symphonies.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Sport at the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Cricket Club, List of Cambridge University Boat Race crews, and Cambridge University Polo Club\n\n![](image)The boathouse of the Cambridge University Boat Club\nRowing is one of the most popular sports at the University of Cambridge, and there are competitions between colleges, notably the bumps races. The University of Cambridge's rowing competition against Oxford is known as Boat Race. Varsity matches against Oxford also exist in other sports, including cricket, rugby, chess, and tiddlywinks. Athletes who representing the university in a varsity match are entitled to a Blue or a Half Blue, depending on the sport and other criteria.[176]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge Sports Centre opened in August 2013. Phase one included a sports hall, a fitness suite, a strength and conditioning room, a multi-purpose room, and Eton and Rugby fives courts. Phase two of its development included five glass-backed squash courts and a team training room. Future phases include indoor and outdoor tennis courts and a swimming pool.[177]\n\n\nThe university also has an athletic track at Wilberforce Road, an indoor cricket school, and Fenner's, the cricket ground for Cambridge University Cricket Club.\n\n\nThe Hawks' Club is a private members' club for the university's leading sportsmen.[176] The Ospreys are the equivalent female club.\n\n\n\n### Student newspapers and radio[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Publications associated with the University of Cambridge\n\nCambridge's oldest student newspaper is *Varsity*. Established in 1947, notable figures who have edited the newspaper include Jeremy Paxman, BBC media editor Amol Rajan, and *Vogue* international editor Suzy Menkes. The student newspaper also has featured the early writings of Zadie Smith, who appeared in *Varsity*'s literary anthology offshoot *The Mays*, Robert Webb, Tristram Hunt, and Tony Wilson.\n\n\n*Varsity* has a circulation of 9,000 and is the only student publication published weekly. News stories from *Varsity* have appeared in *The Guardian*, *The Times*, *The Sunday Times*, *The Daily Telegraph*, *The Independent*, and *i*.\n\n\nOther student publications include *The Cambridge Student*, which is funded by Cambridge Students' Union and is published fortnightly, *The Tab*, and *The Mays* Founded by two University of Cambridge students in 2009, *The Tab* is an online media outlet featuring light-hearted features content. *The Mays* is a literary anthology including student prose, poetry, and visual art from both University of Cambridge and Oxford students. Founded in 1992 by three Cambridge students, the anthology publishes once a year and is overseen by Varsity Publications Ltd., the same body responsible for *Varsity*. Another literary journal, *Notes*, is published roughly twice per term. Additionally, many colleges have their own student-run publications.\n\n\nThe student radio station, Cam FM, is run jointly by University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University students. The station holds an FM licence (frequency 97.2 MHz), and hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Cambridge people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge and Alumni Cantabrigienses\n\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.

Founded by the town council under the authority of a royal charter of King James VI in 1582 and officially opened in 1583, it is one of Scotland's four ancient universities and the sixth-oldest university in continuous operation in the English-speaking world.[1] The university played an important role in Edinburgh becoming a chief intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed to the city being nicknamed the \"Athens of the North.\"[7][8]\n\n\nEdinburgh is ranked 22nd in the world by the QS World University Rankings,[9] 30th by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[10] and 38th by the Academic Ranking of World Universities.[11] It is a member of several associations of research-intensive universities, including the Coimbra Group, League of European Research Universities, Russell Group, Una Europa, and Universitas 21.[12] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, it had a total income of £1.262 billion, of which £331.6 million was from research grants and contracts. It has the third-largest endowment in the UK, behind only Cambridge and Oxford.[2] The university occupies five main campuses in the city of Edinburgh, which include many buildings of historical and architectural significance such as those in the Old Town.[13]\n\n\nEdinburgh is the seventh-largest university in the UK by enrolment[4] and receives over 75,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the second-most popular university in the UK by volume of applications.[14] Edinburgh had the eighth-highest average UCAS points amongst British universities for new entrants in 2020.[15] The university continues to have links to the royal family, having had Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as its chancellor from 1953 to 2010 and Anne, Princess Royal since March 2011.[16]\n\n\nAlumni of the university include inventor Alexander Graham Bell, naturalist Charles Darwin, philosopher David Hume, physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and writers such as Sir J. M. Barrie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, J. K. Rowling, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson.[17][18] The university counts several heads of state and government amongst its graduates, including three British Prime Ministers. Three Supreme Court Justices of the UK were educated at Edinburgh. As of January 2023[update], 19 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, three Turing Award winners, and an Abel Prize laureate and Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Edinburgh as alumni or academic staff.[19] Edinburgh alumni have won a total of ten Olympic gold medals.[b]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Rollock, Regent (1583–1586) and first principal (1586–1599) of the University of Edinburgh\nIn 1557, Bishop Robert Reid of St Magnus Cathedral on Orkney made a will containing an endowment of 8,000 merks to build a college in Edinburgh.[20] Unusually for his time, Reid's vision included the teaching of rhetoric and poetry, alongside more traditional subjects such as philosophy.[20] However, the bequest was delayed by more than 25 years due to the religious revolution that led to the Reformation Parliament of 1560.[20] The plans were revived in the late 1570s through efforts by the Edinburgh Town Council, first minister of Edinburgh James Lawson, and Lord Provost William Little.[1] When Reid's descendants were unwilling to pay out the sum, the town council petitioned King James VI and his Privy Council. The King brokered a monetary compromise and granted a royal charter on 14 April 1582, empowering the town council to create a college of higher education.[20][21][22] A college established by secular authorities was unprecedented in newly Presbyterian Scotland, as all previous Scottish universities had been founded through papal bulls.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Main buildings of King James' College in 1647, lying in a double courtyard on the lower left\n![](image)Frontispiece to earliest laureation (graduation) register (1587)\nNamed *Tounis College* (Town's College), the university opened its doors to students on 14 October 1583, with an attendance of 80–90.[1] At the time, the college mainly covered liberal arts and divinity.[24][25] Instruction began under the charge of a graduate from the University of St Andrews, theologian Robert Rollock, who first served as Regent, and from 1586 as principal of the college.[26] Initially Rollock was the sole instructor for first-year students, and he was expected to tutor the 1583 intake for all four years of their degree in every subject. The first cohort finished their studies in 1587, and 47 students graduated (or 'laureated') with an M.A. degree.[26] When King James VI visited Scotland in 1617, he held a disputation with the college's professors, after which he decreed that it should henceforth be called the \"Colledge *[sic]* of King James\".[27][28] The university was known as both *Tounis College* and *King James' College* until it gradually assumed the name of the University of Edinburgh during the 17th century.[24][29]\n\n\nAfter the deposition of King James II and VII during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Parliament of Scotland passed legislation designed to root out Jacobite sympathisers amongst university staff.[30] In Edinburgh, this led to the dismissal of Principal Alexander Monro and several professors and regents after a government visitation in 1690. The university was subsequently led by Principal Gilbert Rule, one of the inquisitors on the visitation committee.[30]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th century[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"You are now in a place where the best courses upon earth are within your reach... Such an opportunity you will never again have. I would therefore strongly press on you to fix no other limit to your stay in Edinborough than your having got thro this whole course. The omission of any one part of it will be an affliction & loss to you as long as you live.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas Jefferson, writing to his son-in-law Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr. in 1786.[31]\n\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries were marked by a power struggle between the university and town council, which had ultimate authority over staff appointments, curricula, and examinations.[32] After a series of challenges by the university, the conflict culminated in the council seizing the college records in 1704.[32] Relations were only gradually repaired over the next 150 years and suffered repeated setbacks.\n\n\nThe university expanded by founding a Faculty of Law in 1707, a Faculty of Arts in 1708, and a Faculty of Medicine in 1726.[33] In 1762, Reverend Hugh Blair was appointed by King George III as the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres.[34] This formalised literature as a subject and marks the foundation of the English Literature department, making Edinburgh the oldest centre of literary education in Britain.[35]\n\n\nDuring the 18th century, the university was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment.[36] The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment fell on especially fertile ground in Edinburgh because of the university's democratic and secular origin; its organization as a single entity instead of loosely connected colleges, which encouraged academic exchange; its adoption of the more flexible Dutch model of professorship, rather than having student cohorts taught by a single regent; and the lack of land endowments as its source of income, which meant its faculty operated in a more competitive environment.[37] Between 1750 and 1800, this system produced and attracted key Enlightenment figures such as chemist Joseph Black, economist Adam Smith, historian William Robertson, philosophers David Hume and Dugald Stewart, physician William Cullen, and early sociologist Adam Ferguson, many of which taught concurrently.[37] By the time the Royal Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1783, the university was regarded as one of the world's preeminent scientific institutions,[38] and Voltaire called Edinburgh a \"hotbed of genius\" as a result.[39] Benjamin Franklin believed that the university possessed \"a set of as truly great men, Professors of the Several Branches of Knowledge, as have ever appeared in any Age or Country\".[40] Thomas Jefferson felt that as far as science was concerned, \"no place in the world can pretend to a competition with Edinburgh\".[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)The east facade of Old College facing onto South Bridge, as built in 1827. A dome similar to Adam's original design was added in 1887 by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson.\n![piece of parchment of charter of novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582](image)A Charter of Novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582, to establish a college\nIn 1785, Henry Dundas introduced the South Bridge Act in the House of Commons; one of the bill's goals was to use South Bridge as a location for the university, which had existed in a hotchpotch of buildings since its establishment. The site was used to construct Old College, the university's first custom-built building, by architect William Henry Playfair to plans by Robert Adam.[42] During the 18th century, the university developed a particular forte in teaching anatomy and the developing science of surgery, and it was considered one of the best medical schools in the English-speaking world.[43] Bodies to be used for dissection were brought to the university's Anatomy Theatre through a secret tunnel from a nearby house (today's College Wynd student accommodation), which was also used by murderers Burke and Hare to deliver the corpses of their victims during the 1820s.[44][45]\n\n\nAfter 275 years of governance by the town council, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858 gave the university full authority over its own affairs.[32] The act established governing bodies including a university court and a general council, and redefined the roles of key officials like the chancellor, rector, and principal.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque commemorating the Edinburgh Seven at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh\nThe Edinburgh Seven were the first group of matriculated undergraduate female students at any British university.[47] Led by Sophia Jex-Blake, they began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869. Although the university blocked them from graduating and qualifying as doctors, their campaign gained national attention and won them many supporters, including Charles Darwin.[48] Their efforts put the rights of women to higher education on the national political agenda, which eventually resulted in legislation allowing women to study at all Scottish universities in 1889. The university admitted women to graduate in medicine in 1893.[49][50] In 2015, the Edinburgh Seven were commemorated with a plaque at the university,[51] and in 2019 they were posthumously awarded with medical degrees.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buildings of the Old Medical School at Teviot Place, photographed in the late 19th century\n![](image)Exterior of the McEwan Hall\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded. After a bequest from Sir David Baxter, the university started planning new buildings in earnest. Sir Robert Rowand Anderson won the public architectural competition and was commissioned to design new premises for the Medical School in 1877.[53] Initially, the design incorporated a campanile and a hall for examination and graduation, but this was seen as too ambitious. The new Medical School opened in 1884, but the building was not completed until 1888.[54] After funds were donated by politician and brewer William McEwan in 1894, a separate graduation building was constructed after all, also designed by Anderson.[55] The resulting McEwan Hall on Bristo Square was presented to the university in 1897.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Teviot Row House, drawn by architect Sydney Mitchell in 1888\nThe Students' Representative Council (SRC) was founded in 1884 by student Robert Fitzroy Bell.[57][58] In 1889, the SRC voted to establish Edinburgh University Union (EUU), to be housed in Teviot Row House on Bristo Square.[59] Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU) was founded in 1866, and Edinburgh University Women's Union (renamed the Chambers Street Union in 1964) in October 1905.[60] The SRC, EUU and Chambers Street Union merged to form Edinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) on 1 July 1973.[61][62]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, the Science and Medicine buildings had suffered from a lack of repairs or upgrades, which was exacerbated by an influx of students after the end of the war.[63] In 1919, the university bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city for the development of a new satellite campus specialising in the sciences.[64] On 6 July 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the first new building (now called the Joseph Black Building), housing the Department of Chemistry.[63] The campus was named King's Buildings in honour of George V.\n\n\n\n![](image)Facade of New College facing onto The Mound in 1910\nNew College on The Mound was originally opened in 1846 as a Free Church of Scotland college, later of the United Free Church of Scotland.[65] Since the 1930s it has been the home of the School of Divinity. Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the Church of Scotland studied in the university's Faculty of Divinity.[66] In 1935 the two institutions merged, with all operations moved to the New College site in Old Town.[67] This freed up Old College for Edinburgh Law School.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque honouring the Polish School of Medicine at the old Medical School\nThe Polish School of Medicine was established in 1941 as a wartime academic initiative. While it was originally intended for students and doctors in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, civilians were also allowed to take the courses, which were taught in Polish and awarded Polish medical degrees.[69] When the school was closed in 1949, 336 students had matriculated, of which 227 students graduated with the equivalent of an MBChB and a total of 19 doctors obtained a doctorate or MD.[70] A bronze plaque commemorating the Polish School of Medicine is located in the Quadrangle of the old Medical School in Teviot Place.[71]\n\n\nOn 10 May 1951, the *Royal (Dick) Veterinary College*, founded in 1823 by William Dick,[72] was reconstituted as the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and officially became part of the university.[73] It achieved full faculty status as Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1964.\n\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, there were around 7,000 students matriculating annually, more than doubling the numbers from the turn of the century.[74] The university addressed this partially through the redevelopment of George Square, demolishing much of the area's historic houses and erecting modern buildings such as 40 George Square, Appleton Tower and the Main Library.[75]\n\n\nOn 1 August 1998, the *Moray House Institute of Education*, founded in 1848, merged with the University of Edinburgh, becoming its Faculty of Education. Following the internal restructuring of the university in 2002, Moray House became known as the Moray House School of Education.[76] It was renamed the Moray House School of Education and Sport in August 2019.[77]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s it became apparent that the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place were no longer adequate for a modern teaching hospital. Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary at the time, authorized a joint project between private finance, local authorities, and the university to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh.[78] The new campus was named the BioQuarter. The Chancellor's Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.[79] In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald.[80][81] In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic,[82] which was officially opened in October 2013.[83] The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012.[84] CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Atrium of the Informatics Forum\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate Fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge.[86][87] This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site.[88] In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.[89]\n\n\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.[90] In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.[91][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh College of Art\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011.[93][94] In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English.[95] The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.[96]\n\n\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016.[97] The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.[98]\n\n\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion *Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal*, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region.[99] The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the *Data-Driven Innovation* initiative.[100] In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the *Richard Verney Health Centre* at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services.[103] The university's largest current expansion project is the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million renovations and extension will provide space for the *Edinburgh Futures Institute*, an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of 'complex futures'.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Historical links[edit]\n\n\nEdinburgh has a number of historical links to other universities, chiefly through its influential Medical School and its graduates, who established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.\n\n\n\n* College of William & Mary: the second-oldest college in the US was founded in 1693 by Edinburgh graduate James Blair, who served as the college's founding president for fifty years.[106]\n* Columbia University: had its Medical School founded by Samuel Bard, an Edinburgh medical graduate.\n* Dalhousie University: Edinburgh alumnus George Ramsay, the 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, wanted to establish a non-denominational college in Halifax open to all.[107] The school was modelled after the University of Edinburgh, which students could attend regardless of religion or nationality.[108]\n* Dartmouth College: had its School of Medicine founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.[109]\n* Harvard University: had its Medical School founded by three surgeons, one of whom was Benjamin Waterhouse, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.[110]\n* McGill University: had its Faculty of Medicine founded by four physicians, which included Edinburgh alumni Andrew Fernando Holmes and John Stephenson.[111][112]\n* University of Pennsylvania: had its School of Medicine founded by Edinburgh graduate John Morgan, who modelled it after Edinburgh Medical School.[113][114]\n* Princeton University: had its academic syllabus and structure reformed along the lines of the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities by its sixth president John Witherspoon, an Edinburgh theology graduate.[115][116]\n* University of Sydney: founded in 1850 by Sir Charles Nicholson, a graduate of Edinburgh Medical School.\n* Yale University: had its School of Medicine co-founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\n\n\n## Campuses and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![University of Edinburgh is located in Edinburgh](image)![Central Area](image)\nCentral Area\n![King's Buildings](image)\nKing's Buildings\n![BioQuarter](image)\nBioQuarter\n![Western General](image)\nWestern General\n![Holyrood](image)\nHolyrood\n![Pollock Halls](image)\nPollock Halls\n![Easter Bush](image)\nEaster Bush\nclass=notpageimage|\nMain locations of the University of Edinburgh.

It is the university's oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics. The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area's largest lecture hall. Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences.[45] The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston. North of George Square lies the university's Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia's Hall. Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Pollock Halls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pollock Halls of Residence\n\n![](image)St Leonard's Hall\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university's largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year. The complex houses over 2,000 students during term time and consists of ten named buildings with communal green spaces between them.[120] The two original buildings, St Leonard's Hall and Salisbury Green, were built in the 19th century, while the majority of Pollock Halls dates from the 1960s and early 2000s. Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor's Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003. Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation. The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university's premier conference space.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Holyrood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Moray House School of Education\n\nThe Holyrood campus, just off the Royal Mile, used to be the site for *Moray House Institute for Education* until it merged with the university on 1 August 1998.[76] The university has since extended this campus.[122] The buildings include redeveloped and extended Sports Science, Physical Education and Leisure Management facilities at St Leonard's Land linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance.[123] The £80 million O'Shea Hall at Holyrood was named after the former principal of the university Sir Timothy O'Shea and was opened by Princess Anne in 2017, providing a living and social environment for postgraduate students.[124] The Outreach Centre, Institute for Academic Development (University Services Group), and Edinburgh Centre for Professional Legal Studies are also located at Holyrood.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n### King's Buildings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: King's Buildings\n\n![](image)Royal Observatory, Edinburgh\nThe King's Buildings campus is located in the south of the city. Most of the Science and Engineering College's research and teaching activities take place at the campus, which occupies a 35-hectare site. It includes the Alexander Graham Bell Building (for mobile phones and digital communications systems), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and School of Mathematics), Joseph Black Building (home to the School of Chemistry), Royal Observatory, Swann Building (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology), Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment), and others.[128] Until 2012, the KB campus was served by three libraries: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library, and Robertson Engineering and Science Library. These were replaced by the Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the academic year 2012/13.[129][130] The campus also hosts the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), and Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).\n\n\n\n### BioQuarter[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh BioQuarter\n\n![](image)Edinburgh BioQuarter\nThe BioQuarter campus, based in the Little France area, is home to the majority of medical facilities of the university, alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The campus houses the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chancellor's Building, Euan MacDonald Centre, and Queen's Medical Research Institute, which opened in 2005.[79] The Chancellor's Building has two large lecture theatres and a medical library connected to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by a series of corridors.\n\n\n\n### Easter Bush[edit]\n\n\nThe Easter Bush campus, located seven miles south of the city, houses the Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education, Roslin Institute, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, and Veterinary Oncology and Imaging Centre.[91]\n\n\nThe Roslin Institute is an animal sciences research institute which is sponsored by BBSRC.[131] The Institute won international fame in 1996, when its researchers Sir Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and their colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.[132][133] A year later Polly and Molly were cloned, both sheep contained a human gene.[134]\n\n\n\n### Western General[edit]\n\n\nThe Western General campus, in proximity to the Western General Hospital, contains the Biomedical Research Facility, Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, and Institute of Genetics and Cancer (formerly the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine).\n\n\n\n* Modern architecture at the University of Edinburgh\n* ![Appleton Tower](image)\n\nAppleton Tower\n* ![Business School](image)\n\nBusiness School\n* ![Centre for Regenerative Medicine](image)\n\nCentre for Regenerative Medicine\n* ![Erskine Williamson Building, King's Buildings](image)\n\nErskine Williamson Building, King's Buildings\n* ![Informatics Forum, School of Informatics](image)\n\nInformatics Forum, School of Informatics\n* ![Roslin Institute](image)\n\nRoslin Institute\n* ![Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, School of Medicine](image)\n\nRoyal Infirmary of Edinburgh, School of Medicine\n* ![Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies](image)\n\nRoyal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ancient university governance in Scotland\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966. These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the *Senatus Academicus*.[46]\n\n\n\n#### University Court[edit]\n\n\nThe University Court is the university's governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and *Senatus Academicus*. By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court.[135] The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university's revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.\n\n\n\n#### General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement.[136] The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n\n#### *Senatus Academicus*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Senatus Academicus* is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff.[137] The core function of the *Senatus* is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The *Senatus* elects four Assessors on the University Court. The *Senatus* meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n\n#### University officials[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, Rector of the University of Edinburgh, and List of Principals of the University of Edinburgh\n\n![](image)\nPrincess Anne, current Chancellor\n![](image)\nDebora Kayembe, current Lord Rector\n![](image)\nSir Peter Mathieson, current Principal and Vice-Chancellor\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\n\n\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels.[138] The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie.[138] Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip.[16] She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\n\n\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court.[139] The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is human rights lawyer Debora Kayembe, who has held the position since March 2021.[139][140]\n\n\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role.[141] The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the *Senatus Academicus* and a member of the University Court *ex officio*.[141] The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.[142]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and schools[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'.[143] While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.[144]\n\n\n\n#### Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Department of Psychology building at 7 George Square\n![](image)Elsie Inglis Quad at the Old Medical School, currently hosting the School of History, Classics and Archaeology\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011.[145] CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes.[146][147] Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 *Complete University Guide*.[148] It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain,[35] which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 *QS Rankings by Subject* in English Language & Literature.[149] The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.[150][5]\n\n\n\n* Business School\n* Edinburgh College of Art\n* Moray House School of Education and Sport\n* School of Divinity\n* School of Economics\n* School of Health in Social Science\n* School of History, Classics and Archaeology\n* School of Law\n* School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures\n* School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences\n* School of Social and Political Science\n* Centre for Open Learning\n* Edinburgh Futures Institute\n\n#### Medicine and Veterinary Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Edinburgh College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine\n\n![](image)Members of the medical faculty at Edinburgh in the first half of the 19th century. *Seated* (L–R): J.

Traill.\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university's international reputation.[151][152] Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\n\n\nIn the 21st century, the medical school has continued to excel, and it is associated with 13 Nobel Prize recipients: seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and six of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[153] In 2021, it was ranked third in the UK by The Times University Guide,[154] and the Complete University Guide. In 2022, it was ranked the UK's best medical school by the Guardian University Guide,[155] It also ranked 21st in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings in 2021.[156]\n\n\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice. The eight original faculties formed four Faculty Groups in August 1992. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff.[150][5] The university's teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John's Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.[157][158][159]\n\n\n\n#### Science and Engineering[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Edinburgh College of Science and Engineering\n\n![](image)Old Surgical Hospital in Drummond Street, once part of the Royal Infirmary, today houses the university's Institute of Geography.\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as \"natural philosophy\" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh's professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world's first Chemical Society in 1785.[160] The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh.[160] The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering. The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff.[150][5]\n\n\n\n* School of Biological Sciences\n* School of Chemistry\n* School of Engineering\n* School of GeoSciences\n* School of Informatics\n* School of Mathematics\n* School of Physics and Astronomy\n\n#### Sub-units, centres and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh Futures Institute taking shape on the former site of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows:[161]\n\n\n\n* Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI)\n* Bayes Centre\n* Centre for the History of the Book (CHB)\n* Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM)\n* Centre for the Study of World Christianity (CSWC)\n* Centre for Theology and Public Issues (CTPI)\n* Digital Curation Centre (DCC)\n* Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC)\n* Edinburgh Dental Institute (EDI)\n* Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI)\n* Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC)\n* Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (ESALA)\n* Euan MacDonald Centre\n* Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics\n* Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH)\n* International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS)\n* Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation (ISSTI)\n* Koestler Parapsychology Unit\n* Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS)\n* MRC Human Genetics Unit (MRC HGU)\n* MRC Centre for Inflammation Research\n* Nursing Studies\n* Roslin Institute\n* Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre\n* Scottish Studies\n* UK Centre for Astrobiology (UKCA)\n* Usher Institute\n\n### Staff, Community and Networking[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2023, the University employed over 11,800 full time equivalent staff:[162]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences | 2,804\n |\n| College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine | 2,868\n |\n| College of Science & Engineering | 2,709\n |\n| Corporate Services Group\n | 2,145\n |\n| Information Services Group\n | 685\n |\n| University Secretaries Group\n | 674\n |\n| **University of Edinburgh Total:** | **11,885**\n |\n\n\nAs part of the university's support for researchers,[163] each College has Research Staff Societies that include postdoc societies, and organisations specific to each school.[164] Cross-curricula Research Networks bring together researchers working on similar topics.[165]\n\n\nIndependently of the College hierarchy, aligned with the university's EDI policy, seven Staff Networks bring together and represent diverse staff groups:[166]\n\n\n\n1.

A Marking and Assessment Boycott[176] that commenced on 20 April 2023[177] was called off on 6 September 2023.[178] However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September.[179][180]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the *Sutton 13* group of top-ranked universities in the UK.[181] It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities.[182] The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research. Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn.[183][184]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics[14]\n|  | 2022\n | 2021\n | 2020\n | 2019\n | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 75,438\n | 68,954\n | 62,220\n | 60,983\n | 58,411\n |\n| **Offers** | 25,210\n | 32,432\n | 31,510\n | 27,878\n | 25,532\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 33.0\n | 47.0\n | 50.6\n | 45.7\n | 43.7\n |\n| **Enrolls** | 6,111\n | 8,083\n | 7,344\n | 6,346\n | 6,221\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 24.2\n | 24.9\n | 23.3\n | 22.8\n | 24.4\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 12.34\n | 8.53\n | 8.47\n | 9.61\n | 9.39\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[15] | —\n | 197\n | 190\n | 186\n | 187\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[185] and Ethnicity[186] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[c] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[187][188] |\n| Female | 61%\n | 61 |\n| Private School | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Low Participation Areas[d] | 9%\n | 9 |\n\n\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades.[15] It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group.[189]\n\n\nIn 2022, excluding courses within Edinburgh College of Art, the most competitive courses for Scottish applicants were Oral Health Science (9%), Business (11%), Philosophy & Psychology (14%), Social Work (15%), and International Business (15%).[190] For students from the rest of the UK, the most competitive courses were Nursing (5%), Medicine (6%), Veterinary Medicine (6%), Psychology (8%), and Politics, Philosophy and Economics (10%).[191] For international students, the most competitive courses were Medicine (5%), Nursing (7%), Business (11%), Politics, Philosophy and\nEconomics (12%), and Sociology (13%).[192]\n\n\nFor the academic year 2019/20, 36.8% of Edinburgh's new undergraduates were privately educated, the second-highest proportion among mainstream British universities, behind only Oxford.[193] As of August 2021, it has a higher proportion of female than male students with a male to female ratio of 38:62 in the undergraduate population, and the undergraduate student body is composed of 30% Scottish students, 32% from the rest of the UK, 10% from the EU, and 28% from outside the EU.[5]\n\n\n\n### Graduation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Edinburgh\n\n![](image)Edinburgh graduation ceremony in the McEwan Hall\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being 'capped' with the *Geneva bonnet*, which involves the university's principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate.[194] The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan.[195] However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat.[194][196] In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the *Geneva bonnet*.[197]\n\n\n\n### Library system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh University Library\n\n![](image)Playfair Library Hall in Old College\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland.[198][199] The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence. At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building.[200] The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level.[201]\n\n\n\n### Exchange programmes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The former principal Sir Timothy O'Shea signed an agreement with Peking University in 2012.\nThe university offers students the opportunity to study in Europe and beyond via the European Union's Erasmus+ programme[e] and a variety of international exchange agreements with around 300 partners institutions in nearly 40 countries worldwide.[203]\n\n\nUniversity-wide exchanges are open to almost any student whose degree permits a year abroad and who can find a suitable course combination. The list of partner institutions is shown as follows (part of):[204]\n\n\n\n* **Asia-Pacific**: Fudan University, University of Hong Kong, University of Melbourne, Seoul National University,

Research Excellence Framework (REF), which evaluated work produced between 2014 and 2021, Edinburgh ranked 4th by research power and 15th by GPA amongst British universities.[212] The university fell four places in GPA when compared to the 2014 REF, but retained its place in research power.[213] 90 per cent of the university's research activity was judged to be 'world leading' (4\\*) or 'internationally excellent' (3\\*), and five departments – Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies – were ranked as the best in the UK.[214]\n\n\nIn the 2015 *THE Global Employability University Ranking*, Edinburgh ranked 23rd in the world and 4th in the UK for graduate employability as voted by international recruiters.[215] A 2015 government report found that Edinburgh was one of only two Scottish universities (along with St Andrews) that some London-based elite recruitment firms considered applicants from, especially in the field of financial services and investment banking.[216] When *The New York Times* ranked universities based on the employability of graduates as evaluated by recruiters from top companies in 20 countries in 2012, Edinburgh was placed at 42nd in the world and 7th in Britain.[217]\n\n\nEdinburgh was ranked 24th in the world and 5th in the UK by the 2021 *Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities*, a league table based on the three major world university rankings, *ARWU*, *QS* and *THE*.[218] In the 2022 *U.S. News & World Report*, Edinburgh ranked 32nd globally and 5th nationally.[219] The 2022 *World Reputation Rankings* placed Edinburgh at 32nd worldwide and 5th nationwide.[220] In 2023, it ranked 73rd amongst the universities around the world by the *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[221]\n\n\nThe disparity between Edinburgh's research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely due to the impact of measures of 'student satisfaction'.[222] Edinburgh was ranked last in the UK for teaching quality in the 2012 National Student Survey,[223] with the 2015 *Good University Guide* stating that this stemmed from \"questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback\", and that the university \"still has a long way to go to turn around a poor position\".[224] Edinburgh improved only marginally over the next years, with the 2021 *Good University Guide* still ranking it in the bottom 10 domestically in both teaching quality and student experience.[225] Edinburgh was ranked 122nd out of 128 universities for student satisfaction in the 2022 *Complete University Guide*, although it was ranked 12th overall.[226] The 2024 *Guardian University Guide* ranked Edinburgh 14th overall, but 50th out of 120 universities in teaching satisfaction, and lowest among all universities in satisfaction with feedback.[227]\n\n\nIn the 2022 *Complete University Guide*, 32 out of the 49 subjects offered by Edinburgh were ranked within the top 10 in the UK, with Asian Studies (4th), Chemical Engineering (4th), Education (2nd), Geology (5th), Linguistics (5th), Mechanical Engineering (5th), Medicine (5th), Music (5th), Nursing (1st), Physics & Astronomy (5th), Social Policy (5th), Theology & Religious Studies (4th), and Veterinary Medicine (2nd) within the top 5.[226] The 2021 *THE World University Rankings by Subject* ranked Edinburgh 10th worldwide in Arts and Humanities, 15th in Law, 16th in Psychology, 21st in Clinical, Pre-clinical & Health, 22nd in Computer Science, 28th in Education, 28th in Life Science, 43rd in Business & Economics, 44th in Social Sciences, 45th in Physical Sciences, and 86th in Engineering & Technology.[228] The 2023 *QS World University Rankings by Subject* placed Edinburgh at 10th globally in Arts & Humanities, 23rd in Life Sciences & Medicine, 36th in Natural Sciences, 50th in Social Sciences & Management, and 59th in Engineering & Technology.[229] According to *CSRankings*, computer science at Edinburgh was ranked 1st in the UK and 36th globally, and Edinburgh was the best in natural language processing (NLP) in the world.[230]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students' Association[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh University Students' Association\n\n![](image)The Pleasance, one of EUSA's main buildings, is a theatre, bar, sports and recreation complex.\nEdinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) consists of the students' union and the students' representative council. EUSA's buildings include Teviot Row House, The Pleasance, Potterrow Student Centre, Kings Buildings House, as well as shops, cafés and refectories across the various campuses. Teviot Row House is considered the oldest purpose-built student union building in the world.[59][231] Most of these buildings are operated as Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues during August. EUSA represents students to the university and the wider world, and is responsible for over 250 student societies at the university. The association has five sabbatical office bearers – a president and four vice presidents. EUSA is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS).\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nAmateur dramatic societies benefit from Edinburgh being an important cultural hub for comedy, amateur and fringe theatre throughout the UK, most prominently through the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh University Music Society, performing Mahler in Greyfriars Kirk\nThe Edinburgh University Music Society (EUMS) is a student-run musical organisation, which is Scotland's oldest student's musical society; it can be traced back to a concert in February 1867.[233] It performs three concert series throughout the year whilst also undertaking a programme of charity events and education projects.[234]\n\n\n\n![](image)The student-run Bedlam Theatre, home to the Edinburgh University Theatre Company\nThe Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC), founded in 1890 as the Edinburgh University Drama Society, is known for running Bedlam Theatre, the oldest student-run theatre in Britain and venue for the Fringe.[235][236] EUTC also funds acclaimed improvisational comedy troupe The Improverts during term time and the Fringe.[237][238] Alumni include Sir Michael Boyd, Ian Charleson, Kevin McKidd, and Greg Wise.\n\n\nThe Edinburgh Studio Opera (formerly Edinburgh University Opera Club) is a student opera company in Edinburgh. It performs at least one fully staged opera each year.[239] The Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group (EUSOG) is an opera and musical theatre company founded by students in 1961 to promote and perform the comic operettas of Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, collectively known as Savoy Operas after the theatre in which they were originally staged.[240]\n\n\nThe Edinburgh University Footlights are a musical theatre company founded in 1989 and produce two large scale shows a year.[241][242] One of the founders is the Theatre Producer Colin Ingram.[243] Theatre Parodok, founded in 2004, is a student theatre company that aims to produce shows that are \"experimental without being exclusive\". They stage one large show each semester and one for the festival.[244]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n*The Student* is a fortnightly student newspaper. Founded in 1887 by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, it is the oldest student newspaper in the United Kingdom.[245] Former writers of the newspaper include politicians Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, and Lord Steel of Aikwood.[246][247] It has been independent of the university since 1992, but was forced to temporarily fold in 2002 due to increasing debts. The newspaper won a number of student newspaper awards in the years following its relaunch.[245]\n\n\n*The Journal* was an independent publication, established in 2007 by three students and former writers for *The Student.* It was also distributed to other higher education institutions in the city, such as Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh Napier University, and Telford College. It was the largest such publication in Scotland, with a print run of 10,000 copies. Despite winning a number of awards for its journalism, the magazine folded in 2015 due to financial difficulties.[248]\n\n\nFreshAir, launched on 3 October 1992, is an alternative music student radio station. The station is one of the oldest surviving student radio stations in the UK, and won the \"Student Radio Station of the Year\" award at the annual Student Radio Awards in 2004.[249]\n\n\nIn September 2015, the Edinburgh University Student Television (EUTV) became the newest addition to the student media scene at the university, producing a regular magazine-style programme, documentaries and other special events.[250]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh University Sports Union\n\n![](image)Edinburgh University Mountaineering Club at the cairn on Ciste Dhubh, 1964\nStudent sport at Edinburgh consists of clubs covering the more traditional rugby, football, rowing and judo, to the more unconventional korfball, gliding and mountaineering. In 2021, the university had over 65 sports clubs run by Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU).[251]\n\n\nThe Scottish Varsity, known as the \"world's oldest varsity match\", is a rugby match played annually against the University of St Andrews dating back over 150 years.[252] Discontinued in the 1950s, the match was resurrected in 2011 and was staged in London at the home of London Scottish RFC. It is played at the beginning of the academic year, and since 2015 has been staged at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.[253]\n\n\nThe Scottish Boat Race is an annual rowing race between the Glasgow University Boat Club and the Edinburgh University Boat Club, rowed between competing eights on the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Started in 1877, it is believed to be the third-oldest university boat race in the world, predated by the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and the Harvard–Yale Regatta.[254]\n\n\nEdinburgh athletes have repeatedly been successful at the Olympic Games: Sprinter Eric Liddell won gold and bronze at the 1924 Summer Olympics. At the 1948 Summer Olympics, alumnus Jackie Robinson won a gold medal with the American Basketball team. Trap shooter Bob Braithwaite secured a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Cyclist Sir Chris Hoy won six gold and one silver medal between 2000 and 2012. Rower Dame Katherine Grainger won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and four further silver medals between 2000 and 2016. Edinburgh was the most successful UK university at the 2012 Games with two gold medals from Hoy and one from Grainger.[255]\n\n\n\n### Student activism[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of campaigning societies at the university. The largest of these include the environment and poverty campaigning group People & Planet and Amnesty International Society. International development organisations include Edinburgh Global Partnerships, which was established as a student-led charity in 1990.[256] There is also a significant left-wing presence on campus,[257] including an anti-austerity group, Edinburgh University Anarchist Society, Edinburgh University Socialist Society, Edinburgh Young Greens, Feminist Society, LGBT+ Pride,[258] Marxist Society, and Students for Justice in Palestine.[259]\n\n\nProtests, demonstrations and occupations are regular occurrences at the university.[260][261][262] The activist group People & Planet took over Charles Stewart House in 2015 and again in 2016 in protest over the university's investment in companies active in arms manufacturing or fossil fuel extraction.[263][264] In May 2015, a security guard was charged in relation to the occupations.[265]\n\n\n\n### Student co-operatives[edit]\n\n\nThere are three student-run co-operatives associated with the University: Edinburgh Student Housing Co-operative (ESHC), providing affordable housing for 106 students;[266] the Hearty Squirrel Food Cooperative, providing local, organic and affordable food to students and staff;[267] and the SHRUB Coop, a swap and re-use hub aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainability.[268] Of these, only the Hearty Squirrel Co-operative operates on campus. ESHC is based on the Bruntsfield Links south of the University's central campus, and hosts students from all three city universities and Edinburgh College. The SHRUB co-operative was formed partly by University of Edinburgh students but is now run by interested members from across Edinburgh. The co-operatives form part of the Students for Cooperation network.[269]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Edinburgh people and List of University of Edinburgh medical people\n\nThe university is associated with some of the most significant intellectual and scientific contributions in human history, which include: the foundation of Antiseptic surgery (Joseph Lister),[270] Bayesian statistics (Thomas Bayes),[271] Economics (Adam Smith),[272] Electromagnetism (James Clerk Maxwell),[273] Evolution (Charles Darwin),[274][275] Knot theory (Peter Guthrie Tait),[276] modern Geology (James Hutton),[277] Nephrology (Richard Bright),[278] Endocrinology (Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer),[279] Hematology (William Hewson),[280] Dermatology (Robert Willan),[281] Epigenetics (C.

Scenes were filmed at the old School of Anatomy.[387]\n* Many of Arthur Conan Doyle's works drew inspiration from his mentors at the university. Joseph Bell, a lecturer and surgeon famous for drawing conclusions from minute observations, became the archetype for Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. William Rutherford, Conan Doyle's physiology professor provided the template for Professor Challenger, the protagonist of his science fiction work *The Lost World* (1912). Edinburgh is also Challenger's *alma mater* in the books.\n* Dr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that \"I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ's College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me 'Doctor'.\"[g] In 2010, Fu Manchu's connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.[388][389]\n* In the movie *Journey to the Center of the Earth* (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne's novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.[390]\n* The historical film *Chariots of Fire* (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College.[391] Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\n* In the novel *The Last King of Scotland* (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\n* In the American television show *NCIS* (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show's main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.[392]\n* In the novel *One Day* (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled *One Day* and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university.[393] A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.[394]\n* The BBC legal drama *Garrow's Law* (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London. Old College and the Playfair Library are prominently featured.[395]\n* The thriller television series *Clique* (2017–2019) produced by BBC Three focuses on two students at the university. The series was shot largely on location in Edinburgh, including The Meadows, Old College, and Potterrow.[396][397]\n* *Fast & Furious 9* (2021), partly set in Edinburgh, featured scenes in and around Old College filmed in September 2019.[398]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Edinburgh portal\n* ![flag](image)Scotland portal\n\n\n* Academic dress of the University of Edinburgh\n* Armorial of UK universities\n* Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh\n* Edinburgh University Press\n* Edinburgh University Settlement\n* Epistemics, a term for cognitive science coined in 1969 by the University of Edinburgh\n* Gifford Lectures\n* James Tait Black Memorial Prize\n* List of early modern universities in Europe\n* List of organisations with a British royal charter\n* List of professorships at the University of Edinburgh\n* List of universities in the United Kingdom\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** HESA numbers given here are significantly lower than those reported by the university, since HESA does not include non-graduating and visiting students, postgraduates writing up, and online learning students living abroad.[5]\n2. **^** Liddell (1), Robinson (1), Braithwaite (1), Hoy (6), Grainger (1)\n3. **^** Includes those who indicate in their UCAS application that they identify as Asian, Black, Mixed Heritage, Arab or any other ethnicity except White.\n4. **^** Calculated from the Polar4 measure, using Quintile1, in England and Wales.

Founded by the town council under the authority of a royal charter of King James VI in 1582 and officially opened in 1583, it is one of Scotland's four ancient universities and the sixth-oldest university in continuous operation in the English-speaking world.[1] The university played an important role in Edinburgh becoming a chief intellectual centre during the Scottish Enlightenment and contributed to the city being nicknamed the \"Athens of the North.\"[7][8]\n\n\nEdinburgh is ranked 22nd in the world by the QS World University Rankings,[9] 30th by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings,[10] and 38th by the Academic Ranking of World Universities.[11] It is a member of several associations of research-intensive universities, including the Coimbra Group, League of European Research Universities, Russell Group, Una Europa, and Universitas 21.[12] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, it had a total income of £1.262 billion, of which £331.6 million was from research grants and contracts. It has the third-largest endowment in the UK, behind only Cambridge and Oxford.[2] The university occupies five main campuses in the city of Edinburgh, which include many buildings of historical and architectural significance such as those in the Old Town.[13]\n\n\nEdinburgh is the seventh-largest university in the UK by enrolment[4] and receives over 75,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the second-most popular university in the UK by volume of applications.[14] Edinburgh had the eighth-highest average UCAS points amongst British universities for new entrants in 2020.[15] The university continues to have links to the royal family, having had Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh as its chancellor from 1953 to 2010 and Anne, Princess Royal since March 2011.[16]\n\n\nAlumni of the university include inventor Alexander Graham Bell, naturalist Charles Darwin, philosopher David Hume, physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and writers such as Sir J. M. Barrie, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, J. K. Rowling, Sir Walter Scott, and Robert Louis Stevenson.[17][18] The university counts several heads of state and government amongst its graduates, including three British Prime Ministers. Three Supreme Court Justices of the UK were educated at Edinburgh. As of January 2023[update], 19 Nobel Prize laureates, four Pulitzer Prize winners, three Turing Award winners, and an Abel Prize laureate and Fields Medalist have been affiliated with Edinburgh as alumni or academic staff.[19] Edinburgh alumni have won a total of ten Olympic gold medals.[b]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Rollock, Regent (1583–1586) and first principal (1586–1599) of the University of Edinburgh\nIn 1557, Bishop Robert Reid of St Magnus Cathedral on Orkney made a will containing an endowment of 8,000 merks to build a college in Edinburgh.[20] Unusually for his time, Reid's vision included the teaching of rhetoric and poetry, alongside more traditional subjects such as philosophy.[20] However, the bequest was delayed by more than 25 years due to the religious revolution that led to the Reformation Parliament of 1560.[20] The plans were revived in the late 1570s through efforts by the Edinburgh Town Council, first minister of Edinburgh James Lawson, and Lord Provost William Little.[1] When Reid's descendants were unwilling to pay out the sum, the town council petitioned King James VI and his Privy Council. The King brokered a monetary compromise and granted a royal charter on 14 April 1582, empowering the town council to create a college of higher education.[20][21][22] A college established by secular authorities was unprecedented in newly Presbyterian Scotland, as all previous Scottish universities had been founded through papal bulls.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Main buildings of King James' College in 1647, lying in a double courtyard on the lower left\n![](image)Frontispiece to earliest laureation (graduation) register (1587)\nNamed *Tounis College* (Town's College), the university opened its doors to students on 14 October 1583, with an attendance of 80–90.[1] At the time, the college mainly covered liberal arts and divinity.[24][25] Instruction began under the charge of a graduate from the University of St Andrews, theologian Robert Rollock, who first served as Regent, and from 1586 as principal of the college.[26] Initially Rollock was the sole instructor for first-year students, and he was expected to tutor the 1583 intake for all four years of their degree in every subject. The first cohort finished their studies in 1587, and 47 students graduated (or 'laureated') with an M.A. degree.[26] When King James VI visited Scotland in 1617, he held a disputation with the college's professors, after which he decreed that it should henceforth be called the \"Colledge *[sic]* of King James\".[27][28] The university was known as both *Tounis College* and *King James' College* until it gradually assumed the name of the University of Edinburgh during the 17th century.[24][29]\n\n\nAfter the deposition of King James II and VII during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Parliament of Scotland passed legislation designed to root out Jacobite sympathisers amongst university staff.[30] In Edinburgh, this led to the dismissal of Principal Alexander Monro and several professors and regents after a government visitation in 1690. The university was subsequently led by Principal Gilbert Rule, one of the inquisitors on the visitation committee.[30]\n\n\n\n### 18th and 19th century[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"You are now in a place where the best courses upon earth are within your reach... Such an opportunity you will never again have. I would therefore strongly press on you to fix no other limit to your stay in Edinborough than your having got thro this whole course. The omission of any one part of it will be an affliction & loss to you as long as you live.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas Jefferson, writing to his son-in-law Thomas Mann Randolph, Jr. in 1786.[31]\n\nThe late 17th and early 18th centuries were marked by a power struggle between the university and town council, which had ultimate authority over staff appointments, curricula, and examinations.[32] After a series of challenges by the university, the conflict culminated in the council seizing the college records in 1704.[32] Relations were only gradually repaired over the next 150 years and suffered repeated setbacks.\n\n\nThe university expanded by founding a Faculty of Law in 1707, a Faculty of Arts in 1708, and a Faculty of Medicine in 1726.[33] In 1762, Reverend Hugh Blair was appointed by King George III as the first Regius Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres.[34] This formalised literature as a subject and marks the foundation of the English Literature department, making Edinburgh the oldest centre of literary education in Britain.[35]\n\n\nDuring the 18th century, the university was at the centre of the Scottish Enlightenment.[36] The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment fell on especially fertile ground in Edinburgh because of the university's democratic and secular origin; its organization as a single entity instead of loosely connected colleges, which encouraged academic exchange; its adoption of the more flexible Dutch model of professorship, rather than having student cohorts taught by a single regent; and the lack of land endowments as its source of income, which meant its faculty operated in a more competitive environment.[37] Between 1750 and 1800, this system produced and attracted key Enlightenment figures such as chemist Joseph Black, economist Adam Smith, historian William Robertson, philosophers David Hume and Dugald Stewart, physician William Cullen, and early sociologist Adam Ferguson, many of which taught concurrently.[37] By the time the Royal Society of Edinburgh was founded in 1783, the university was regarded as one of the world's preeminent scientific institutions,[38] and Voltaire called Edinburgh a \"hotbed of genius\" as a result.[39] Benjamin Franklin believed that the university possessed \"a set of as truly great men, Professors of the Several Branches of Knowledge, as have ever appeared in any Age or Country\".[40] Thomas Jefferson felt that as far as science was concerned, \"no place in the world can pretend to a competition with Edinburgh\".[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)The east facade of Old College facing onto South Bridge, as built in 1827. A dome similar to Adam's original design was added in 1887 by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson.\n![piece of parchment of charter of novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582](image)A Charter of Novodamus from King James VI of Scotland in 1582, to establish a college\nIn 1785, Henry Dundas introduced the South Bridge Act in the House of Commons; one of the bill's goals was to use South Bridge as a location for the university, which had existed in a hotchpotch of buildings since its establishment. The site was used to construct Old College, the university's first custom-built building, by architect William Henry Playfair to plans by Robert Adam.[42] During the 18th century, the university developed a particular forte in teaching anatomy and the developing science of surgery, and it was considered one of the best medical schools in the English-speaking world.[43] Bodies to be used for dissection were brought to the university's Anatomy Theatre through a secret tunnel from a nearby house (today's College Wynd student accommodation), which was also used by murderers Burke and Hare to deliver the corpses of their victims during the 1820s.[44][45]\n\n\nAfter 275 years of governance by the town council, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858 gave the university full authority over its own affairs.[32] The act established governing bodies including a university court and a general council, and redefined the roles of key officials like the chancellor, rector, and principal.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque commemorating the Edinburgh Seven at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh\nThe Edinburgh Seven were the first group of matriculated undergraduate female students at any British university.[47] Led by Sophia Jex-Blake, they began studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh in 1869. Although the university blocked them from graduating and qualifying as doctors, their campaign gained national attention and won them many supporters, including Charles Darwin.[48] Their efforts put the rights of women to higher education on the national political agenda, which eventually resulted in legislation allowing women to study at all Scottish universities in 1889. The university admitted women to graduate in medicine in 1893.[49][50] In 2015, the Edinburgh Seven were commemorated with a plaque at the university,[51] and in 2019 they were posthumously awarded with medical degrees.[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buildings of the Old Medical School at Teviot Place, photographed in the late 19th century\n![](image)Exterior of the McEwan Hall\nTowards the end of the 19th century, Old College was becoming overcrowded. After a bequest from Sir David Baxter, the university started planning new buildings in earnest. Sir Robert Rowand Anderson won the public architectural competition and was commissioned to design new premises for the Medical School in 1877.[53] Initially, the design incorporated a campanile and a hall for examination and graduation, but this was seen as too ambitious. The new Medical School opened in 1884, but the building was not completed until 1888.[54] After funds were donated by politician and brewer William McEwan in 1894, a separate graduation building was constructed after all, also designed by Anderson.[55] The resulting McEwan Hall on Bristo Square was presented to the university in 1897.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Teviot Row House, drawn by architect Sydney Mitchell in 1888\nThe Students' Representative Council (SRC) was founded in 1884 by student Robert Fitzroy Bell.[57][58] In 1889, the SRC voted to establish Edinburgh University Union (EUU), to be housed in Teviot Row House on Bristo Square.[59] Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU) was founded in 1866, and Edinburgh University Women's Union (renamed the Chambers Street Union in 1964) in October 1905.[60] The SRC, EUU and Chambers Street Union merged to form Edinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) on 1 July 1973.[61][62]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, the Science and Medicine buildings had suffered from a lack of repairs or upgrades, which was exacerbated by an influx of students after the end of the war.[63] In 1919, the university bought the land of West Mains Farm in the south of the city for the development of a new satellite campus specialising in the sciences.[64] On 6 July 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the first new building (now called the Joseph Black Building), housing the Department of Chemistry.[63] The campus was named King's Buildings in honour of George V.\n\n\n\n![](image)Facade of New College facing onto The Mound in 1910\nNew College on The Mound was originally opened in 1846 as a Free Church of Scotland college, later of the United Free Church of Scotland.[65] Since the 1930s it has been the home of the School of Divinity. Prior to the 1929 reunion of the Church of Scotland, candidates for the ministry in the United Free Church studied at New College, whilst candidates for the Church of Scotland studied in the university's Faculty of Divinity.[66] In 1935 the two institutions merged, with all operations moved to the New College site in Old Town.[67] This freed up Old College for Edinburgh Law School.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque honouring the Polish School of Medicine at the old Medical School\nThe Polish School of Medicine was established in 1941 as a wartime academic initiative. While it was originally intended for students and doctors in the Polish Armed Forces in the West, civilians were also allowed to take the courses, which were taught in Polish and awarded Polish medical degrees.[69] When the school was closed in 1949, 336 students had matriculated, of which 227 students graduated with the equivalent of an MBChB and a total of 19 doctors obtained a doctorate or MD.[70] A bronze plaque commemorating the Polish School of Medicine is located in the Quadrangle of the old Medical School in Teviot Place.[71]\n\n\nOn 10 May 1951, the *Royal (Dick) Veterinary College*, founded in 1823 by William Dick,[72] was reconstituted as the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and officially became part of the university.[73] It achieved full faculty status as Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1964.\n\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, there were around 7,000 students matriculating annually, more than doubling the numbers from the turn of the century.[74] The university addressed this partially through the redevelopment of George Square, demolishing much of the area's historic houses and erecting modern buildings such as 40 George Square, Appleton Tower and the Main Library.[75]\n\n\nOn 1 August 1998, the *Moray House Institute of Education*, founded in 1848, merged with the University of Edinburgh, becoming its Faculty of Education. Following the internal restructuring of the university in 2002, Moray House became known as the Moray House School of Education.[76] It was renamed the Moray House School of Education and Sport in August 2019.[77]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s it became apparent that the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place were no longer adequate for a modern teaching hospital. Donald Dewar, the Scottish Secretary at the time, authorized a joint project between private finance, local authorities, and the university to create a modern hospital and medical campus in the Little France area of Edinburgh.[78] The new campus was named the BioQuarter. The Chancellor's Building was opened on 12 August 2002 by Prince Philip, housing the new Edinburgh Medical School alongside the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.[79] In 2007, the campus saw the addition of the Euan MacDonald Centre as a research centre for motor neuron diseases, which was part-funded by Scottish entrepreneur Euan MacDonald and his father Donald.[80][81] In August 2010, author J. K. Rowling provided £10 million in funding to create the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic,[82] which was officially opened in October 2013.[83] The Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM) is a stem cell research centre dedicated to the development of regenerative treatments, which was opened in 2012.[84] CRM is also home to applied scientists working with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) and Roslin Cells.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Atrium of the Informatics Forum\nIn December 2002, the Edinburgh Cowgate Fire destroyed a number of university buildings, including some 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) of the School of Informatics at 80 South Bridge.[86][87] This was replaced with the Informatics Forum on Bristo Square, completed in July 2008. Also in 2002, the Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC) was opened on the Western General Hospital site.[88] In 2007, the MRC Human Genetics Unit formed a partnership with the Centre for Genomic & Experimental Medicine and the ECRC to create the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (renamed the Institute of Genetics and Cancer in 2021) on the same site.[89]\n\n\nIn April 2008, the Roslin Institute – an animal sciences research centre known for cloning Dolly the sheep – became part of the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.[90] In 2011, the school moved into a new £60 million building on the Easter Bush campus, which now houses research and teaching facilities, and a hospital for small and farm animals.[91][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh College of Art\nEdinburgh College of Art, founded in 1760, formally merged with the university's School of Arts, Culture and Environment on 1 August 2011.[93][94] In 2014, the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE) was founded as an international joint institute offering degrees in biomedical sciences, taught in English.[95] The campus, located in Haining, Zhejiang Province, China, was established on 15 March 2016.[96]\n\n\nThe university began hosting a Wikimedian in Residence in 2016.[97] The residency was made into a full-time position in 2019, with the Wikimedian involved in teaching and learning activities within the scope of the University of Edinburgh WikiProject.[98]\n\n\nIn 2018, the University of Edinburgh was a signatory to the £1.3 billion *Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal*, in partnership with the UK and Scottish governments, six local authorities and all universities and colleges in the region.[99] The university committed to delivering a range of economic benefits to the region through the *Data-Driven Innovation* initiative.[100] In conjunction with Heriot-Watt University, the deal created five innovation hubs: the Bayes Centre, Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI), Usher Institute, Easter Bush, and one further hub based at Heriot-Watt, the National Robotarium. The deal also included creation of the Edinburgh International Data Facility, which performs high-speed data processing in a secure environment.[101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the university completed work on the *Richard Verney Health Centre* at its central area campus on Bristo Square. The facility houses a health centre and pharmacy, and the university's disability and counselling services.[103] The university's largest current expansion project is the conversion of some of the historic Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh buildings in Lauriston Place, which had been vacated in 2003 and partially developed into the Quartermile. The £120 million renovations and extension will provide space for the *Edinburgh Futures Institute*, an interdisciplinary hub linking arts, humanities, and social sciences with other disciplines in the research and teaching of 'complex futures'.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Historical links[edit]\n\n\nEdinburgh has a number of historical links to other universities, chiefly through its influential Medical School and its graduates, who established and developed institutions elsewhere in the world.\n\n\n\n* College of William & Mary: the second-oldest college in the US was founded in 1693 by Edinburgh graduate James Blair, who served as the college's founding president for fifty years.[106]\n* Columbia University: had its Medical School founded by Samuel Bard, an Edinburgh medical graduate.\n* Dalhousie University: Edinburgh alumnus George Ramsay, the 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, wanted to establish a non-denominational college in Halifax open to all.[107] The school was modelled after the University of Edinburgh, which students could attend regardless of religion or nationality.[108]\n* Dartmouth College: had its School of Medicine founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.[109]\n* Harvard University: had its Medical School founded by three surgeons, one of whom was Benjamin Waterhouse, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.[110]\n* McGill University: had its Faculty of Medicine founded by four physicians, which included Edinburgh alumni Andrew Fernando Holmes and John Stephenson.[111][112]\n* University of Pennsylvania: had its School of Medicine founded by Edinburgh graduate John Morgan, who modelled it after Edinburgh Medical School.[113][114]\n* Princeton University: had its academic syllabus and structure reformed along the lines of the University of Edinburgh and other Scottish universities by its sixth president John Witherspoon, an Edinburgh theology graduate.[115][116]\n* University of Sydney: founded in 1850 by Sir Charles Nicholson, a graduate of Edinburgh Medical School.\n* Yale University: had its School of Medicine co-founded by Nathan Smith, an alumnus of Edinburgh Medical School.\n\n\n## Campuses and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![University of Edinburgh is located in Edinburgh](image)![Central Area](image)\nCentral Area\n![King's Buildings](image)\nKing's Buildings\n![BioQuarter](image)\nBioQuarter\n![Western General](image)\nWestern General\n![Holyrood](image)\nHolyrood\n![Pollock Halls](image)\nPollock Halls\n![Easter Bush](image)\nEaster Bush\nclass=notpageimage|\nMain locations of the University of Edinburgh.

It is the university's oldest area, occupied primarily by the College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences and the School of Informatics. The highest concentration of university buildings is around George Square, which includes 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), Appleton Tower, Main Library, and Gordon Aikman Lecture Theatre, the area's largest lecture hall. Around nearby Bristo Square lie the Dugald Stewart Building, Informatics Forum, McEwan Hall, Potterrow Student Centre, Teviot Row House, and old Medical School, which still houses pre-clinical medical courses and biomedical sciences.[45] The Pleasance, one of Edinburgh University Students' Association's main buildings, is located nearby, as is Edinburgh College of Art in Lauriston. North of George Square lies the university's Old College housing Edinburgh Law School, New College on The Mound housing the School of Divinity, and St Cecilia's Hall. Some of these buildings are used to host events during the Edinburgh International Festival and the Edinburgh Festival Fringe every summer.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Pollock Halls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pollock Halls of Residence\n\n![](image)St Leonard's Hall\nPollock Halls, adjoining Holyrood Park to the east, is the university's largest residence hall for undergraduate students in their first year. The complex houses over 2,000 students during term time and consists of ten named buildings with communal green spaces between them.[120] The two original buildings, St Leonard's Hall and Salisbury Green, were built in the 19th century, while the majority of Pollock Halls dates from the 1960s and early 2000s. Two of the older houses in Pollock Halls were demolished in 2002, and a new building, Chancellor's Court, was built in their place and opened in 2003. Self-catered flats elsewhere account for the majority of university-provided accommodation. The area also includes the John McIntyre Conference Centre opened in 2009, which is the university's premier conference space.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Holyrood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Moray House School of Education\n\nThe Holyrood campus, just off the Royal Mile, used to be the site for *Moray House Institute for Education* until it merged with the university on 1 August 1998.[76] The university has since extended this campus.[122] The buildings include redeveloped and extended Sports Science, Physical Education and Leisure Management facilities at St Leonard's Land linked to the Sports Institute in the Pleasance.[123] The £80 million O'Shea Hall at Holyrood was named after the former principal of the university Sir Timothy O'Shea and was opened by Princess Anne in 2017, providing a living and social environment for postgraduate students.[124] The Outreach Centre, Institute for Academic Development (University Services Group), and Edinburgh Centre for Professional Legal Studies are also located at Holyrood.[125][126][127]\n\n\n\n### King's Buildings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: King's Buildings\n\n![](image)Royal Observatory, Edinburgh\nThe King's Buildings campus is located in the south of the city. Most of the Science and Engineering College's research and teaching activities take place at the campus, which occupies a 35-hectare site. It includes the Alexander Graham Bell Building (for mobile phones and digital communications systems), James Clerk Maxwell Building (the administrative and teaching centre of the School of Physics and Astronomy and School of Mathematics), Joseph Black Building (home to the School of Chemistry), Royal Observatory, Swann Building (the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology), Waddington Building (the Centre for Systems Biology at Edinburgh), William Rankine Building (School of Engineering's Institute for Infrastructure and Environment), and others.[128] Until 2012, the KB campus was served by three libraries: Darwin Library, James Clerk Maxwell Library, and Robertson Engineering and Science Library. These were replaced by the Noreen and Kenneth Murray Library opened for the academic year 2012/13.[129][130] The campus also hosts the National e-Science Centre (NeSC), Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), Scottish Institute for Enterprise (SIE), Scottish Microelectronics Centre (SMC), and Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).\n\n\n\n### BioQuarter[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh BioQuarter\n\n![](image)Edinburgh BioQuarter\nThe BioQuarter campus, based in the Little France area, is home to the majority of medical facilities of the university, alongside the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The campus houses the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Chancellor's Building, Euan MacDonald Centre, and Queen's Medical Research Institute, which opened in 2005.[79] The Chancellor's Building has two large lecture theatres and a medical library connected to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by a series of corridors.\n\n\n\n### Easter Bush[edit]\n\n\nThe Easter Bush campus, located seven miles south of the city, houses the Jeanne Marchig International Centre for Animal Welfare Education, Roslin Institute, Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, and Veterinary Oncology and Imaging Centre.[91]\n\n\nThe Roslin Institute is an animal sciences research institute which is sponsored by BBSRC.[131] The Institute won international fame in 1996, when its researchers Sir Ian Wilmut, Keith Campbell and their colleagues created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.[132][133] A year later Polly and Molly were cloned, both sheep contained a human gene.[134]\n\n\n\n### Western General[edit]\n\n\nThe Western General campus, in proximity to the Western General Hospital, contains the Biomedical Research Facility, Edinburgh Clinical Research Facility, and Institute of Genetics and Cancer (formerly the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine).\n\n\n\n* Modern architecture at the University of Edinburgh\n* ![Appleton Tower](image)\n\nAppleton Tower\n* ![Business School](image)\n\nBusiness School\n* ![Centre for Regenerative Medicine](image)\n\nCentre for Regenerative Medicine\n* ![Erskine Williamson Building, King's Buildings](image)\n\nErskine Williamson Building, King's Buildings\n* ![Informatics Forum, School of Informatics](image)\n\nInformatics Forum, School of Informatics\n* ![Roslin Institute](image)\n\nRoslin Institute\n* ![Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, School of Medicine](image)\n\nRoyal Infirmary of Edinburgh, School of Medicine\n* ![Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies](image)\n\nRoyal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ancient university governance in Scotland\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, and in contrast to nearly all other pre-1992 universities which are established by royal charters, the University of Edinburgh is constituted by the Universities (Scotland) Acts 1858 to 1966. These acts provide for three major bodies in the governance of the university: the University Court, the General Council, and the *Senatus Academicus*.[46]\n\n\n\n#### University Court[edit]\n\n\nThe University Court is the university's governing body and the legal person of the university, chaired by the rector and consisting of the principal, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and of Assessors appointed by the rector, chancellor, Edinburgh Town Council, General Council, and *Senatus Academicus*. By the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889, it is a body corporate, with perpetual succession and a common seal. All property belonging to the university at the passing of the Act was vested in the Court.[135] The present powers of the Court are further defined in the Universities (Scotland) Act 1966, including the administration and management of the university's revenue and property, the regulation of staff salaries, and the establishment and composition of committees of its own members or others.\n\n\n\n#### General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe General Council consists of graduates, academic staff, current and former University Court members. It was established to ensure that graduates have a continuing voice in the management of the university. The Council is required to meet twice per year to consider matters affecting the wellbeing and prosperity of the university. The Universities (Scotland) Act 1966 gave the Council the power to consider draft ordinances and resolutions, to be presented with an annual report of the work and activities of the university, and to receive an audited financial statement.[136] The Council elects the chancellor of the university and three Assessors on the University Court.\n\n\n\n#### *Senatus Academicus*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Senatus Academicus* is the university's supreme academic body, chaired by the principal and consisting of the professors, heads of departments, and a number of readers, lecturers and other teaching and research staff.[137] The core function of the *Senatus* is to regulate and supervise the teaching and discipline of the university and to promote research. The *Senatus* elects four Assessors on the University Court. The *Senatus* meets three times per year, hosting a presentation and discussion session which is open to all members of staff at each meeting.\n\n\n\n#### University officials[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, Rector of the University of Edinburgh, and List of Principals of the University of Edinburgh\n\n![](image)\nPrincess Anne, current Chancellor\n![](image)\nDebora Kayembe, current Lord Rector\n![](image)\nSir Peter Mathieson, current Principal and Vice-Chancellor\n\nThe university's three most significant officials are its chancellor, rector, and principal, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.\n\n\nThe office of chancellor serves as the titular head and highest office of the university. Their duties include conferring degrees and enhancing the profile and reputation of the university on national and global levels.[138] The chancellor is elected by the university's General Council, and a person generally remains in the office for life. Previous chancellors include former prime minister Arthur Balfour and novelist Sir J. M. Barrie.[138] Princess Anne has held the position since March 2011 succeeding Prince Philip.[16] She is also Patron of the university's Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies.\n\n\nThe office of rector is elected every three years by the staff and matriculated students. The primary role of the rector is to preside at the University Court.[139] The rector also chairs meetings of the General Council in absence of the chancellor. They work closely with students and Edinburgh University Students' Association. Previous rectors include microbiologist Sir Alexander Fleming, and former Prime Ministers Sir Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George. The current rector is human rights lawyer Debora Kayembe, who has held the position since March 2021.[139][140]\n\n\nThe principal is responsible for the overall operation of the university in a chief executive role.[141] The principal is formally nominated by the Curators of Patronage and appointed by the University Court. They are the President of the *Senatus Academicus* and a member of the University Court *ex officio*.[141] The principal is also automatically appointed vice-chancellor, in which role they confer degrees on behalf of the chancellor. Previous principals include physicist Sir Edward Appleton and religious philosopher Stewart Sutherland. The current principal is nephrologist Sir Peter Mathieson, who has held the position since February 2018.[142]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and schools[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, the university was reorganised from its nine faculties into three 'Colleges'.[143] While technically not a collegiate university, it comprises the Colleges of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), Science & Engineering (CSE) and Medicine & Vet Medicine (CMVM). Within these colleges are 'Schools', which either represent one academic discipline such as Informatics or assemble adjacent academic disciplines such as the School of History, Classics and Archaeology. While bound by College-level policies, individual Schools can differ in their organisation and governance. As of 2021, the university has 21 schools in total.[144]\n\n\n\n#### Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Department of Psychology building at 7 George Square\n![](image)Elsie Inglis Quad at the Old Medical School, currently hosting the School of History, Classics and Archaeology\nThe College took on its current name of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences in 2016 after absorbing the Edinburgh College of Art in 2011.[145] CAHSS offers more than 280 undergraduate degree programmes, 230 taught postgraduate programmes, and 200 research postgraduate programmes.[146][147] Twenty subjects offered by the college were ranked within the top 10 nationally in the 2022 *Complete University Guide*.[148] It includes the oldest English Literature department in Britain,[35] which was ranked 7th globally in the 2021 *QS Rankings by Subject* in English Language & Literature.[149] The college hosts Scotland's ESRC Doctoral Training Centre (DTC), the Scottish Graduate School of Social Science. The college is the largest of the three colleges by enrolment, with 26,130 students and 3,089 academic staff.[150][5]\n\n\n\n* Business School\n* Edinburgh College of Art\n* Moray House School of Education and Sport\n* School of Divinity\n* School of Economics\n* School of Health in Social Science\n* School of History, Classics and Archaeology\n* School of Law\n* School of Literatures, Languages and Cultures\n* School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences\n* School of Social and Political Science\n* Centre for Open Learning\n* Edinburgh Futures Institute\n\n#### Medicine and Veterinary Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Edinburgh College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine\n\n![](image)Members of the medical faculty at Edinburgh in the first half of the 19th century. *Seated* (L–R): J. Y. Simpson, J. Miller, J. H. Balfour and J. H. Bennett. *Standing* (L–R): R. Jameson, W. Alison and T. S. Traill.\nEdinburgh Medical School was widely considered the best medical school in the English-speaking world throughout the 18th century and the first half of the 19th century and contributed significantly to the university's international reputation.[151][152] Its graduates founded medical schools all over the world, including at five of the seven Ivy League universities (Columbia, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania, and Yale); those in McGill, Montréal, Sydney, and Vermont; the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (now part of Imperial College London), Middlesex Hospital, and the London School of Medicine for Women (both now part of UCL).\n\n\nIn the 21st century, the medical school has continued to excel, and it is associated with 13 Nobel Prize recipients: seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and six of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[153] In 2021, it was ranked third in the UK by The Times University Guide,[154] and the Complete University Guide. In 2022, it was ranked the UK's best medical school by the Guardian University Guide,[155] It also ranked 21st in the world by both the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and the QS World University Rankings in 2021.[156]\n\n\nThe Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is a world leader in veterinary education, research and practice. The eight original faculties formed four Faculty Groups in August 1992. Medicine and Veterinary Medicine became one of these, and in 2002 became the smallest of the three colleges, with 7,740 students and 1,896 academic staff.[150][5] The university's teaching hospitals include the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, St John's Hospital, Livingston, Roodlands Hospital, and Royal Hospital for Children and Young People.[157][158][159]\n\n\n\n#### Science and Engineering[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Edinburgh College of Science and Engineering\n\n![](image)Old Surgical Hospital in Drummond Street, once part of the Royal Infirmary, today houses the university's Institute of Geography.\nIn the 16th century, science was taught as \"natural philosophy\" in the university. The 17th century saw the institution of the University Chairs of Mathematics and Botany, followed the next century by Chairs of Natural History, Astronomy, Chemistry and Agriculture. It was Edinburgh's professors who took a leading part in the formation of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1783. Joseph Black, Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the time, founded the world's first Chemical Society in 1785.[160] The first named degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science was instituted in 1864, and a separate Faculty of Science was created in 1893 after three centuries of scientific advances at Edinburgh.[160] The Regius Chair in Engineering was established in 1868, and the Regius Chair in Geology in 1871. In 1991 the Faculty of Science was renamed the Faculty of Science and Engineering, and in 2002 it became the College of Science and Engineering. The college has 11,745 students and 2,937 academic staff.[150][5]\n\n\n\n* School of Biological Sciences\n* School of Chemistry\n* School of Engineering\n* School of GeoSciences\n* School of Informatics\n* School of Mathematics\n* School of Physics and Astronomy\n\n#### Sub-units, centres and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh Futures Institute taking shape on the former site of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh\nSome subunits, centres and institutes within the university are listed as follows:[161]\n\n\n\n* Artificial Intelligence Applications Institute (AIAI)\n* Bayes Centre\n* Centre for the History of the Book (CHB)\n* Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM)\n* Centre for the Study of World Christianity (CSWC)\n* Centre for Theology and Public Issues (CTPI)\n* Digital Curation Centre (DCC)\n* Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre (ECRC)\n* Edinburgh Dental Institute (EDI)\n* Edinburgh Futures Institute (EFI)\n* Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC)\n* Edinburgh School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture (ESALA)\n* Euan MacDonald Centre\n* Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics\n* Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (IASH)\n* International Centre for Mathematical Sciences (ICMS)\n* Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation (ISSTI)\n* Koestler Parapsychology Unit\n* Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS)\n* MRC Human Genetics Unit (MRC HGU)\n* MRC Centre for Inflammation Research\n* Nursing Studies\n* Roslin Institute\n* Salvesen Mindroom Research Centre\n* Scottish Studies\n* UK Centre for Astrobiology (UKCA)\n* Usher Institute\n\n### Staff, Community and Networking[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2023, the University employed over 11,800 full time equivalent staff:[162]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| College of Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences | 2,804\n |\n| College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine | 2,868\n |\n| College of Science & Engineering | 2,709\n |\n| Corporate Services Group\n | 2,145\n |\n| Information Services Group\n | 685\n |\n| University Secretaries Group\n | 674\n |\n| **University of Edinburgh Total:** | **11,885**\n |\n\n\nAs part of the university's support for researchers,[163] each College has Research Staff Societies that include postdoc societies, and organisations specific to each school.[164] Cross-curricula Research Networks bring together researchers working on similar topics.[165]\n\n\nIndependently of the College hierarchy, aligned with the university's EDI policy, seven Staff Networks bring together and represent diverse staff groups:[166]\n\n\n\n1.

A Marking and Assessment Boycott[176] that commenced on 20 April 2023[177] was called off on 6 September 2023.[178] However, the UCU voted to continue strike action throughout the rest of September.[179][180]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, and the *Sutton 13* group of top-ranked universities in the UK.[181] It is the only British university to be a member of both the Coimbra Group and the League of European Research Universities, and it is a founding member of Una Europa and Universitas 21, both international associations of research-intensive universities.[182] The university maintains historically strong ties with the neighbouring Heriot-Watt University for teaching and research. Edinburgh also offers a wide range of free online MOOC courses on three global platforms Coursera, Edx and FutureLearn.[183][184]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics[14]\n|  | 2022\n | 2021\n | 2020\n | 2019\n | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 75,438\n | 68,954\n | 62,220\n | 60,983\n | 58,411\n |\n| **Offers** | 25,210\n | 32,432\n | 31,510\n | 27,878\n | 25,532\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 33.0\n | 47.0\n | 50.6\n | 45.7\n | 43.7\n |\n| **Enrolls** | 6,111\n | 8,083\n | 7,344\n | 6,346\n | 6,221\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 24.2\n | 24.9\n | 23.3\n | 22.8\n | 24.4\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 12.34\n | 8.53\n | 8.47\n | 9.61\n | 9.39\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[15] | —\n | 197\n | 190\n | 186\n | 187\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[185] and Ethnicity[186] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[c] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[187][188] |\n| Female | 61%\n | 61 |\n| Private School | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Low Participation Areas[d] | 9%\n | 9 |\n\n\nIn 2021, the University of Edinburgh had the seventh-highest average entry standards amongst universities in the UK, with new undergraduates averaging 197 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAA in A-level grades.[15] It gave offers of admission to 33% of its 18 year old applicants in 2022, the fourth-lowest amongst the Russell Group.[189]\n\n\nIn 2022, excluding courses within Edinburgh College of Art, the most competitive courses for Scottish applicants were Oral Health Science (9%), Business (11%), Philosophy & Psychology (14%), Social Work (15%), and International Business (15%).[190] For students from the rest of the UK, the most competitive courses were Nursing (5%), Medicine (6%), Veterinary Medicine (6%), Psychology (8%), and Politics, Philosophy and Economics (10%).[191] For international students, the most competitive courses were Medicine (5%), Nursing (7%), Business (11%), Politics, Philosophy and\nEconomics (12%), and Sociology (13%).[192]\n\n\nFor the academic year 2019/20, 36.8% of Edinburgh's new undergraduates were privately educated, the second-highest proportion among mainstream British universities, behind only Oxford.[193] As of August 2021, it has a higher proportion of female than male students with a male to female ratio of 38:62 in the undergraduate population, and the undergraduate student body is composed of 30% Scottish students, 32% from the rest of the UK, 10% from the EU, and 28% from outside the EU.[5]\n\n\n\n### Graduation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Edinburgh\n\n![](image)Edinburgh graduation ceremony in the McEwan Hall\nAt graduation ceremonies, graduates are being 'capped' with the *Geneva bonnet*, which involves the university's principal tapping them on the head with the cap while they receive their graduation certificate.[194] The velvet-and-silk hat has been used for over 150 years, and legend says that it was originally made from cloth taken from the breeches of 16th-century scholars John Knox or George Buchanan.[195] However, when the hat was last restored in the early 2000s, a label dated 1849 was discovered bearing the name of Edinburgh tailor Henry Banks, although some doubt remains whether he manufactured or restored the hat.[194][196] In 2006, a university emblem that had been taken into space by astronaut and Edinburgh graduate Piers Sellers was incorporated into the *Geneva bonnet*.[197]\n\n\n\n### Library system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh University Library\n\n![](image)Playfair Library Hall in Old College\nPre-dating the university by three years, Edinburgh University Library was founded in 1580 through the donation of a large collection by Clement Litill, and today is the largest academic library collection in Scotland.[198][199] The Brutalist style eight-storey Main Library building in George Square was designed by Sir Basil Spence. At the time of its completion in 1967, it was the largest building of its type in the UK, and today is a category A listed building.[200] The library system also includes many specialised libraries at the college and school level.[201]\n\n\n\n### Exchange programmes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The former principal Sir Timothy O'Shea signed an agreement with Peking University in 2012.\nThe university offers students the opportunity to study in Europe and beyond via the European Union's Erasmus+ programme[e] and a variety of international exchange agreements with around 300 partners institutions in nearly 40 countries worldwide.[203]\n\n\nUniversity-wide exchanges are open to almost any student whose degree permits a year abroad and who can find a suitable course combination.

Research Excellence Framework (REF), which evaluated work produced between 2014 and 2021, Edinburgh ranked 4th by research power and 15th by GPA amongst British universities.[212] The university fell four places in GPA when compared to the 2014 REF, but retained its place in research power.[213] 90 per cent of the university's research activity was judged to be 'world leading' (4\\*) or 'internationally excellent' (3\\*), and five departments – Computer Science, Informatics, Sociology, Anthropology, and Development Studies – were ranked as the best in the UK.[214]\n\n\nIn the 2015 *THE Global Employability University Ranking*, Edinburgh ranked 23rd in the world and 4th in the UK for graduate employability as voted by international recruiters.[215] A 2015 government report found that Edinburgh was one of only two Scottish universities (along with St Andrews) that some London-based elite recruitment firms considered applicants from, especially in the field of financial services and investment banking.[216] When *The New York Times* ranked universities based on the employability of graduates as evaluated by recruiters from top companies in 20 countries in 2012, Edinburgh was placed at 42nd in the world and 7th in Britain.[217]\n\n\nEdinburgh was ranked 24th in the world and 5th in the UK by the 2021 *Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities*, a league table based on the three major world university rankings, *ARWU*, *QS* and *THE*.[218] In the 2022 *U.S. News & World Report*, Edinburgh ranked 32nd globally and 5th nationally.[219] The 2022 *World Reputation Rankings* placed Edinburgh at 32nd worldwide and 5th nationwide.[220] In 2023, it ranked 73rd amongst the universities around the world by the *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[221]\n\n\nThe disparity between Edinburgh's research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely due to the impact of measures of 'student satisfaction'.[222] Edinburgh was ranked last in the UK for teaching quality in the 2012 National Student Survey,[223] with the 2015 *Good University Guide* stating that this stemmed from \"questions to do with the promptness, usefulness and extent of academic feedback\", and that the university \"still has a long way to go to turn around a poor position\".[224] Edinburgh improved only marginally over the next years, with the 2021 *Good University Guide* still ranking it in the bottom 10 domestically in both teaching quality and student experience.[225] Edinburgh was ranked 122nd out of 128 universities for student satisfaction in the 2022 *Complete University Guide*, although it was ranked 12th overall.[226] The 2024 *Guardian University Guide* ranked Edinburgh 14th overall, but 50th out of 120 universities in teaching satisfaction, and lowest among all universities in satisfaction with feedback.[227]\n\n\nIn the 2022 *Complete University Guide*, 32 out of the 49 subjects offered by Edinburgh were ranked within the top 10 in the UK, with Asian Studies (4th), Chemical Engineering (4th), Education (2nd), Geology (5th), Linguistics (5th), Mechanical Engineering (5th), Medicine (5th), Music (5th), Nursing (1st), Physics & Astronomy (5th), Social Policy (5th), Theology & Religious Studies (4th), and Veterinary Medicine (2nd) within the top 5.[226] The 2021 *THE World University Rankings by Subject* ranked Edinburgh 10th worldwide in Arts and Humanities, 15th in Law, 16th in Psychology, 21st in Clinical, Pre-clinical & Health, 22nd in Computer Science, 28th in Education, 28th in Life Science, 43rd in Business & Economics, 44th in Social Sciences, 45th in Physical Sciences, and 86th in Engineering & Technology.[228] The 2023 *QS World University Rankings by Subject* placed Edinburgh at 10th globally in Arts & Humanities, 23rd in Life Sciences & Medicine, 36th in Natural Sciences, 50th in Social Sciences & Management, and 59th in Engineering & Technology.[229] According to *CSRankings*, computer science at Edinburgh was ranked 1st in the UK and 36th globally, and Edinburgh was the best in natural language processing (NLP) in the world.[230]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students' Association[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh University Students' Association\n\n![](image)The Pleasance, one of EUSA's main buildings, is a theatre, bar, sports and recreation complex.\nEdinburgh University Students' Association (EUSA) consists of the students' union and the students' representative council. EUSA's buildings include Teviot Row House, The Pleasance, Potterrow Student Centre, Kings Buildings House, as well as shops, cafés and refectories across the various campuses. Teviot Row House is considered the oldest purpose-built student union building in the world.[59][231] Most of these buildings are operated as Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues during August. EUSA represents students to the university and the wider world, and is responsible for over 250 student societies at the university. The association has five sabbatical office bearers – a president and four vice presidents. EUSA is affiliated with the National Union of Students (NUS).\n\n\n\n### Performing arts[edit]\n\n\nAmateur dramatic societies benefit from Edinburgh being an important cultural hub for comedy, amateur and fringe theatre throughout the UK, most prominently through the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.[232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Edinburgh University Music Society, performing Mahler in Greyfriars Kirk\nThe Edinburgh University Music Society (EUMS) is a student-run musical organisation, which is Scotland's oldest student's musical society; it can be traced back to a concert in February 1867.[233] It performs three concert series throughout the year whilst also undertaking a programme of charity events and education projects.[234]\n\n\n\n![](image)The student-run Bedlam Theatre, home to the Edinburgh University Theatre Company\nThe Edinburgh University Theatre Company (EUTC), founded in 1890 as the Edinburgh University Drama Society, is known for running Bedlam Theatre, the oldest student-run theatre in Britain and venue for the Fringe.[235][236] EUTC also funds acclaimed improvisational comedy troupe The Improverts during term time and the Fringe.[237][238] Alumni include Sir Michael Boyd, Ian Charleson, Kevin McKidd, and Greg Wise.\n\n\nThe Edinburgh Studio Opera (formerly Edinburgh University Opera Club) is a student opera company in Edinburgh. It performs at least one fully staged opera each year.[239] The Edinburgh University Savoy Opera Group (EUSOG) is an opera and musical theatre company founded by students in 1961 to promote and perform the comic operettas of Sir William Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan, collectively known as Savoy Operas after the theatre in which they were originally staged.[240]\n\n\nThe Edinburgh University Footlights are a musical theatre company founded in 1989 and produce two large scale shows a year.[241][242] One of the founders is the Theatre Producer Colin Ingram.[243] Theatre Parodok, founded in 2004, is a student theatre company that aims to produce shows that are \"experimental without being exclusive\". They stage one large show each semester and one for the festival.[244]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n*The Student* is a fortnightly student newspaper. Founded in 1887 by writer Robert Louis Stevenson, it is the oldest student newspaper in the United Kingdom.[245] Former writers of the newspaper include politicians Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, and Lord Steel of Aikwood.[246][247] It has been independent of the university since 1992, but was forced to temporarily fold in 2002 due to increasing debts. The newspaper won a number of student newspaper awards in the years following its relaunch.[245]\n\n\n*The Journal* was an independent publication, established in 2007 by three students and former writers for *The Student.* It was also distributed to other higher education institutions in the city, such as Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh Napier University, and Telford College. It was the largest such publication in Scotland, with a print run of 10,000 copies. Despite winning a number of awards for its journalism, the magazine folded in 2015 due to financial difficulties.[248]\n\n\nFreshAir, launched on 3 October 1992, is an alternative music student radio station. The station is one of the oldest surviving student radio stations in the UK, and won the \"Student Radio Station of the Year\" award at the annual Student Radio Awards in 2004.[249]\n\n\nIn September 2015, the Edinburgh University Student Television (EUTV) became the newest addition to the student media scene at the university, producing a regular magazine-style programme, documentaries and other special events.[250]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edinburgh University Sports Union\n\n![](image)Edinburgh University Mountaineering Club at the cairn on Ciste Dhubh, 1964\nStudent sport at Edinburgh consists of clubs covering the more traditional rugby, football, rowing and judo, to the more unconventional korfball, gliding and mountaineering. In 2021, the university had over 65 sports clubs run by Edinburgh University Sports Union (EUSU).[251]\n\n\nThe Scottish Varsity, known as the \"world's oldest varsity match\", is a rugby match played annually against the University of St Andrews dating back over 150 years.[252] Discontinued in the 1950s, the match was resurrected in 2011 and was staged in London at the home of London Scottish RFC. It is played at the beginning of the academic year, and since 2015 has been staged at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh.[253]\n\n\nThe Scottish Boat Race is an annual rowing race between the Glasgow University Boat Club and the Edinburgh University Boat Club, rowed between competing eights on the River Clyde in Glasgow, Scotland. Started in 1877, it is believed to be the third-oldest university boat race in the world, predated by the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race and the Harvard–Yale Regatta.[254]\n\n\nEdinburgh athletes have repeatedly been successful at the Olympic Games: Sprinter Eric Liddell won gold and bronze at the 1924 Summer Olympics. At the 1948 Summer Olympics, alumnus Jackie Robinson won a gold medal with the American Basketball team. Trap shooter Bob Braithwaite secured a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics. Cyclist Sir Chris Hoy won six gold and one silver medal between 2000 and 2012. Rower Dame Katherine Grainger won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, and four further silver medals between 2000 and 2016. Edinburgh was the most successful UK university at the 2012 Games with two gold medals from Hoy and one from Grainger.[255]\n\n\n\n### Student activism[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of campaigning societies at the university. The largest of these include the environment and poverty campaigning group People & Planet and Amnesty International Society. International development organisations include Edinburgh Global Partnerships, which was established as a student-led charity in 1990.[256] There is also a significant left-wing presence on campus,[257] including an anti-austerity group, Edinburgh University Anarchist Society, Edinburgh University Socialist Society, Edinburgh Young Greens, Feminist Society, LGBT+ Pride,[258] Marxist Society, and Students for Justice in Palestine.[259]\n\n\nProtests, demonstrations and occupations are regular occurrences at the university.[260][261][262] The activist group People & Planet took over Charles Stewart House in 2015 and again in 2016 in protest over the university's investment in companies active in arms manufacturing or fossil fuel extraction.[263][264] In May 2015, a security guard was charged in relation to the occupations.[265]\n\n\n\n### Student co-operatives[edit]\n\n\nThere are three student-run co-operatives associated with the University: Edinburgh Student Housing Co-operative (ESHC), providing affordable housing for 106 students;[266] the Hearty Squirrel Food Cooperative, providing local, organic and affordable food to students and staff;[267] and the SHRUB Coop, a swap and re-use hub aimed at reducing waste and promoting sustainability.[268] Of these, only the Hearty Squirrel Co-operative operates on campus. ESHC is based on the Bruntsfield Links south of the University's central campus, and hosts students from all three city universities and Edinburgh College. The SHRUB co-operative was formed partly by University of Edinburgh students but is now run by interested members from across Edinburgh. The co-operatives form part of the Students for Cooperation network.[269]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Edinburgh people and List of University of Edinburgh medical people\n\nThe university is associated with some of the most significant intellectual and scientific contributions in human history, which include: the foundation of Antiseptic surgery (Joseph Lister),[270] Bayesian statistics (Thomas Bayes),[271] Economics (Adam Smith),[272] Electromagnetism (James Clerk Maxwell),[273] Evolution (Charles Darwin),[274][275] Knot theory (Peter Guthrie Tait),[276] modern Geology (James Hutton),[277] Nephrology (Richard Bright),[278] Endocrinology (Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer),[279] Hematology (William Hewson),[280] Dermatology (Robert Willan),[281] Epigenetics (C.

Scenes were filmed at the old School of Anatomy.[387]\n* Many of Arthur Conan Doyle's works drew inspiration from his mentors at the university. Joseph Bell, a lecturer and surgeon famous for drawing conclusions from minute observations, became the archetype for Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. William Rutherford, Conan Doyle's physiology professor provided the template for Professor Challenger, the protagonist of his science fiction work *The Lost World* (1912). Edinburgh is also Challenger's *alma mater* in the books.\n* Dr. Fu Manchu, a fictional supervillain created by Sax Rohmer in 1912, stated that \"I am a doctor of philosophy from Edinburgh, a doctor of law from Christ's College, a doctor of medicine from Harvard. My friends, out of courtesy, call me 'Doctor'.\"[g] In 2010, Fu Manchu's connections with the University where he supposedly obtained a doctorate were investigated in a mockumentary by Miles Jupp (also an Edinburgh alumnus) for BBC Radio 4.[388][389]\n* In the movie *Journey to the Center of the Earth* (1959), an adaptation of Jules Verne's novel of the same name, the protagonist Sir Oliver Lindenbrook is a Professor of Geology at the university. An early scene where Lindenbrook addresses the students is filmed at the central quadrangle of Old College.[390]\n* The historical film *Chariots of Fire* (1981) is based on the story of Olympic runner and Edinburgh graduate Eric Liddell, and includes scenes filmed outside of Assembly Hall, New College.[391] Liddell is played by Ian Charleson, who is also an Edinburgh alumnus.\n* In the novel *The Last King of Scotland* (1998) by Giles Foden, the fictional protagonist Dr. Nicholas Garrigan is a medical doctor recently graduated from Edinburgh. The 2006 film of the same name stars James McAvoy in the role of Dr. Garrigan with the same background.\n* In the American television show *NCIS* (2003–present), the chief medical examiner, Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard studied medicine at Edinburgh. Ari Haswari, the show's main antagonist for the first two seasons, also studied medicine at Edinburgh.[392]\n* In the novel *One Day* (2009), the lead characters Dexter and Emma both graduated from Edinburgh. A feature film based on the book, also titled *One Day* and starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess was released in August 2011, with some scenes filmed at the university.[393] A Netflix adaptation of the movie started production in 2021, with filming occurring in the grounds of Old College in 2022.[394]\n* The BBC legal drama *Garrow's Law* (2009–2011) was largely filmed in Edinburgh, despite being set in London.

The main campus is south of Manchester City Centre on Oxford Road. The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the Manchester Museum, The Whitworth art gallery, the John Rylands Library, the Tabley House Collection and the Jodrell Bank Observatory – a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[9][10] The University of Manchester is considered a red brick university, a product of the civic university movement of the late 19th century. The current University of Manchester was formed in 2004 following the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and the Victoria University of Manchester.[11][12] This followed a century of the two institutions working closely with one another.[13]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology had its origins in the Mechanics' Institute, which was founded in 1824. The present University of Manchester considers this date, which is also the date of foundation of the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, one of the predecessor institutions of the Victoria University of Manchester, as its official foundation year, as indicated in its crest and logo. The founders of the institute believed that all professions somewhat relied on scientific principles. As such, the institute taught working individuals branches of science applicable to their existing occupations. They believed that the practical application of science would encourage innovation and advancements within those trades and professions.[14] The Victoria University of Manchester was founded in 1851, as Owens College. Academic research undertaken by the university was published via the Manchester University Press from 1904.[15]\n\n\nManchester is the third-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and receives over 92,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the most popular university in the UK by volume of applications.[16] The University of Manchester is a member of the Russell Group, the N8 Group, and the US-based Universities Research Association. The University of Manchester, inclusive of its predecessor institutions, has had 25 Nobel laureates amongst its past and present students and staff, the fourth-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins (1824 to 2004)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UMIST and Victoria University of Manchester\n\n![](image)The Old Quadrangle at the University of Manchester's main campus on Oxford Road\nThe University of Manchester traces its roots to the formation of the Mechanics' Institute (later UMIST) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester's pride in being the world's first industrial city.[17] The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics' Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science.\n\n\nJohn Owens, a textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (around £5.6 million in 2005 prices)[18] to found a college to educate men on non-sectarian lines. His trustees established Owens College in 1851 in a house on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist Richard Cobden, and subsequently housed Manchester County Court. The locomotive designer Charles Beyer became a governor of the college and was the largest single donor to the college extension fund, which raised the money to move to a new site and construct the main building now known as the John Owens building. He also campaigned and helped fund the engineering chair, the first applied science department in the north of England. He left the college the equivalent of £10 million in his will in 1876, at a time when it was in great financial difficulty. Beyer funded the total cost of construction of the Beyer Building to house the biology and geology departments. His will also funded Engineering chairs and the Beyer Professor of Applied mathematics.\n\n\nThe university has a rich German heritage. The Owens College Extension Movement formed their plans after a tour of mainly German universities and polytechnics.[19][20] A Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement, had studied at Heidelberg University. Sir Henry Roscoe also studied at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen and they collaborated for many years on research projects. Roscoe promoted the German style of research-led teaching that became the role model for the red-brick universities. Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic. There were many Germans on the staff, including Carl Schorlemmer, Britain's first chair in organic chemistry, and Arthur Schuster, professor of physics.[21] There was even a German chapel on the campus.\n\n\nIn 1873, Owens College moved to new premises on Oxford Road, Chorlton-on-Medlock, and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University. This university was established and granted a royal charter in 1880, becoming England's first civic university; following Liverpool and Leeds becoming independent, it was renamed the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year.[22]\n\n\nBy 1905, the two institutions were large and active forces. The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester's Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together.[23] However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees. A decade later the development was reversed.[6] The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.[24][25]\n\n\nBefore the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students, with two further Nobel laureates being subsequently added. Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world's first electronic stored-program computer was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre. The author Anthony Burgess, Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize-winning architect Norman Foster and composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked at, Manchester.\n\n\n\n### Post-merger (2004 to present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sackville Street Building, formerly the UMIST Main Building\nThe current University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when Queen Elizabeth II bestowed its royal charter.[26] The university was named the *Sunday Times* University of the Year in 2006 after winning the inaugural *Times Higher Education Supplement* University of the Year prize in 2005.[27]\n\n\nThe founding president and vice-chancellor of the new university was Alan Gilbert, former vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who retired at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year.[28] His successor was Dame Nancy Rothwell,[3] who had held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994. One of the university's aims stated in the *Manchester 2015 Agenda* is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert's aim to \"establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance\".[29] In 2011, four Nobel laureates were on its staff: Andre Geim,[30] Konstantin Novoselov,[31] Sir John Sulston and Joseph E. Stiglitz.\n\n\nThe EPSRC announced in February 2012 the formation of the National Graphene Institute. The University of Manchester is the \"single supplier invited to submit a proposal for funding the new £45m institute, £38m of which will be provided by the government\" – (EPSRC & Technology Strategy Board).[32] In 2013, an additional £23 million of funding from European Regional Development Fund was awarded to the institute taking investment to £61 million.[33]\n\n\nIn August 2012, it was announced that the university's Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences had been chosen to be the \"hub\" location for a new BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, as part of a $100 million initiative to create industry-changing materials.[34][35] The centre will be aimed at advancing fundamental understanding and use of materials across a variety of oil and gas industrial applications and will be modelled on a hub and spoke structure, with the hub located at Manchester, and the spokes based at the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.[36]\n\n\nIn 2020 the university saw a series of student rent strikes and protests in opposition to the university's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent levels and living conditions in the university's halls of residence. The protests ended with a negotiated rent reduction.\n\n\nIn 2023, a second rent strike and student protest in opposition to the university's rent price and living conditions in the halls of residence started. The protests included occupations, marches and student's withholding their rent in University accommodation.[37][38][39] The University's response to the protests included using bailiffs to evict occupiers and taking disciplinary action against some occupiers.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the university campus, with all buildings labelled\nThe university's main site contains most of its facilities and is often referred to as the *campus*, however Manchester is not a campus university as the concept is commonly understood. It is centrally located in the city and its buildings are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between.\n\n\nThe campus occupies an area shaped roughly like a boot: the foot of which is aligned roughly south-west to north-east and is joined to the broader southern part of the boot by an area of overlap between former UMIST and former VUM buildings;[42] it comprises two parts:\n\n\n\n* *North campus* or *Sackville Street Campus*, centred on Sackville Street in Manchester\n* *South campus* or *Oxford Road Campus*, centred on Oxford Road.\n\n\nThe names are not officially recognised by the university, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website and roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively.\n\n\nFallowfield Campus is the main residential campus in Fallowfield, approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) south of the main site.\n\n\nThere are other university buildings across the city and the wider region, such as Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire and One Central Park in Moston, a collaboration between the university and other partners which offers office space for start-up firms and venues for conferences and workshops,[43]\n\n\n\n### Major projects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The atrium inside the £38m Manchester Institute of Biotechnology\nFollowing the merger, the university embarked on a £600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets.[44] These include:\n\n\n\n* £60 m Flagship *University Place* building (new build)\n* £56 m Alan Turing Building houses Mathematics, replaced Mathematics Tower. Home to the Photon Sciences Institute and the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (new build)\n* £50 m Life Sciences Research Building (A. V. Hill Building) (new build)\n* £38 m Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB) (new build)\n* £33 m Life Sciences and Medical and Human Sciences Building (Michael Smith Building) (new build)\n* £31 m Humanities Building – now officially called the \"Arthur Lewis Building\" (new build)\n* £20 m Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre (WMIC) (new build)\n* £18 m Re-location of School of Pharmacy\n* £17 m John Rylands Library, Deansgate (extension & refurbishment of existing building)\n* £13 m Chemistry Building\n* £10 m Functional Biology Building\n* £350 m Manchester Engineering Campus Development (will be formally opened to students in September 2022, new build)\n\n\n### Old Quadrangle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The buildings of the University of Manchester and the Manchester Museum in Oxford Road\nThe buildings around the Old Quadrangle date from the time of Owens College, and were designed in a Gothic style by Alfred Waterhouse and his son Paul Waterhouse. The first to be built was the John Owens Building (1873), formerly the Main Building; the others were added over the next thirty years. Today, the museum continues to occupy part of one side, including the tower. The grand setting of the Whitworth Hall is used for the conferment of degrees, and part of the old Christie Library (1898) now houses Christie's Bistro. The remainder of the buildings house administrative departments. The less easily accessed Rear Quadrangle, dating mostly from 1873, is older in its completed form than the Old Quadrangle.\n\n\n\n### Contact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Contact Theatre\nMain article: Contact Theatre\n\nContact stages modern live performance for all ages, and participatory workshops primarily for young people aged 13 to 30. The building on Devas Street was completed in 1999 incorporating parts of its 1960s predecessor.[45] It has a unique energy-efficient ventilation system, using its high towers to naturally ventilate the building without the use of air conditioning. The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and *Hot Air*, a reactive public artwork in the foyer.\n\n\n\n### Other notable buildings[edit]\n\n\nOther notable buildings in the Oxford Road Campus include the Stephen Joseph Studio, a former German Protestant church and the Samuel Alexander Building, a grade II listed building[46] erected in 1919 and home of the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures.\n\n\nIn the Sackville Street Campus is the Sackville Street Building which was formerly UMIST's \"Main Building\". It was opened in 1902 by the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour.[47] Built using Burmantofts terracotta, the building is now Grade II listed. It was extended along Whitworth Street, towards London Road, between 1927 and 1957 by the architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope, completion being delayed due to the depression in the 1930s and the Second World War.\n\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Faculties and schools[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester was divided into four faculties, but from 1 August 2016 it was restructured into three faculties, each sub-divided into schools.\n\n\nOn 25 June 2015, the University of Manchester announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty. As a result of this review the Faculty of Life Sciences was to be dismantled, most of its personnel to be incorporated into a single medical/biological faculty, with a substantial minority being incorporated into a science and engineering faculty.\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Medical School on Coupland Street (photographed in 1908), which now houses the School of Dentistry\nThe faculty is divided into the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medical Sciences and the School of Health Sciences.\n\n\nBiological Sciences have been taught at Manchester as far back as the foundation of Owens College in 1851. At UMIST, biological teaching and research began in 1959, with the creation of a Biochemistry department.[48] The present school, though unitary for teaching, is divided into a number of sections for research purposes.\n\n\nThe medical college was established in 1874 and is one of the largest in the country,[49] with more than 400 medical students trained in each clinical year and more than 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years. The university is a founding partner of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester.[50] In November 2018, Expertscape recognized it as one of the top ten institutions worldwide in COPD research and treatment.[51]\n\n\nIn 1883, a department of pharmacy was established at the university and, in 1904, Manchester became the first British university to offer an honours degree in the subject. The School of Pharmacy[52] benefits from links with Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe and Hope hospitals providing its undergraduate students with hospital experience.[53]\n\n\nManchester Dental School was rated the country's best dental school by *Times Higher Education* in 2010 and 2011[54] and it is one of the best funded because of its emphasis on research and enquiry-based learning approach. The university has obtained multimillion-pound backing to maintain its high standard of dental education.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Science and Engineering[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Grade I listed Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory\nThe Faculty of Science and Engineering is divided into two schools. The School of Engineering comprises the departments of: Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. The School of Natural Sciences comprises the departments of: Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Physics and Astronomy, Materials and Mathematics.\n\n\nThe Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics comprises the university's astronomical academic staff in Manchester and Jodrell Bank Observatory on rural land near Goostrey, about ten miles (16 km) west of Macclesfield. The observatory's Lovell Telescope is named after Sir Bernard Lovell, a professor at the Victoria University of Manchester who first proposed the telescope. Constructed in the 1950s, it is the third largest fully movable radio telescope in the world. It has played an important role in the research of quasars, pulsars and gravitational lenses, and in confirming Einstein's theory of General Relativity.\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Humanities[edit]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Humanities includes the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures (incorporating Archaeology; Art History & Visual Studies; Classics and Ancient History; Drama; English and American Studies; History; Linguistics; Modern Languages; Museology; Music; Religions and Theology and the University Language Centre) and the Schools of Combined Studies; Education; Environment and Development; Architecture; Law; Social Sciences and the Manchester Business School. The Faculty of Humanities also jointly administers the Manchester School of Architecture (MSA) in conjunction with Manchester Metropolitan University and MSA students are classified as students of both universities.\n\n\nAdditionally, the faculty comprises a number of research institutes: the Centre for New Writing, the Institute for Social Change, the Brooks World Poverty Institute, Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute, the Manchester Institute for Innovation Research, the Research Institute for Cosmopolitan Cultures, the Centre for Chinese Studies, the Institute for Development Policy and Management, the Centre for Equity in Education and the Sustainable Consumption Institute.\n\n\n\n![](image)The university's Whitworth Hall\n![](image)Whitworth Hall interior\n### Professional services[edit]\n\n\nA number of professional services, organised as \"directorates\", support the university. These include: Directorate of Compliance and Risk, Directorate of Estates and Facilities, Directorate of Finance, Directorate of Planning, Directorate of Human Resources, Directorate of IT Services, Directorate of Legal Affairs and Board Secretariat and Governance Office, Directorate of Research and Business Engagement, Directorate for the Student Experience, Division of Communications and Marketing, Division of Development and Alumni Relations, Office for Social Responsibility and the University Library. Additionally, professional services staff are found within the faculty structure, in such roles as technician and experimental officer.\n\n\nEach directorate reports to the registrar, secretary and chief operating officer, who in turn reports to the president of the university. There is also a director of faculty operations in each faculty, overseeing support for these areas.[56]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2011, the University of Manchester had a total income of £808.58 million (2009/10 – £787.9 million) and total expenditure of £754.51 million (2009/10 – £764.55 million).[1] Key sources of income included £247.28 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2009/10 – £227.75 million), £203.22 million from funding body grants (2009/10 – £209.02 million), £196.24 million from research grants and contracts (2009/10 – £194.6 million) and £14.84 million from endowment and investment income (2009/10 – £11.38 million).[1] During the 2010/11 financial year the University of Manchester had a capital expenditure of £57.42 million (2009/10 – £37.95 million).[1]\n\n\nAt year end the University of Manchester had endowments of £158.7 million (2009/10 – £144.37 million) and total net assets of £731.66 million (2009/10 – £677.12 million).[1]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester is the 3rd largest university in the UK (following The Open University and University College London).[57] The University of Manchester attracts international students from 160 countries around the world.[58]\n\n\nWell-known members of the university's current academic staff include computer scientist Steve Furber, economist Richard Nelson,[59] novelist Jeanette Winterson[60] and biochemist Sir John Sulston, Nobel Prize laureate of 2002.\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester is a major centre for research and a member of the Russell Group of leading British research universities.[61] In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and eighth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (tenth when including specialist institutions).[62][63] In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and fifteenth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (seventeenth when including specialist institutions).[64][65] Manchester has the sixth largest research income of any English university (after Oxford, University College London (UCL), Cambridge, Imperial and King's College London),[66] and has been informally referred to as part of a \"golden diamond\" of research-intensive UK institutions (adding Manchester to the Oxford–Cambridge–London \"Golden Triangle\").[67] Manchester has a strong record in terms of securing funding from the three main UK research councils, EPSRC, MRC and BBSRC, being ranked fifth,[68] seventh[69] and first[70] respectively. In addition, the university is one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: an estimate in 2008 placed it third, surpassed only by Oxford and Cambridge.[71]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester has attracted the most research income from UK industry of any institution in the country. The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), show that Manchester attracted £24,831,000 of research income in 2016–2017 from UK industry, commerce and public corporations.[72]\n\n\nHistorically, Manchester has been linked with high scientific achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford and Cambridge) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill).[73] The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more than any other in the UK.[74] The Langworthy Professorship, an endowed chair at the university's Department of Physics and Astronomy, has been historically given to a long line of academic luminaries, including Ernest Rutherford (1907–19), Lawrence Bragg (1919–37), Patrick Blackett (1937–53) and more recently Konstantin Novoselov, all of whom have won the Nobel Prize. In 2013 Manchester was given the Regius Professorship in Physics, the only one of its kind in the UK; the current holder is Andre Geim.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Grade-I listed John Rylands Library on Deansgate\nMain article: University of Manchester Library\n\nThe University of Manchester Library is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK and the third-largest academic library after those of Oxford and Cambridge.[75] It has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK.[75]\n\n\nThe John Rylands Library, founded in memory of John Rylands by his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands as an independent institution, is situated in a Victorian Gothic building on Deansgate, in the city centre. It houses an important collection of historic books and other printed materials, manuscripts, including archives and papyri. The papyri are in ancient languages and include the oldest extant New Testament document, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, commonly known as the *St John Fragment*. In April 2007 the Deansgate site reopened to readers and the public after major improvements and renovations, including the construction of the pitched roof originally intended and a new wing.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n#### Manchester Museum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the Manchester Museum\nMain article: Manchester Museum\n\nThe Manchester Museum holds nearly 4.25 million[76] items sourced from many parts of the world. The collections include butterflies and carvings from India, birds and bark-cloth from the Pacific, live frogs and ancient pottery from America, fossils and native art from Australia, mammals and ancient Egyptian craftsmanship from Africa, plants, coins and minerals from Europe, art from past civilisations of the Mediterranean, and beetles, armour and archery from Asia. In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised *Tyrannosaurus rex* called \"Stan\".\n\n\nThe museum's first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of Natural History, and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society. Due to the society's financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London's Natural History Museum, to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public. The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Whitworth Art Gallery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Whitworth Art Gallery\n\n![](image)The Whitworth Art Gallery\nThe Whitworth Art Gallery houses collections of internationally known British watercolours, textiles and wallpapers, modern and historic prints, drawings, paintings and sculpture. Its collection contains 31,000 items. A programme of temporary exhibitions runs throughout the year and the Mezzanine Court displays sculpture.\n\n\nThe gallery was founded by Robert Darbishire with a donation from Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1889, as *The Whitworth Institute and Park*. In 1959, the gallery became part of the Victoria University of Manchester.[78] In October 1995, the Mezzanine Court in the centre of the building was opened. It was designed to display sculptures and won a RIBA regional award.[79]\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[80] | 19 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[81] | 24 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[82] | 23 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[83] | 41 |\n| *QS* (2025)[84] | 32 |\n| *THE* (2024)[85] | 51 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Manchester's national league table performance over the past ten years\nAccording to the 2020 Graduate Market Review published by High Fliers, Manchester is the most targeted university by the top 100 graduate employers in the UK.[86]\n\n\nAs of 2021, the University of Manchester has been recognised as the 27th best university in the world by QS. The university was ranked 6th nationally. The University of Manchester was ranked 36th in the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020. It had the 5th highest ranking of UK universities on this list. In 2019, the university placed 4th nationally in Reuters' list of the World's Most Innovative Universities.[87]\n\n\nAccording to *The Sunday Times* in 2006, \"Manchester has a formidable reputation spanning most disciplines, but most notably in the life sciences, engineering, humanities, economics, sociology and the social sciences\".[88] Manchester was given a prestigious award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts by the *Times Higher Education Awards 2010*.[89]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Alliance Manchester Business School was ranked 3rd in UK, 10th in Europe and 30th in the world by the *Financial Times* in its global MBA ranking.[90]\n\n\nHowever, while world rankings (such as QS, ARWU, THE) typically place the university within the top 10 in the UK, the university ranks slightly less favourably in national studies. 'The Complete University Guide 2022' ranked Manchester 13th out of universities in the UK, and ‘The Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide 2021' placed it at 18th.[87] A 2016 poll voted Manchester as the third \"most underrated university in the UK\".[91]\n\n\nIn 2022, the University of Manchester was ranked at number 38 in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).\n\n\nDeputy President and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Luke Georgiou, said: “The ranking tables, despite their limitations, give a consistent picture of The University of Manchester’s excellence in national and global terms.”[92]\n\n\n\n### Manchester University Press[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Manchester University Press\n\nManchester University Press is the university's academic publishing house. It publishes academic monographs, textbooks and journals, most of which are works from authors based elsewhere in the international academic community, and is the third-largest university press in England after Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students' Union[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Students' Union building on Oxford Road\nMain article: University of Manchester Students' Union\n\nThe University of Manchester Students' Union is the representative body of students at the university and the UK's largest students' union. It was formed out of the merger between UMIST Students' Association and University of Manchester Union when the parent organisations UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester merged on 1 October 2004.\n\n\nUnlike many other students' unions in the UK, it does not have a president, but is run by an eight-member executive team who share joint responsibility.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Manchester people § Sport\n\n![](image)The Manchester University Boat Club is one of many Athletic Union clubs.[93]\n![](image)The Manchester University Boat Club blade\nThe University of Manchester operates sports clubs through its athletics union while student societies are operated by the Students' Union.\n\n\nThe university has more than 80 health and fitness classes while over 3,000 students are members of the 44 various Athletic Union clubs. The sports societies vary widely in their level and scope. Many more popular sports operate several university teams and departmental teams which compete in leagues against other teams within the university. Teams include: badminton, lacrosse, korfball, dodgeball, field hockey, rugby league, rugby union, football, basketball, fencing, netball, squash, water polo, ultimate, and cricket.\n\n\nThe athletic union was formed at Owens College in 1885 from four clubs: rugby, lacrosse, cricket and tennis. In 1901 the women's athletic union was founded. In 1981 the two unions were amalgamated. After the acquisition of the Firs estate in Fallowfield a sports ground and pavilion were provided there. From 1940 the McDougall Centre in Burlington Street was also in use as a sports centre. Ron Hill, Rowena Sweatman, James Hickman, Cyril Holmes and Harry Whittle are former students who have achieved Olympic success.[94]\n\n\nThe Manchester Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool used for the Manchester Commonwealth Games is on the campus and used for water sports. The main facilities used for sports are the Sugden Centre in Grosvenor Street, the Armitage Site near Owens Park and the Wythenshawe Sports Ground.[95]\n\n\nThe university has achieved success in the BUCS (British University & College Sports) competitions, with its men's water polo 1st team winning the national championships (2009, 2010, 2011) under the tutelage of their coach Andy Howard.[96] It was positioned in eighth place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10[97]\n\n\nThe university competes annually in 28 different sports against Leeds and Liverpool universities in the Christie Cup, which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years.[98] The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie's Championships is the oldest Inter–University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of Richard Copley Christie.\n\n\nEvery year elite sportsmen and sportswomen are selected for membership of the *XXI Club*, a society formed in 1932 to promote sporting excellence at the university. Most members have gained a Full Maroon for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level. No more than 21 active members are allowed, each elected for up to three years (after graduating they become passive members).\n\n\nAn example of the university clubs is the lacrosse club which was founded in the season 1883–84 and in the following years won the North of England Flags twice and maintained its position among the leading English clubs. In 1885 it was one of the four founding clubs of the athletic union. The merging of Owens College with the university in 1904 affected the club by restricting the pool of players available for selection. However, when the English Universities Lacrosse Championship was set up in 1925–26 with five university teams the Manchester team won in the first season and again in 1932–33 and continued to do so in the 1930s.[99]\n\n\n\n### *University Challenge* quiz programme[edit]\n\n\nIn the eight years up to 2013, Manchester has won the BBC2 quiz programme *University Challenge* four times, drawing equal with Magdalen College, Oxford, for the highest number of series wins.[100] Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals every year since 2005.[101]\n\n\nIn 2006, Manchester beat Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to record the university's first win in the competition. The next year, the university finished in second place after losing to the University of Warwick in the final. In 2009, the team battled hard in the final against Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At the gong, the score was 275 to 190 in favour of Corpus Christi College after a winning performance from Gail Trimble. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so the team was disqualified.\n\n\nManchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The university did not enter the 2011 series for an unknown reason. However, Manchester did enter a year later and won University Challenge 2012.[101] Manchester has since defended its title to win University Challenge 2013, beating University College London, 190 to 140.\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ashburne Hall, a catered accommodation offered mainly to undergraduate students, though some places are reserved for postgraduate students\nBefore they merged, the two former universities had for some time been sharing their residential facilities.\n\n\n\n#### City Campus[edit]\n\n\nWhitworth Park Halls of Residence is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,085 students,[102][103] located next to Whitworth Park. It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks. Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area. They were built in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dilworth House, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence\nThe site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names of the halls. Grove House is an older building that has been used by the university for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the Manchester University Press.[104] The shops in Thorncliffe Place were part of the same plan and include banks and a convenience store.\nNotable people associated with the halls include Friedrich Engels, whose residence is commemorated by a blue plaque on Aberdeen House; the physicist Brian Cox; and Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International.[105]\n\n\nThe former UMIST Campus has four halls of residence near to Sackville Street building (Weston, Lambert, Fairfield, and Wright Robinson). The Grosvenor Halls of Residence were demolished in 2015 to make way for a new engineering campus.[106] Chandos Hall, a former residence, has been closed and demolished. \n\n\nOther residences include Vaughn House, once the home of the clergy serving the Church of the Holy Name, and George Kenyon Hall at University Place; Crawford House and Devonshire House adjacent to the Manchester Business School and Victoria Hall on Upper Brook Street.\n\n\n\n#### Victoria Park Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hulme Hall, the oldest hall of residence at the university\nThe Victoria Park Campus has several halls of residence including St. Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House) and Opal Gardens Hall. Halls at Victoria Park are generally more traditional, and more likely to be catered.\n\n\nHulme Hall, which opened in 1887 in Plymouth Grove, is the oldest hall of residence at the university. It moved to its current site in Victoria Park in 1907.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Fallowfield Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe Fallowfield Campus, 2 miles (3.2 km) south of the Oxford Road Campus is the largest of the university's residential campuses, built largely in the 1960s as a 'Student Village'. The Owens Park group of halls with a landmark tower is at its centre, while Oak House is another hall of residence. Woolton Hall is next to Oak House. Allen Hall is a traditional hall near Ashburne Hall (Sheavyn House being annexed to Ashburne). Richmond Park is a recent addition to the campus, as well as Unsworth Park which opened in 2019.\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nUCAS Admission Statistics\n|  | 2022\n | 2021\n | 2020\n | 2019\n | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications**[α][16] | 92,310\n | 88,330\n | 79,925\n | 72,300\n | 65,060\n |\n| **Accepted**[α][16] | 9,600\n | 11,070\n | 10,925\n | 8,715\n | 8,425\n |\n| **Applications/Accepted Ratio**[α] | 9.6\n | 8.0\n | 7.3\n | 8.3\n | 7.7\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)**[β][108] | 51.5\n | 60.2\n | 59.7\n | 61.9\n | 59.9\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[109] | —\n | 167\n | 165\n | 165\n | 167\n |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Main scheme applications, International and UK\n2. **^** UK domiciled applicants\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[110] and Ethnicity[111] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 42%\n | 42 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| International EU | 5%\n | 5 |\n| International Non-EU | 34%\n | 34 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[112][113] |\n| Female | 55%\n | 55 |\n| Private School | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 9%\n | 9 |\n\n\nMore students apply to Manchester than to any other university in the country, with 79,925 UCAS main scheme applications for undergraduate courses in 2020.[114] Manchester had the 16th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2019, with new students averaging 165 UCAS points, equivalent to 3/8th of a grade below A\\*A\\*A\\* in A-level grades.[115] In 2020, the university made offers to 59.7% of applicants, with 11.3% of applicants being accepted.[116]\n\n\n15.7% of Manchester's undergraduates are privately educated, the 23rd highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.[117] 49.9% of international students enrolled at the institution are from China, the fifth highest proportion out of all mainstream universities in the UK.[118]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Manchester people\n\nMany notable people have worked or studied at the University of Manchester, or its predecessor institutions, including 25 Nobel Prize laureates. Some of the best-known scientists are: John Dalton (founder of modern atomic theory), Ernest Rutherford who proved the nuclear nature of the atom whilst working at Manchester, Ludwig Wittgenstein (considered one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century, who studied for a doctorate in engineering), George E. Davis (founder of the discipline of chemical engineering), Alan Turing (a founder of computer science and AI, and notable figure in gay rights history), Marie Stopes (pioneer of birth control and campaigner for women's rights), Bernard Lovell (a pioneer of radio astronomy), Tom Kilburn and Frederic Calland Williams (who developed the Manchester Baby, the world's first stored-program computer at Victoria University of Manchester in 1948), and physicist and television presenter Brian Cox.\n\n\nNotable politicians and public figures associated with the university include: two current presidents - Michael D Higgins of the Republic of Ireland and Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania - and two current prime ministers - Abdalla Hamdok of Sudan and Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda - as well as several ministers in the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Chaim Weizmann, a senior lecturer at the university, was the first president of Israel. Irene Khan is a former secretary general of Amnesty International). \n\n\nIn the arts, alumni include: the author Anthony Burgess and Robert Bolt (two times Academy Award winner and three times Golden Globe winner for writing the screenplay for *Lawrence of Arabia* and *Doctor Zhivago*). A number of well-known actors have studied at the university, including Benedict Cumberbatch, who most notably portrays Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sherlock Holmes in the TV series *Sherlock*, as well as playing the role of Manchester's own Alan Turing in the 2014 Oscar-winning biopic *The Imitation Game.* The university also educated some of the leading figures of Alternative Comedy: Ben Elton, Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall.\n\n\n\n### Nobel Prize winners[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester, inclusive of its predecessor institutions, numbers 25 Nobel Prize recipients amongst its current and former staff and students, with some of the most important discoveries of the modern age having been made in Manchester.

The main campus is south of Manchester City Centre on Oxford Road. The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the Manchester Museum, The Whitworth art gallery, the John Rylands Library, the Tabley House Collection and the Jodrell Bank Observatory – a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[9][10] The University of Manchester is considered a red brick university, a product of the civic university movement of the late 19th century. The current University of Manchester was formed in 2004 following the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and the Victoria University of Manchester.[11][12] This followed a century of the two institutions working closely with one another.[13]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology had its origins in the Mechanics' Institute, which was founded in 1824. The present University of Manchester considers this date, which is also the date of foundation of the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, one of the predecessor institutions of the Victoria University of Manchester, as its official foundation year, as indicated in its crest and logo. The founders of the institute believed that all professions somewhat relied on scientific principles. As such, the institute taught working individuals branches of science applicable to their existing occupations. They believed that the practical application of science would encourage innovation and advancements within those trades and professions.[14] The Victoria University of Manchester was founded in 1851, as Owens College. Academic research undertaken by the university was published via the Manchester University Press from 1904.[15]\n\n\nManchester is the third-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and receives over 92,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the most popular university in the UK by volume of applications.[16] The University of Manchester is a member of the Russell Group, the N8 Group, and the US-based Universities Research Association. The University of Manchester, inclusive of its predecessor institutions, has had 25 Nobel laureates amongst its past and present students and staff, the fourth-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins (1824 to 2004)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: UMIST and Victoria University of Manchester\n\n![](image)The Old Quadrangle at the University of Manchester's main campus on Oxford Road\nThe University of Manchester traces its roots to the formation of the Mechanics' Institute (later UMIST) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester's pride in being the world's first industrial city.[17] The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics' Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science.\n\n\nJohn Owens, a textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (around £5.6 million in 2005 prices)[18] to found a college to educate men on non-sectarian lines. His trustees established Owens College in 1851 in a house on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist Richard Cobden, and subsequently housed Manchester County Court. The locomotive designer Charles Beyer became a governor of the college and was the largest single donor to the college extension fund, which raised the money to move to a new site and construct the main building now known as the John Owens building. He also campaigned and helped fund the engineering chair, the first applied science department in the north of England. He left the college the equivalent of £10 million in his will in 1876, at a time when it was in great financial difficulty. Beyer funded the total cost of construction of the Beyer Building to house the biology and geology departments. His will also funded Engineering chairs and the Beyer Professor of Applied mathematics.\n\n\nThe university has a rich German heritage. The Owens College Extension Movement formed their plans after a tour of mainly German universities and polytechnics.[19][20] A Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement, had studied at Heidelberg University. Sir Henry Roscoe also studied at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen and they collaborated for many years on research projects. Roscoe promoted the German style of research-led teaching that became the role model for the red-brick universities. Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic. There were many Germans on the staff, including Carl Schorlemmer, Britain's first chair in organic chemistry, and Arthur Schuster, professor of physics.[21] There was even a German chapel on the campus.\n\n\nIn 1873, Owens College moved to new premises on Oxford Road, Chorlton-on-Medlock, and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University. This university was established and granted a royal charter in 1880, becoming England's first civic university; following Liverpool and Leeds becoming independent, it was renamed the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year.[22]\n\n\nBy 1905, the two institutions were large and active forces. The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester's Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together.[23] However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees. A decade later the development was reversed.[6] The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.[24][25]\n\n\nBefore the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students, with two further Nobel laureates being subsequently added. Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world's first electronic stored-program computer was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre. The author Anthony Burgess, Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize-winning architect Norman Foster and composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked at, Manchester.\n\n\n\n### Post-merger (2004 to present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sackville Street Building, formerly the UMIST Main Building\nThe current University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when Queen Elizabeth II bestowed its royal charter.[26] The university was named the *Sunday Times* University of the Year in 2006 after winning the inaugural *Times Higher Education Supplement* University of the Year prize in 2005.[27]\n\n\nThe founding president and vice-chancellor of the new university was Alan Gilbert, former vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who retired at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year.[28] His successor was Dame Nancy Rothwell,[3] who had held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994. One of the university's aims stated in the *Manchester 2015 Agenda* is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert's aim to \"establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance\".[29] In 2011, four Nobel laureates were on its staff: Andre Geim,[30] Konstantin Novoselov,[31] Sir John Sulston and Joseph E. Stiglitz.\n\n\nThe EPSRC announced in February 2012 the formation of the National Graphene Institute. The University of Manchester is the \"single supplier invited to submit a proposal for funding the new £45m institute, £38m of which will be provided by the government\" – (EPSRC & Technology Strategy Board).[32] In 2013, an additional £23 million of funding from European Regional Development Fund was awarded to the institute taking investment to £61 million.[33]\n\n\nIn August 2012, it was announced that the university's Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences had been chosen to be the \"hub\" location for a new BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, as part of a $100 million initiative to create industry-changing materials.[34][35] The centre will be aimed at advancing fundamental understanding and use of materials across a variety of oil and gas industrial applications and will be modelled on a hub and spoke structure, with the hub located at Manchester, and the spokes based at the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.[36]\n\n\nIn 2020 the university saw a series of student rent strikes and protests in opposition to the university's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent levels and living conditions in the university's halls of residence. The protests ended with a negotiated rent reduction.\n\n\nIn 2023, a second rent strike and student protest in opposition to the university's rent price and living conditions in the halls of residence started. The protests included occupations, marches and student's withholding their rent in University accommodation.[37][38][39] The University's response to the protests included using bailiffs to evict occupiers and taking disciplinary action against some occupiers.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the university campus, with all buildings labelled\nThe university's main site contains most of its facilities and is often referred to as the *campus*, however Manchester is not a campus university as the concept is commonly understood. It is centrally located in the city and its buildings are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between.\n\n\nThe campus occupies an area shaped roughly like a boot: the foot of which is aligned roughly south-west to north-east and is joined to the broader southern part of the boot by an area of overlap between former UMIST and former VUM buildings;[42] it comprises two parts:\n\n\n\n* *North campus* or *Sackville Street Campus*, centred on Sackville Street in Manchester\n* *South campus* or *Oxford Road Campus*, centred on Oxford Road.\n\n\nThe names are not officially recognised by the university, but are commonly used, including in parts of its website and roughly correspond to the campuses of the old UMIST and Victoria University respectively.\n\n\nFallowfield Campus is the main residential campus in Fallowfield, approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) south of the main site.\n\n\nThere are other university buildings across the city and the wider region, such as Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire and One Central Park in Moston, a collaboration between the university and other partners which offers office space for start-up firms and venues for conferences and workshops,[43]\n\n\n\n### Major projects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The atrium inside the £38m Manchester Institute of Biotechnology\nFollowing the merger, the university embarked on a £600 million programme of capital investment, to deliver eight new buildings and 15 major refurbishment projects by 2010, partly financed by a sale of unused assets.[44] These include:\n\n\n\n* £60 m Flagship *University Place* building (new build)\n* £56 m Alan Turing Building houses Mathematics, replaced Mathematics Tower. Home to the Photon Sciences Institute and the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (new build)\n* £50 m Life Sciences Research Building (A. V. Hill Building) (new build)\n* £38 m Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB) (new build)\n* £33 m Life Sciences and Medical and Human Sciences Building (Michael Smith Building) (new build)\n* £31 m Humanities Building – now officially called the \"Arthur Lewis Building\" (new build)\n* £20 m Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre (WMIC) (new build)\n* £18 m Re-location of School of Pharmacy\n* £17 m John Rylands Library, Deansgate (extension & refurbishment of existing building)\n* £13 m Chemistry Building\n* £10 m Functional Biology Building\n* £350 m Manchester Engineering Campus Development (will be formally opened to students in September 2022, new build)\n\n\n### Old Quadrangle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The buildings of the University of Manchester and the Manchester Museum in Oxford Road\nThe buildings around the Old Quadrangle date from the time of Owens College, and were designed in a Gothic style by Alfred Waterhouse and his son Paul Waterhouse. The first to be built was the John Owens Building (1873), formerly the Main Building; the others were added over the next thirty years. Today, the museum continues to occupy part of one side, including the tower. The grand setting of the Whitworth Hall is used for the conferment of degrees, and part of the old Christie Library (1898) now houses Christie's Bistro. The remainder of the buildings house administrative departments. The less easily accessed Rear Quadrangle, dating mostly from 1873, is older in its completed form than the Old Quadrangle.\n\n\n\n### Contact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Contact Theatre\nMain article: Contact Theatre\n\nContact stages modern live performance for all ages, and participatory workshops primarily for young people aged 13 to 30. The building on Devas Street was completed in 1999 incorporating parts of its 1960s predecessor.[45] It has a unique energy-efficient ventilation system, using its high towers to naturally ventilate the building without the use of air conditioning. The colourful and curvaceous interior houses three performance spaces, a lounge bar and *Hot Air*, a reactive public artwork in the foyer.\n\n\n\n### Other notable buildings[edit]\n\n\nOther notable buildings in the Oxford Road Campus include the Stephen Joseph Studio, a former German Protestant church and the Samuel Alexander Building, a grade II listed building[46] erected in 1919 and home of the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures.\n\n\nIn the Sackville Street Campus is the Sackville Street Building which was formerly UMIST's \"Main Building\". It was opened in 1902 by the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour.[47] Built using Burmantofts terracotta, the building is now Grade II listed. It was extended along Whitworth Street, towards London Road, between 1927 and 1957 by the architects Bradshaw Gass & Hope, completion being delayed due to the depression in the 1930s and the Second World War.\n\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Faculties and schools[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester was divided into four faculties, but from 1 August 2016 it was restructured into three faculties, each sub-divided into schools.\n\n\nOn 25 June 2015, the University of Manchester announced the results of a review of the position of life sciences as a separate faculty. As a result of this review the Faculty of Life Sciences was to be dismantled, most of its personnel to be incorporated into a single medical/biological faculty, with a substantial minority being incorporated into a science and engineering faculty.\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Medical School on Coupland Street (photographed in 1908), which now houses the School of Dentistry\nThe faculty is divided into the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medical Sciences and the School of Health Sciences.\n\n\nBiological Sciences have been taught at Manchester as far back as the foundation of Owens College in 1851. At UMIST, biological teaching and research began in 1959, with the creation of a Biochemistry department.[48] The present school, though unitary for teaching, is divided into a number of sections for research purposes.\n\n\nThe medical college was established in 1874 and is one of the largest in the country,[49] with more than 400 medical students trained in each clinical year and more than 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years. The university is a founding partner of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester.[50] In November 2018, Expertscape recognized it as one of the top ten institutions worldwide in COPD research and treatment.[51]\n\n\nIn 1883, a department of pharmacy was established at the university and, in 1904, Manchester became the first British university to offer an honours degree in the subject. The School of Pharmacy[52] benefits from links with Manchester Royal Infirmary and Wythenshawe and Hope hospitals providing its undergraduate students with hospital experience.[53]\n\n\nManchester Dental School was rated the country's best dental school by *Times Higher Education* in 2010 and 2011[54] and it is one of the best funded because of its emphasis on research and enquiry-based learning approach. The university has obtained multimillion-pound backing to maintain its high standard of dental education.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Science and Engineering[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Grade I listed Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory\nThe Faculty of Science and Engineering is divided into two schools. The School of Engineering comprises the departments of: Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Mechanical, Aerospace and Civil Engineering. The School of Natural Sciences comprises the departments of: Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Physics and Astronomy, Materials and Mathematics.\n\n\nThe Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics comprises the university's astronomical academic staff in Manchester and Jodrell Bank Observatory on rural land near Goostrey, about ten miles (16 km) west of Macclesfield. The observatory's Lovell Telescope is named after Sir Bernard Lovell, a professor at the Victoria University of Manchester who first proposed the telescope. Constructed in the 1950s, it is the third largest fully movable radio telescope in the world. It has played an important role in the research of quasars, pulsars and gravitational lenses, and in confirming Einstein's theory of General Relativity.\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Humanities[edit]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Humanities includes the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures (incorporating Archaeology; Art History & Visual Studies; Classics and Ancient History; Drama; English and American Studies; History; Linguistics; Modern Languages; Museology; Music; Religions and Theology and the University Language Centre) and the Schools of Combined Studies; Education; Environment and Development; Architecture; Law; Social Sciences and the Manchester Business School. The Faculty of Humanities also jointly administers the Manchester School of Architecture (MSA) in conjunction with Manchester Metropolitan University and MSA students are classified as students of both universities.\n\n\nAdditionally, the faculty comprises a number of research institutes: the Centre for New Writing, the Institute for Social Change, the Brooks World Poverty Institute, Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute, the Manchester Institute for Innovation Research, the Research Institute for Cosmopolitan Cultures, the Centre for Chinese Studies, the Institute for Development Policy and Management, the Centre for Equity in Education and the Sustainable Consumption Institute.\n\n\n\n![](image)The university's Whitworth Hall\n![](image)Whitworth Hall interior\n### Professional services[edit]\n\n\nA number of professional services, organised as \"directorates\", support the university. These include: Directorate of Compliance and Risk, Directorate of Estates and Facilities, Directorate of Finance, Directorate of Planning, Directorate of Human Resources, Directorate of IT Services, Directorate of Legal Affairs and Board Secretariat and Governance Office, Directorate of Research and Business Engagement, Directorate for the Student Experience, Division of Communications and Marketing, Division of Development and Alumni Relations, Office for Social Responsibility and the University Library. Additionally, professional services staff are found within the faculty structure, in such roles as technician and experimental officer.\n\n\nEach directorate reports to the registrar, secretary and chief operating officer, who in turn reports to the president of the university. There is also a director of faculty operations in each faculty, overseeing support for these areas.[56]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2011, the University of Manchester had a total income of £808.58 million (2009/10 – £787.9 million) and total expenditure of £754.51 million (2009/10 – £764.55 million).[1] Key sources of income included £247.28 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2009/10 – £227.75 million), £203.22 million from funding body grants (2009/10 – £209.02 million), £196.24 million from research grants and contracts (2009/10 – £194.6 million) and £14.84 million from endowment and investment income (2009/10 – £11.38 million).[1] During the 2010/11 financial year the University of Manchester had a capital expenditure of £57.42 million (2009/10 – £37.95 million).[1]\n\n\nAt year end the University of Manchester had endowments of £158.7 million (2009/10 – £144.37 million) and total net assets of £731.66 million (2009/10 – £677.12 million).[1]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester is the 3rd largest university in the UK (following The Open University and University College London).[57] The University of Manchester attracts international students from 160 countries around the world.[58]\n\n\nWell-known members of the university's current academic staff include computer scientist Steve Furber, economist Richard Nelson,[59] novelist Jeanette Winterson[60] and biochemist Sir John Sulston, Nobel Prize laureate of 2002.\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester is a major centre for research and a member of the Russell Group of leading British research universities.[61] In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and eighth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (tenth when including specialist institutions).[62][63] In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and fifteenth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (seventeenth when including specialist institutions).[64][65] Manchester has the sixth largest research income of any English university (after Oxford, University College London (UCL), Cambridge, Imperial and King's College London),[66] and has been informally referred to as part of a \"golden diamond\" of research-intensive UK institutions (adding Manchester to the Oxford–Cambridge–London \"Golden Triangle\").[67] Manchester has a strong record in terms of securing funding from the three main UK research councils, EPSRC, MRC and BBSRC, being ranked fifth,[68] seventh[69] and first[70] respectively. In addition, the university is one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: an estimate in 2008 placed it third, surpassed only by Oxford and Cambridge.[71]\n\n\nThe University of Manchester has attracted the most research income from UK industry of any institution in the country. The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), show that Manchester attracted £24,831,000 of research income in 2016–2017 from UK industry, commerce and public corporations.[72]\n\n\nHistorically, Manchester has been linked with high scientific achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the third largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford and Cambridge) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill).[73] The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more than any other in the UK.[74] The Langworthy Professorship, an endowed chair at the university's Department of Physics and Astronomy, has been historically given to a long line of academic luminaries, including Ernest Rutherford (1907–19), Lawrence Bragg (1919–37), Patrick Blackett (1937–53) and more recently Konstantin Novoselov, all of whom have won the Nobel Prize. In 2013 Manchester was given the Regius Professorship in Physics, the only one of its kind in the UK; the current holder is Andre Geim.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Grade-I listed John Rylands Library on Deansgate\nMain article: University of Manchester Library\n\nThe University of Manchester Library is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK and the third-largest academic library after those of Oxford and Cambridge.[75] It has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK.[75]\n\n\nThe John Rylands Library, founded in memory of John Rylands by his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands as an independent institution, is situated in a Victorian Gothic building on Deansgate, in the city centre. It houses an important collection of historic books and other printed materials, manuscripts, including archives and papyri. The papyri are in ancient languages and include the oldest extant New Testament document, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, commonly known as the *St John Fragment*. In April 2007 the Deansgate site reopened to readers and the public after major improvements and renovations, including the construction of the pitched roof originally intended and a new wing.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n#### Manchester Museum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the Manchester Museum\nMain article: Manchester Museum\n\nThe Manchester Museum holds nearly 4.25 million[76] items sourced from many parts of the world. The collections include butterflies and carvings from India, birds and bark-cloth from the Pacific, live frogs and ancient pottery from America, fossils and native art from Australia, mammals and ancient Egyptian craftsmanship from Africa, plants, coins and minerals from Europe, art from past civilisations of the Mediterranean, and beetles, armour and archery from Asia. In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised *Tyrannosaurus rex* called \"Stan\".\n\n\nThe museum's first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of Natural History, and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society. Due to the society's financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London's Natural History Museum, to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public. The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Whitworth Art Gallery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Whitworth Art Gallery\n\n![](image)The Whitworth Art Gallery\nThe Whitworth Art Gallery houses collections of internationally known British watercolours, textiles and wallpapers, modern and historic prints, drawings, paintings and sculpture. Its collection contains 31,000 items. A programme of temporary exhibitions runs throughout the year and the Mezzanine Court displays sculpture.\n\n\nThe gallery was founded by Robert Darbishire with a donation from Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1889, as *The Whitworth Institute and Park*. In 1959, the gallery became part of the Victoria University of Manchester.[78] In October 1995, the Mezzanine Court in the centre of the building was opened. It was designed to display sculptures and won a RIBA regional award.[79]\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[80] | 19 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[81] | 24 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[82] | 23 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[83] | 41 |\n| *QS* (2025)[84] | 32 |\n| *THE* (2024)[85] | 51 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Manchester's national league table performance over the past ten years\nAccording to the 2020 Graduate Market Review published by High Fliers, Manchester is the most targeted university by the top 100 graduate employers in the UK.[86]\n\n\nAs of 2021, the University of Manchester has been recognised as the 27th best university in the world by QS. The university was ranked 6th nationally. The University of Manchester was ranked 36th in the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020. It had the 5th highest ranking of UK universities on this list. In 2019, the university placed 4th nationally in Reuters' list of the World's Most Innovative Universities.[87]\n\n\nAccording to *The Sunday Times* in 2006, \"Manchester has a formidable reputation spanning most disciplines, but most notably in the life sciences, engineering, humanities, economics, sociology and the social sciences\".[88] Manchester was given a prestigious award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts by the *Times Higher Education Awards 2010*.[89]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Alliance Manchester Business School was ranked 3rd in UK, 10th in Europe and 30th in the world by the *Financial Times* in its global MBA ranking.[90]\n\n\nHowever, while world rankings (such as QS, ARWU, THE) typically place the university within the top 10 in the UK, the university ranks slightly less favourably in national studies. 'The Complete University Guide 2022' ranked Manchester 13th out of universities in the UK, and ‘The Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide 2021' placed it at 18th.[87] A 2016 poll voted Manchester as the third \"most underrated university in the UK\".[91]\n\n\nIn 2022, the University of Manchester was ranked at number 38 in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).\n\n\nDeputy President and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Luke Georgiou, said: “The ranking tables, despite their limitations, give a consistent picture of The University of Manchester’s excellence in national and global terms.”[92]\n\n\n\n### Manchester University Press[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Manchester University Press\n\nManchester University Press is the university's academic publishing house. It publishes academic monographs, textbooks and journals, most of which are works from authors based elsewhere in the international academic community, and is the third-largest university press in England after Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press.\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students' Union[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Students' Union building on Oxford Road\nMain article: University of Manchester Students' Union\n\nThe University of Manchester Students' Union is the representative body of students at the university and the UK's largest students' union. It was formed out of the merger between UMIST Students' Association and University of Manchester Union when the parent organisations UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester merged on 1 October 2004.\n\n\nUnlike many other students' unions in the UK, it does not have a president, but is run by an eight-member executive team who share joint responsibility.\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of University of Manchester people § Sport\n\n![](image)The Manchester University Boat Club is one of many Athletic Union clubs.[93]\n![](image)The Manchester University Boat Club blade\nThe University of Manchester operates sports clubs through its athletics union while student societies are operated by the Students' Union.\n\n\nThe university has more than 80 health and fitness classes while over 3,000 students are members of the 44 various Athletic Union clubs. The sports societies vary widely in their level and scope. Many more popular sports operate several university teams and departmental teams which compete in leagues against other teams within the university. Teams include: badminton, lacrosse, korfball, dodgeball, field hockey, rugby league, rugby union, football, basketball, fencing, netball, squash, water polo, ultimate, and cricket.\n\n\nThe athletic union was formed at Owens College in 1885 from four clubs: rugby, lacrosse, cricket and tennis. In 1901 the women's athletic union was founded. In 1981 the two unions were amalgamated. After the acquisition of the Firs estate in Fallowfield a sports ground and pavilion were provided there. From 1940 the McDougall Centre in Burlington Street was also in use as a sports centre. Ron Hill, Rowena Sweatman, James Hickman, Cyril Holmes and Harry Whittle are former students who have achieved Olympic success.[94]\n\n\nThe Manchester Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool used for the Manchester Commonwealth Games is on the campus and used for water sports. The main facilities used for sports are the Sugden Centre in Grosvenor Street, the Armitage Site near Owens Park and the Wythenshawe Sports Ground.[95]\n\n\nThe university has achieved success in the BUCS (British University & College Sports) competitions, with its men's water polo 1st team winning the national championships (2009, 2010, 2011) under the tutelage of their coach Andy Howard.[96] It was positioned in eighth place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10[97]\n\n\nThe university competes annually in 28 different sports against Leeds and Liverpool universities in the Christie Cup, which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years.[98] The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie's Championships is the oldest Inter–University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of Richard Copley Christie.\n\n\nEvery year elite sportsmen and sportswomen are selected for membership of the *XXI Club*, a society formed in 1932 to promote sporting excellence at the university. Most members have gained a Full Maroon for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level. No more than 21 active members are allowed, each elected for up to three years (after graduating they become passive members).\n\n\nAn example of the university clubs is the lacrosse club which was founded in the season 1883–84 and in the following years won the North of England Flags twice and maintained its position among the leading English clubs. In 1885 it was one of the four founding clubs of the athletic union. The merging of Owens College with the university in 1904 affected the club by restricting the pool of players available for selection. However, when the English Universities Lacrosse Championship was set up in 1925–26 with five university teams the Manchester team won in the first season and again in 1932–33 and continued to do so in the 1930s.[99]\n\n\n\n### *University Challenge* quiz programme[edit]\n\n\nIn the eight years up to 2013, Manchester has won the BBC2 quiz programme *University Challenge* four times, drawing equal with Magdalen College, Oxford, for the highest number of series wins.[100] Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals every year since 2005.[101]\n\n\nIn 2006, Manchester beat Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to record the university's first win in the competition. The next year, the university finished in second place after losing to the University of Warwick in the final. In 2009, the team battled hard in the final against Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At the gong, the score was 275 to 190 in favour of Corpus Christi College after a winning performance from Gail Trimble. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so the team was disqualified.\n\n\nManchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The university did not enter the 2011 series for an unknown reason. However, Manchester did enter a year later and won University Challenge 2012.[101] Manchester has since defended its title to win University Challenge 2013, beating University College London, 190 to 140.\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ashburne Hall, a catered accommodation offered mainly to undergraduate students, though some places are reserved for postgraduate students\nBefore they merged, the two former universities had for some time been sharing their residential facilities.\n\n\n\n#### City Campus[edit]\n\n\nWhitworth Park Halls of Residence is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,085 students,[102][103] located next to Whitworth Park. It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks. Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area. They were built in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dilworth House, one of the Whitworth Park halls of residence\nThe site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names of the halls. Grove House is an older building that has been used by the university for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the Manchester University Press.[104] The shops in Thorncliffe Place were part of the same plan and include banks and a convenience store.\nNotable people associated with the halls include Friedrich Engels, whose residence is commemorated by a blue plaque on Aberdeen House; the physicist Brian Cox; and Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International.[105]\n\n\nThe former UMIST Campus has four halls of residence near to Sackville Street building (Weston, Lambert, Fairfield, and Wright Robinson). The Grosvenor Halls of Residence were demolished in 2015 to make way for a new engineering campus.[106] Chandos Hall, a former residence, has been closed and demolished. \n\n\nOther residences include Vaughn House, once the home of the clergy serving the Church of the Holy Name, and George Kenyon Hall at University Place; Crawford House and Devonshire House adjacent to the Manchester Business School and Victoria Hall on Upper Brook Street.\n\n\n\n#### Victoria Park Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hulme Hall, the oldest hall of residence at the university\nThe Victoria Park Campus has several halls of residence including St. Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House) and Opal Gardens Hall. Halls at Victoria Park are generally more traditional, and more likely to be catered.\n\n\nHulme Hall, which opened in 1887 in Plymouth Grove, is the oldest hall of residence at the university. It moved to its current site in Victoria Park in 1907.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Fallowfield Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe Fallowfield Campus, 2 miles (3.2 km) south of the Oxford Road Campus is the largest of the university's residential campuses, built largely in the 1960s as a 'Student Village'.

Founded by papal bull in 1451 [O.S. 1450],[5] it is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities. Along with the universities of St Andrews, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century. Glasgow is the largest university in Scotland by total enrolment[3] and with over 19,500 postgraduates the second-largest in the United Kingdom by postgraduate enrolment.[3]\n\n\nIn common with universities of the pre-modern era, Glasgow originally educated students primarily from wealthy backgrounds; however, it became a pioneer[*citation needed*] in British higher education in the 19th century by also providing for the needs of students from the growing urban and commercial middle class. Glasgow University served all of these students by preparing them for professions: law, medicine, civil service, teaching, and the church. It also trained smaller but growing numbers for careers in science and engineering.[6] The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £923.6 million of which £196.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £998.5 million.[1] The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK. It is a member of Universitas 21, the Russell Group[7] and the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities.\n\n\nThe university was originally located in the city's High Street; since 1870, its main campus has been at Gilmorehill in the City's West End.[8] Additionally, a number of university buildings are located elsewhere, such as the Veterinary School in Bearsden, and the Crichton Campus in Dumfries.[9]\n\n\nThe alumni of the University of Glasgow include some of the major figures of modern history, including James Wilson, a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence, 3 Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom (William Lamb, Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Bonar Law), 3 Scottish First Ministers (Humza Yousaf, Nicola Sturgeon and Donald Dewar), economist Adam Smith, philosopher Francis Hutcheson, engineer James Watt, physicist Lord Kelvin, surgeon Joseph Lister along with 4 Nobel Prize laureates (In total 8 Nobel Prize winners are affiliated with the University) and numerous Olympic gold medallists, including the current chancellor, Dame Katherine Granger.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Glasgow was founded in 1451 by a charter or papal bull from Pope Nicholas V, at the suggestion of King James II, giving Bishop William Turnbull, a graduate of the University of St Andrews, permission to add a university to the city's Cathedral.[10] It is the second-oldest university in Scotland after St Andrews and the fourth-oldest in the English-speaking world. The universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen were ecclesiastical foundations, while Edinburgh was a civic foundation. As one of the ancient universities of the United Kingdom, Glasgow is one of only eight institutions to award undergraduate master's degrees in certain disciplines.[11]\n\n\nThe university has been without its original Bull since the mid-sixteenth century. In 1560, during the political unrest accompanying the Scottish Reformation, the then chancellor, Archbishop James Beaton, a supporter of the Marian cause, fled to France. He took with him, for safe-keeping, many of the archives and valuables of the cathedral and the university, including the Mace and the Bull. Although the Mace was sent back in 1590, the archives were not. Principal James Fall told the Parliamentary Commissioners of Visitation on 28 August 1690, that he had seen the Bull at the Scots College in Paris, together with the many charters granted to the university by the monarchs of Scotland from James II to Mary, Queen of Scots. The university enquired of these documents in 1738 but was informed by Thomas Innes and the superiors of the Scots College that the original records of the foundation of the university were not to be found. If they had not been lost by this time, they certainly went astray during the French Revolution when the Scots College was under threat. Its records and valuables were moved for safe-keeping out of the city of Paris. The Bull remains the authority by which the university awards degrees.\n\n\nTeaching at the university began in the Chapter House of Glasgow Cathedral, subsequently moving to nearby Rottenrow, in a building known as the \"Auld Pedagogy\". The university was given 13 acres (5.3 ha) of land belonging to the Black Friars (Dominicans) on High Street by Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1563.[12] By the late 17th century its building centred on two courtyards surrounded by walled gardens, with a clock tower, which was one of the notable features of Glasgow's skyline—reaching 140 feet (43 m) in height[13]—and a chapel adapted from the church of the former Dominican (Blackfriars) friary. Remnants of this Scottish Renaissance building, mainly parts of the main façade, were transferred to the Gilmorehill campus and renamed as the \"Pearce Lodge\", after Sir William Pearce, the shipbuilding magnate who funded its preservation. The Lion and Unicorn Staircase was also transferred from the old college site and is now attached to the Main Building.\n\n\nJohn Anderson, while professor of natural philosophy at the university, and with some opposition from his colleagues, pioneered vocational education for working men and women during the Industrial Revolution. To continue this work in his will, he founded Anderson's College, which was associated with the university before merging with other institutions to become the University of Strathclyde in 1964.\n\n\nIn 1973, Delphine Parrott became its first female professor, as Gardiner Professor of Immunology.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2014, the university court voted for the university to become the first academic institution in Europe to divest from the fossil fuel industry.[15]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Glasgow, Older Building Sign\nThe university is currently spread over a few campuses. The main one is the Gilmorehill campus, in Hillhead. As well as this there is the Garscube Estate in Bearsden, housing the Veterinary School, Observatory, ship model basin and much of the university's sports facilities, the Dental School in the city center, the section of Mental Health and Well Being at Gartnavel Royal Hospital on Great Western Road, the Teaching and Learning Centre at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Crichton Campus in Dumfries (operated jointly by the University of Glasgow, the University of the West of Scotland and the Open University).\n\n\nThe Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) was opened at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on 29 March 2017, including a Clinical Innovation Zone spanning 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) of collaboration space for researchers and industry.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)A model of the old High Street Building, in the Hunterian Museum\n### High Street[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Glasgow in 1650\nThe university's initial accommodation including Glasgow University Library[17][18] was part of the complex of religious buildings in the precincts of Glasgow Cathedral. In 1460, the university received a grant of land from James, Lord Hamilton, on the east side of the High Street,[19] immediately north of the Blackfriars Church, on which it had its home for the next four hundred years. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Hamilton Building was replaced with a very grand two-court building with a decorated west front facing the High Street, called the 'Nova Erectio', or New Building. This foundation is widely considered to have been one of the finest 17th-century buildings in Scotland. Decorated fragments from it, including a complete exterior stairway, were rescued and built into its 19th-century replacement. In Sir Walter Scott's best-selling 1817 novel *Rob Roy*, set at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1715, the lead character fights a duel in the New Building grounds before the contest is broken up by Rob Roy MacGregor.\n\n\nOver the following centuries, the university's size and scope continued to expand. In 1757 it built the Macfarlane Observatory and later Scotland's first public museum, the Hunterian. It was a center of the Scottish Enlightenment and subsequently of the Industrial Revolution, and its expansion in the High Street was constrained. The area around the university declined as well-off residents moved westwards with the expansion of the city and overcrowding of the immediate area by less well-off residents. It was this rapid slumming of the area that was a chief catalyst of the university's migration westward.\n\n\n\n### Gilmorehill[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The new buildings of the University of Glasgow at Gilmorehill, circa 1895.\n![](image)The night view of the university's main building\nIn 1870, the university moved to a (then greenfield) site on Gilmorehill in the West End of the city, around three miles (5 km) west of its previous location, enclosed by a large meander of the River Kelvin. The original site on the High Street was sold to the City of Glasgow Union Railway and replaced by the college goods yard. The new-build campus was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic revival style. The largest of these buildings echoed, on a far grander scale, the original High Street campus's twin-quadrangle layout, and may have been inspired by Ypres' late-medieval cloth hall; Gilmorehill, in turn, inspired the design of the Clocktower complex of buildings for the new University of Otago in New Zealand. In 1879, Gilbert Scott's son, Oldrid, completed this original vision by building an open undercroft forming two quadrangles, above which is his grand Bute Hall (used for examinations and graduation ceremonies), named after its donor, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Oldrid also later added a spire to the building's signature gothic bell tower in 1887, bringing it to a total height of some 85 metres (278 ft).[20] The local Bishopbriggs blond sandstone cladding and Gothic design of the building's exterior belie the modernity of its Victorian construction; Scott's building is structured upon what was then a cutting-edge riveted iron frame construction, supporting a lightweight wooden-beam roof. The building also forms the second-largest example of Gothic revival architecture in Britain, after the Palace of Westminster. An illustration of the Main Building previously featured on the reverse side of £100 notes issued by Clydesdale Bank.[21]\n\n\nThe university's Hunterian Museum resides in the Main Building, and the related Hunterian Gallery is housed in buildings adjacent to the University Library.[22] The latter includes \"The Mackintosh House\", a rebuilt terraced house designed by, and furnished after, architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\n\n\nEven these enlarged premises could not contain the expanding university, which quickly spread across much of Gilmorehill. The 1930s saw the construction of the award-winning round Reading Room (it is now a category-A listed building) and an aggressive program of house purchases, in which the university (fearing the surrounding district of Hillhead was running out of suitable building land) acquired several terraces of Victorian houses and joined them together internally. The departments of Psychology, Computing Science, and most of the Arts Faculty continue to be housed in these terraces.\n\n\n\n![](image)The School of History building occupies what were formerly townhouses on University Avenue.\nMore buildings were built to the west of the Main Building, developing the land between University Avenue and the River Kelvin with natural science buildings and the faculty of medicine. The medical school spread into neighboring Partick and joined with the Western Infirmary. At the eastern flank of the Main Building, the James Watt Engineering Building was completed in 1959. The growth and prosperity of the city, which had originally forced the university's relocation to Hillhead, again proved problematic when more real estate was required. The school of veterinary medicine, which was founded in 1862, moved to a new campus in the leafy surrounds of Garscube Estate, around two miles (3 km) west of the main campus, in 1954. The university later moved its sports ground and associated facilities to Garscube and also built student halls of residence in both Garscube and Maryhill.\n\n\nThe expected growth of tertiary education in the 1960s following publication of the Robbins Report led the university to build numerous modern buildings across Hillhead in a development zone, originally comprising mainly residential tenements, that had been designated on the north side of University Avenue in 1945.[23][24] Several of these new buildings were in the brutalist style; the Mathematics Building at the west end of University Avenue (opened 1968, demolished 2017),[23] the Rankine Building at the east end of University Avenue (opened 1970),[25] the multipurpose Adam Smith Building (opened 1967)[26] on the crest of the hill above University Gardens, and the new Queen Margaret Union building (opened 1968) on the University Gardens site previously occupied by the University Observatory.[27] These were joined by others in various modernist styles; both the Library and Boyd Orr Building (opened 1968 and 1972 respectively)[24][28] were configured as tower blocks, as was the Genetics Building at the very south end of the campus on Dumbarton Road (opened 1967, named for Guido Pontecorvo in 1994, demolished 2021),[29] while the amber-brick Geology Building (opened 1980, named for John Walter Gregory in 1998, renamed for Silas Molema in 2021) was built to a low-rise design on the former site of eight terraced houses in Lilybank Gardens.[30]\n\n\nTo further cater to the expanding student population, a new refectory – known as the Hub – was opened adjacent to the library in 1966, and the Glasgow University Union building at the eastern end of University Avenue was extended in 1965.\n\n\nIn October 2001 the century-old Bower Building (previously home to the university's botany department) was gutted by fire. The interior and roof of the building were largely destroyed, though the main façade remained intact. After a £10.8 million refit, the building re-opened in November 2004.\n\n\nThe Wolfson Medical School Building, with its award-winning glass-fronted atrium, opened in 2002,[31] and in 2003, the St Andrews Building was opened, housing the what is now the School of Education. It is sited a short walk from Gilmorehill, in the Woodlands area of the city on the site of the former Queens College, which had in turn been bought by Glasgow Caledonian University, from whom the university acquired the site. It replaced the St Andrews Campus in Bearsden. The university also procured the former Hillhead Congregational Church, converting it into a lecture theatre in 2005. The Sir Alwyn Williams building, designed by Reiach and Hall, was completed at Lilybank Terrace in 2007, housing the School of Computing Science.\n\n\nIn September 2016, in partnership with Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Life, and the National Library of Scotland, the transformed Kelvin Hall was brought into new public use including in Phase I the Hunterian Collections and Study Centre.[32]\n\n\nThe Mathematics Building, on University Way adjacent to the Boyd Orr Building, was demolished in 2017 to make way for a new 'Learning Hub' intended to provide individual and group study spaces for more than 2,500 students, as well as a 500-seat lecture theatre. Built at a cost of £90.6 million, it opened in April 2021 and is named for James McCune Smith, the first African American to earn a degree in medicine and a University of Glasgow alumnus.[33][34] A further investment of over £900 million is being made across the Gilmorehill campus, focused mainly on redeveloping the 5.7-hectare (14-acre) site between University Avenue and Dumbarton Road that was occupied by the Western Infirmary between 1874 and 2015.[34][35]\n\n\n\n#### Chapel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Glasgow Memorial Chapel\n\n![](image)Interior of the Chapel\nThe University Chapel was constructed as a memorial to the 755 sons of the university who had died in the First World War. Designed by Sir John Burnet, it was completed in 1929 and dedicated on 4 October. Tablets on the wall behind the Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the university community who gave their lives in the Second World War. Most of the windows are the work of Douglas Strachan, although some have been added over the years, including those on the South Wall, created by Alan Younger.\n\n\nDaily services are held in the chapel during term-time, as well as seasonal events. Before Christmas, there is a Service of Nine Lessons and Carols on the last Sunday of term, and a Watchnight service on Christmas Eve. Graduates, students, members of staff, and the children of members of staff are entitled to be married in the chapel, which is also used for baptisms and funerals. Civil marriages and civil partnerships may be blessed in the chapel, although under UK law may not be performed there.[*verification needed*]\n\n\nThe current chaplain of the university is the Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie, and the university appoints honorary chaplains of other denominations.\n\n\n\n#### Library and archives[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Glasgow University Library\n\n![](image)The university's library hosts over three million volumes.[36]\nThe University Library, situated on Hillhead Street opposite the Main Building, is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Europe. Situated over 12 floors, it hosts more than three million books and journals, as well as providing access to an extensive range of electronic resources including over 51,900 electronic journals. It also houses sections for periodicals, microfilms, special collections and rare materials.[37] Open between 7 a.m. and 2 a.m., 361 days of the year, the library provides a resource not only for the academic community.\n\n\nIn addition to the main library, subject libraries also exist for Medicine, Chemistry, Dental Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Education, Law, History of Art, and the faculty of Social Sciences, which are held in branch libraries around the campus.[38] In 2007, a state-of-the-art section to house the library's collection of historic photographs was opened, funded by the Wolfson Foundation.[38]\n\n\nThe Archives of the University of Glasgow is the central place of deposit for the records of the university, created and accumulated since its foundation in 1451.\n\n\n\n### Crichton campus, Dumfries[edit]\n\n\nThe university opened the Crichton campus in Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway during the 1980s. It was designed to meet the needs for tertiary education in an area far from major cities and is operated jointly by the University of Glasgow, the University of the West of Scotland and the Open University. It offers a modular undergraduate curriculum, leading to one of a small number of liberal arts degrees, as well as providing the region's only access to postgraduate study.[39]\n\n\n\n### Non-teaching facilities[edit]\n\n\nAs well as these teaching campuses the university has halls of residence in and around the North-West of the city, accommodating a total of approximately 3,500 students.[40] These include the Murano Street halls in Maryhill; Wolfson halls on the Garscube Estate; Queen Margaret halls, in Kelvinside; Cairncross House and Kelvinhaugh Gate, in Yorkhill. In recent years, Dalrymple House and Horslethill halls in Dowanhill, Reith halls in North Kelvinside and the Maclay halls in Park Circus (near Kelvingrove Park), have closed and been sold, as the development value of such property increased.\n\n\nThe Stevenson Building on Gilmorehill opened in 1961 and provides students with the use of a fitness suite, squash courts, sauna, and six-lane, 25-metre swimming pool. The university also has a large sports complex on the Garscube Estate, besides their Wolfson Halls and Vet School. This is a new facility, replacing the previous *Westerlands* sports ground in the Anniesland area of the city. The university also has use of half of the East Boathouse situated at Glasgow Green on the River Clyde where Glasgow University Boat Club train.\n\n\n\n## Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A block of buildings in Gilmorehill campus\nFurther information: Ancient university governance in Scotland\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland the university's constitution is laid out in the Universities (Scotland) Acts. These Acts create a tripartite structure of bodies: the University Court (governing body), the Academic Senate (academic affairs), and the General Council (advisory). There is also a clear separation between governance and executive administration.\n\n\nThe university's constitution, academic regulations, and appointments are described in the university calendar,[41] while other aspects of its story and constitution are detailed in a separate \"history\" document.[42]\n\n\n\n### Officers[edit]\n\n\nThere are several officers of the university. The role of each involves the management of the operations of Glasgow.\n\n\n\n#### Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chancellor of the University of Glasgow\n\nThe Chancellor is the titular head of the university and President of the General Council. They award all degrees, although this duty is generally carried out by the Vice-Chancellor, appointed by them.\n\n\nThe current Chancellor is Dame Katherine Grainger, a former rower who is Britain's most decorated female Olympian, the current chair of UK Sport, and former Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University. She is an alumna of the university, with a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Medical Law and Medical Ethics. She is the first woman to hold the office in the university.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rector of the University of Glasgow\n\nAll students at the university are eligible to vote in the election of the Rector (officially styled \"Lord Rector\"), who holds office for a three-year term and chairs the University Court. In the past, this position has been a largely honorary and ceremonial one, and has been held by political figures including William Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, Bonar Law, Robert Peel, Raymond Poincaré, Arthur Balfour, Charles Kennedy and 1970s union activist Jimmy Reid, and latterly by celebrities such as TV presenters Arthur Montford and Johnny Ball, musician Pat Kane, and actors Richard Wilson, Ross Kemp and Greg Hemphill. In 2004, for the first time in its history, the university was left without a Rector as no nominations were received. When the elections were run in December, Mordechai Vanunu was chosen for the post,[43] even though he was unable to attend due to restrictions placed upon him by the Israeli government. In 2014, Edward Snowden, an American computer specialist, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor—who came to international attention when he disclosed a large number of classified NSA documents to several media outlets—was elected.[44] In 2017, Aamer Anwar a Scottish lawyer and former student of the university was elected rector [45] until 2020 when rector elections had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 21, 2021, Rita Rae, Lady Rae a Scottish lawyer, judge and former Senator of the College of Justice was appointed Rector after a decisive victory.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Principal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Principal of the University of Glasgow\n\nDay-to-day management of the university is undertaken by the University Principal (who is also Vice-Chancellor). The current principal is Sir Anton Muscatelli who replaced Sir Muir Russell in October 2009.[48]\n\n\nThere are also several Vice-Principals, each with a specific remit. They, along with the Clerk of Senate, play a major role in the day-to-day management of the university.\n\n\n\n### University Court[edit]\n\n\nThe governing body of the university is the University Court, which is responsible for contractual matters, employing staff, and all other matters relating to finance and administration. The Court takes decisions about the deployment of resources as well as formulating strategic plans for the university. The Court is chaired by the Rector, who is elected by all the matriculated students at the university. The University Secretary is the Head of University Services and assists the Principal in day-to-day management. The current University Secretary is David Duncan.[49]\n\n\n\n### Academic Senate[edit]\n\n\nThe Academic Senate (or University Senate) is the body which is responsible for the management of academic affairs, and which recommends the conferment of degrees by the Chancellor. Membership of the Senate comprises all Professors of the university, as well as elected academic members, representatives of the Student's Representative Council, the Secretary of Court and directors of university services (e.g. Library). The President of the Senate is the principal.\n\n\nThe Clerk of Senate, who has a status equivalent to that of a Vice-Principal and is a member of the Senior Management Group, has responsibility for regulation of the university's academic policy, such as dealing with plagiarism and the conduct of examinations. Notable Clerks of Senate have included the chemist, Joseph Black; John Anderson, father of the University of Strathclyde; and the economist, John Millar.\n\n\n\n### Committees[edit]\n\n\nThere are also a number of committees of both the Court and Senate that make important decisions and investigate matters referred to them. As well as these bodies there is a General Council made up of the university graduates that is involved in the running of the university. The graduates also elect the Chancellor of the university.\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently four Colleges, each containing a number of Schools. They are:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **College of Arts & Humanities**\n* ArtsLab Glasgow\n* Graduate School of the College of Arts & Humanities\n* School of Critical Studies\n* School of Culture and Creative Arts\n* School of Humanities\n* School of Modern Languages and Cultures\n\n**College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences**\n* School of Biodiversity, One Health & Veterinary Medicine\n* School of Cancer Sciences\n* School of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Health\n* School of Health & Wellbeing\n* School of Infection & Immunity\n* School of Medicine, Dentistry & Nursing\n* School of Molecular Biosciences\n* School of Psychology & Neuroscience\n | **College of Science and Engineering**\n* School of Chemistry\n* School of Computing Science\n* James Watt School of Engineering\n* School of Geographical and Earth Sciences\n* School of Mathematics & Statistics\n* School of Physics and Astronomy\n\n**College of Social Sciences**\n* Adam Smith Business School\n* School of Education\n* School of Social & Environmental Sustainability (at Crichton Campus, Dumfries)\n* School of Law\n* School of Social & Political Sciences\n\n\n |\n\n![](image)Adam Smith lends his name to the business school\nAt the university's foundation in 1451, there were four original faculties: Arts, Divinity, Law, and Medicine. The Faculty of Divinity became a constituent school of the Faculty of Arts in 2002,[50] while the Faculty of Law was changed in 1984 into the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies, and in 2005 became the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences.[51] Although one of the original faculties established, teaching in the Faculty of Medicine did not begin formally until 1714, with the revival of the Chair in the Practice of Medicine.[52] The Faculty of Science was formed in 1893 from Chairs removed from the Faculties of Arts and Medicine, and subsequently divided in 2000 to form the three Faculties of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Computing Science, Mathematics and Statistics (now Information and Mathematical Sciences) and Physical Sciences.[53] The Faculty of Social Sciences was formed from Chairs in the Faculty of Arts in 1977, and merged to form the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences in 2005, the two having operated as a single 'resource unit' since 2002.[54] The Faculty of Engineering was formally established in 1923, although engineering had been taught at the university since 1840 when Queen Victoria founded the UK's first Chair of Engineering. Through a concordat ratified in 1913,[55] Royal Technical College (later Royal College of Science and Technology and now University of Strathclyde) students received Glasgow degrees in applied sciences, particularly engineering. It was in 1769 when James Watt's engineering at Glasgow led to a stable steam engine and, subsequently, the Industrial Revolution. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was established in 1862 as the independent Glasgow Veterinary College, being subsumed into the university in 1949 and gaining independent Faculty status in 1969.[56] The Faculty of Education was formed when the university merged with St Andrew's College of Education in 1999.[57][58] St Andrew's College of Education was formed in 1981 through the merger of two Catholic colleges: Notre Dame College of Education, Glasgow, founded in 1895 and Craiglockhart College of Education, Edinburgh, founded in 1920.[59]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2010, the former faculties of the university were removed and replaced by a system of four larger Colleges, intended to encourage interdisciplinary research and make the university more competitive.[60] This structure was similar to that at other universities, including the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[61] | 26 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[62] | 13 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[63] | 12 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[64] | 101–150 |\n| *QS* (2025)[65] | 76= |\n| *THE* (2024)[66] | 87= |\n\n\n![](image)University of Glasgow's national league table performance over the past ten years\n![](image)Cloisters between quadrangles\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities[67] and was a founding member of the organisation, Universitas 21,[68] an international grouping of universities dedicated to setting worldwide standards for higher education. The university currently has fifteen Regius Professorships, more than in any other UK university.[69]\n\n\nIn the QS World University Rankings Glasgow climbed from 59th overall in 2011[70] to 54th in 2012,[71] then to 51st in 2013.[72]\nGlasgow places within the top 20 in the UK and 3rd in Scotland for the employability of its graduates as ranked by recruiters from the UK's major companies.[73]\n\n\nIn the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), almost 70% of research carried out at the university was in the top two categories (88% in the top three categories). Eighteen subject areas were rated top ten in the UK, whilst fourteen subject areas were rated the best in Scotland. The 2008 Times RAE table ranks according to an 'average' score across all departments, of which Glasgow posted an average of 2.6/4. The overall average placed Glasgow as the thirty-third-highest of all UK universities, perhaps reflecting the broadness of the university's activities. In terms of research 'power', however, Glasgow placed fourteenth in the UK and second in Scotland.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Admission and enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nUCAS Admission Statistics\n|  | 2022\n | 2021\n | 2020\n | 2019\n | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications**[α][76] | 41,915\n | 42,180\n | 36,455\n | 35,035\n | 35,135\n |\n| **Accepted**[α][76] | 6,220\n | 6,605\n | 6,495\n | 5,445\n | 5,440\n |\n| **Applications/Accepted Ratio**[α] | 6.7\n | 6.4\n | 5.6\n | 6.4\n | 6.5\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)**[β][77] | 61.0\n | 56.3\n | 60.5\n | 57.0\n | 55.3\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[78] | —\n | 209\n | 204\n | 199\n | 200\n |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Main scheme applications, International and UK\n2. **^** UK domiciled applicants\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[79] and Ethnicity[80] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 51%\n | 51 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International EU | 6%\n | 6 |\n| International Non-EU | 34%\n | 34 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[81][82] |\n| Female | 58%\n | 58 |\n| Private School | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 15%\n | 15 |\n\n\nAs of 2019/20, the university had 21,165 undergraduate and 11,300 postgraduate students.[83] Glasgow has a large (for the UK) proportion of \"home\" students, with almost 40 per cent of the student body coming from the West of Scotland.[84] In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 71:11:18 of UK:EU:non-EU students, respectively, with a female-to-male ratio of 59:41.[85]\n\n\nFor undergraduate entry, course requirements range from A\\*A\\*A\\* (for second year entry) to BBB (for minimum requirements for Primary Teaching) in A-levels.[86] Glasgow had the 23rd highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2015, with new students averaging 420 UCAS points,[87] equivalent to ABBbb in A-level grades.\n\n\nAs the number of places available for Scottish applicants are capped by the Scottish Government as they do not pay tuition fees, students applying from the rest of the UK and outside of the UK have a higher likelihood of an offer.[88] For most courses, with the exceptions of Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine and Law, the university guarantees unconditional offers to applicants who have achieved AAAA or AAABB in one sitting at Scottish Highers. The other components of the applicant's UCAS form (such as predicted grades and the personal statement) are only taken into account if the applicant has not achieved these grades.[89]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The quadrangle at the University of Glasgow\nThe University of Glasgow was the first university in Europe to divest from fossil fuel companies in October 2014. The 12-month campaign was led by the Glasgow University Climate Action Society and involved over 1,300 students.[90]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nUnlike other universities in Scotland, Glasgow does not have a single students' association; instead, there exist a number of bodies concerned with the representation, welfare, and entertainment of its students. Due to the university's retention of its separate male and female students' unions, which since 1980 have admitted both sexes as full members, there are two independent students' unions, as well as a sports association and the students' representative council. None of these are affiliated to the National Union of Students: membership has been rejected on a number of occasions, most recently in November 2006, on both economic and political grounds. A student-run \"No to NUS\" campaign won a campuswide referendum with more than 90% of the vote.[91]\n\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, students at Glasgow also elect a Rector.\n\n\nThe university has an eclectic body of clubs and societies, including sports teams, political and religious groups, and gaming societies.\n\n\n\n### Students' Representative Council[edit]\n\n\nGlasgow University Students' Representative Council is the legal representative body for students, as recognized by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The SRC is responsible for representing students' interests to the management of the university, to local and national government, and for health and welfare issues. Under the Universities (Scotland) Acts, all students of the university automatically become members of the SRC; however, they are entitled to opt-out of this. Members of the SRC sit on various committees throughout the university, from the departmental level to the Senate and Court.\n\n\nThe SRC organizes Media Week, RAG (Raising And Giving) Week, and Welfare Week, as well as funding some 130 clubs and societies.\n\n\n\n### Unions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Glasgow University Union and Queen Margaret Union\n\n![](image)The Glasgow University Union's building at No. 32 University Avenue\nIn addition to the Students' Representative Council, students are commonly members of one of the university's two students' unions, the Glasgow University Union (GUU) and the Queen Margaret Union (QMU).[92] Unlike many other student unions in the UK, membership to either GUU or QMU is not automatic and students must apply, for free, to become a member of either. Students are also permitted to be a member of both. These are largely social and cultural institutions, providing their members with facilities for debating, dining, recreation, socializing, and drinking, and both have a number of meeting rooms available for rental to members. Postgraduate students, mature students and staff were previously able to join the Hetherington Research Club;[93] however, large debts led to the club being closed in February 2010.[94][95] However, in February 2011, students gained access to the old HRC building, situated at 13 University Gardens (Hetherington House) and \"reopened\" it as the Free Hetherington, a social centre for learning and lectures, as well as protesting the shutting down of the club. Attempts to evict this occupation resulted in complaints of heavy-handed policing and much controversy on campus.[96][97]\n\n\nThe separate unions exist due to the university's previous male-only status; the GUU was founded before the admission of women, while the QMU was originally the union of Queen Margaret College, a women-only college which merged with the university in 1892. Their continued separate existence is due largely to their individual atmospheres. The GUU's focus is mainly towards people involved in sports and debates (as among its founders were the Athletic Association and Dialectic Society), the QMU is one of Glasgow's music venues, and has played host to Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Biffy Clyro and Franz Ferdinand.\n\n\nIn 1955, the GUU won the Observer Mace, now the John Smith Memorial Mace, named after the deceased GUU debater and former leader of the British Labour Party. The GUU has since won the mace debating championship fourteen more times, more than any other university. The GUU has also won the World Universities Debating Championships five times, more than any other university or club in the series' history.[98]\n\n\n\n### Sports association[edit]\n\n\nSporting affairs are regulated by the Glasgow University Sports Association (GUSA) (previously the Glasgow University Athletics Club) which works closely with the Sport and Recreation Service. There are a large number of varied clubs, including Squash, Gaelic Football, Basketball, Cycling, Football, Hockey, Netball, Martial Arts and Rowing, who regularly compete in BUCS competitions. Students who join one of the sports clubs affiliated with the university must also join GUSA. However, there are also regular classes and drop-in sessions for various sports which are non-competitive and available to all university gym members.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mature Students' Association[edit]\n\n\nThe community of mature students—that is those students aged 21 or over—are served by the Mature Students' Association located at 62 Oakfield Avenue. The MSA aims are to provide all mature students with facilities for recreation and study. Throughout the year, the MSA also organizes social events and peer support for the wide range of subjects studied by the university's mature students.[99]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere is an active student media scene at the university, part of, but editorially independent from, the SRC. There is a newspaper, the *Glasgow University Guardian*; *Glasgow University Magazine*; Glasgow University Student Television; and Subcity Radio. In recent years, independent of the SRC, the Queen Margaret Union has published a fortnightly magazine, *qmunicate*,[100] and Glasgow University Union has produced the *G-you* magazine, formerly known as GUUi.[101]\n\n\n\n### Mountaineering Club[edit]\n\n\n**Glasgow University Mountaineering Club** is an outdoor association whose membership is composed of students and staff. Its origins are known from the late 1930s when students were already meeting on the Arrochar Alps; however, the club was officially constituted at the university in March 1941.[102]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Glasgow people and List of Professorships at the University of Glasgow\n\nMany distinguished figures have taught, worked and studied at the University of Glasgow, including seven Nobel laureates and three Prime Ministers, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Bonar Law. Famous names include the physicist Lord Kelvin, his pupil, and later partner of the Carnegie Steel Corporation, George Lauder, 'father of economics' Adam Smith, engineer James Watt, inventors Henry Faulds and John Logie Baird, chemists William Ramsay, Frederick Soddy and Joseph Black, biologist Sir John Boyd Orr, philosophers Francis Hutcheson, Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, mathematician Colin Maclaurin, ethnologist James George Frazer, missionary David Livingstone, writers James Boswell, John Buchan, A. J. Cronin, Amy Hoff, Tobias Smollett and Edwin Morgan, and surgeon Joseph Lister. Famous orientalist and president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Henry Beveridge, University of Aberdeen founder Bishop William Elphinstone also graduated from Glasgow. In June 1933 Albert Einstein gave the first Gibson Lecture, on his general theory of relativity; he subsequently received an honorary degree from the university.[103] Also John Macintyre, pioneer of radiology and Jocelyn Bell Burnell who discovered radio pulsars.[104] In 1974, professors Graham Teasdale and Bryan Jennett developed the Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\n\nIn more recent times, the university was the focus of the \"Glasgow Group\" of poets and literary critics, including Philip Hobsbaum, Tom Leonard and Alasdair Gray.

Founded by papal bull in 1451 [O.S. 1450],[5] it is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities. Along with the universities of St Andrews, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century. Glasgow is the largest university in Scotland by total enrolment[3] and with over 19,500 postgraduates the second-largest in the United Kingdom by postgraduate enrolment.[3]\n\n\nIn common with universities of the pre-modern era, Glasgow originally educated students primarily from wealthy backgrounds; however, it became a pioneer[*citation needed*] in British higher education in the 19th century by also providing for the needs of students from the growing urban and commercial middle class. Glasgow University served all of these students by preparing them for professions: law, medicine, civil service, teaching, and the church. It also trained smaller but growing numbers for careers in science and engineering.[6] The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £923.6 million of which £196.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £998.5 million.[1] The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK. It is a member of Universitas 21, the Russell Group[7] and the Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities.\n\n\nThe university was originally located in the city's High Street; since 1870, its main campus has been at Gilmorehill in the City's West End.[8] Additionally, a number of university buildings are located elsewhere, such as the Veterinary School in Bearsden, and the Crichton Campus in Dumfries.[9]\n\n\nThe alumni of the University of Glasgow include some of the major figures of modern history, including James Wilson, a signatory of the United States Declaration of Independence, 3 Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom (William Lamb, Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Bonar Law), 3 Scottish First Ministers (Humza Yousaf, Nicola Sturgeon and Donald Dewar), economist Adam Smith, philosopher Francis Hutcheson, engineer James Watt, physicist Lord Kelvin, surgeon Joseph Lister along with 4 Nobel Prize laureates (In total 8 Nobel Prize winners are affiliated with the University) and numerous Olympic gold medallists, including the current chancellor, Dame Katherine Granger.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Glasgow was founded in 1451 by a charter or papal bull from Pope Nicholas V, at the suggestion of King James II, giving Bishop William Turnbull, a graduate of the University of St Andrews, permission to add a university to the city's Cathedral.[10] It is the second-oldest university in Scotland after St Andrews and the fourth-oldest in the English-speaking world. The universities of St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen were ecclesiastical foundations, while Edinburgh was a civic foundation. As one of the ancient universities of the United Kingdom, Glasgow is one of only eight institutions to award undergraduate master's degrees in certain disciplines.[11]\n\n\nThe university has been without its original Bull since the mid-sixteenth century. In 1560, during the political unrest accompanying the Scottish Reformation, the then chancellor, Archbishop James Beaton, a supporter of the Marian cause, fled to France. He took with him, for safe-keeping, many of the archives and valuables of the cathedral and the university, including the Mace and the Bull. Although the Mace was sent back in 1590, the archives were not. Principal James Fall told the Parliamentary Commissioners of Visitation on 28 August 1690, that he had seen the Bull at the Scots College in Paris, together with the many charters granted to the university by the monarchs of Scotland from James II to Mary, Queen of Scots. The university enquired of these documents in 1738 but was informed by Thomas Innes and the superiors of the Scots College that the original records of the foundation of the university were not to be found. If they had not been lost by this time, they certainly went astray during the French Revolution when the Scots College was under threat. Its records and valuables were moved for safe-keeping out of the city of Paris. The Bull remains the authority by which the university awards degrees.\n\n\nTeaching at the university began in the Chapter House of Glasgow Cathedral, subsequently moving to nearby Rottenrow, in a building known as the \"Auld Pedagogy\". The university was given 13 acres (5.3 ha) of land belonging to the Black Friars (Dominicans) on High Street by Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1563.[12] By the late 17th century its building centred on two courtyards surrounded by walled gardens, with a clock tower, which was one of the notable features of Glasgow's skyline—reaching 140 feet (43 m) in height[13]—and a chapel adapted from the church of the former Dominican (Blackfriars) friary. Remnants of this Scottish Renaissance building, mainly parts of the main façade, were transferred to the Gilmorehill campus and renamed as the \"Pearce Lodge\", after Sir William Pearce, the shipbuilding magnate who funded its preservation. The Lion and Unicorn Staircase was also transferred from the old college site and is now attached to the Main Building.\n\n\nJohn Anderson, while professor of natural philosophy at the university, and with some opposition from his colleagues, pioneered vocational education for working men and women during the Industrial Revolution. To continue this work in his will, he founded Anderson's College, which was associated with the university before merging with other institutions to become the University of Strathclyde in 1964.\n\n\nIn 1973, Delphine Parrott became its first female professor, as Gardiner Professor of Immunology.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2014, the university court voted for the university to become the first academic institution in Europe to divest from the fossil fuel industry.[15]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Glasgow, Older Building Sign\nThe university is currently spread over a few campuses. The main one is the Gilmorehill campus, in Hillhead. As well as this there is the Garscube Estate in Bearsden, housing the Veterinary School, Observatory, ship model basin and much of the university's sports facilities, the Dental School in the city center, the section of Mental Health and Well Being at Gartnavel Royal Hospital on Great Western Road, the Teaching and Learning Centre at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the Crichton Campus in Dumfries (operated jointly by the University of Glasgow, the University of the West of Scotland and the Open University).\n\n\nThe Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) was opened at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital on 29 March 2017, including a Clinical Innovation Zone spanning 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) of collaboration space for researchers and industry.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)A model of the old High Street Building, in the Hunterian Museum\n### High Street[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Glasgow in 1650\nThe university's initial accommodation including Glasgow University Library[17][18] was part of the complex of religious buildings in the precincts of Glasgow Cathedral. In 1460, the university received a grant of land from James, Lord Hamilton, on the east side of the High Street,[19] immediately north of the Blackfriars Church, on which it had its home for the next four hundred years. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Hamilton Building was replaced with a very grand two-court building with a decorated west front facing the High Street, called the 'Nova Erectio', or New Building. This foundation is widely considered to have been one of the finest 17th-century buildings in Scotland. Decorated fragments from it, including a complete exterior stairway, were rescued and built into its 19th-century replacement. In Sir Walter Scott's best-selling 1817 novel *Rob Roy*, set at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1715, the lead character fights a duel in the New Building grounds before the contest is broken up by Rob Roy MacGregor.\n\n\nOver the following centuries, the university's size and scope continued to expand. In 1757 it built the Macfarlane Observatory and later Scotland's first public museum, the Hunterian. It was a center of the Scottish Enlightenment and subsequently of the Industrial Revolution, and its expansion in the High Street was constrained. The area around the university declined as well-off residents moved westwards with the expansion of the city and overcrowding of the immediate area by less well-off residents. It was this rapid slumming of the area that was a chief catalyst of the university's migration westward.\n\n\n\n### Gilmorehill[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The new buildings of the University of Glasgow at Gilmorehill, circa 1895.\n![](image)The night view of the university's main building\nIn 1870, the university moved to a (then greenfield) site on Gilmorehill in the West End of the city, around three miles (5 km) west of its previous location, enclosed by a large meander of the River Kelvin. The original site on the High Street was sold to the City of Glasgow Union Railway and replaced by the college goods yard. The new-build campus was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic revival style. The largest of these buildings echoed, on a far grander scale, the original High Street campus's twin-quadrangle layout, and may have been inspired by Ypres' late-medieval cloth hall; Gilmorehill, in turn, inspired the design of the Clocktower complex of buildings for the new University of Otago in New Zealand. In 1879, Gilbert Scott's son, Oldrid, completed this original vision by building an open undercroft forming two quadrangles, above which is his grand Bute Hall (used for examinations and graduation ceremonies), named after its donor, John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Oldrid also later added a spire to the building's signature gothic bell tower in 1887, bringing it to a total height of some 85 metres (278 ft).[20] The local Bishopbriggs blond sandstone cladding and Gothic design of the building's exterior belie the modernity of its Victorian construction; Scott's building is structured upon what was then a cutting-edge riveted iron frame construction, supporting a lightweight wooden-beam roof. The building also forms the second-largest example of Gothic revival architecture in Britain, after the Palace of Westminster. An illustration of the Main Building previously featured on the reverse side of £100 notes issued by Clydesdale Bank.[21]\n\n\nThe university's Hunterian Museum resides in the Main Building, and the related Hunterian Gallery is housed in buildings adjacent to the University Library.[22] The latter includes \"The Mackintosh House\", a rebuilt terraced house designed by, and furnished after, architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh.\n\n\nEven these enlarged premises could not contain the expanding university, which quickly spread across much of Gilmorehill. The 1930s saw the construction of the award-winning round Reading Room (it is now a category-A listed building) and an aggressive program of house purchases, in which the university (fearing the surrounding district of Hillhead was running out of suitable building land) acquired several terraces of Victorian houses and joined them together internally. The departments of Psychology, Computing Science, and most of the Arts Faculty continue to be housed in these terraces.\n\n\n\n![](image)The School of History building occupies what were formerly townhouses on University Avenue.\nMore buildings were built to the west of the Main Building, developing the land between University Avenue and the River Kelvin with natural science buildings and the faculty of medicine. The medical school spread into neighboring Partick and joined with the Western Infirmary. At the eastern flank of the Main Building, the James Watt Engineering Building was completed in 1959. The growth and prosperity of the city, which had originally forced the university's relocation to Hillhead, again proved problematic when more real estate was required. The school of veterinary medicine, which was founded in 1862, moved to a new campus in the leafy surrounds of Garscube Estate, around two miles (3 km) west of the main campus, in 1954. The university later moved its sports ground and associated facilities to Garscube and also built student halls of residence in both Garscube and Maryhill.\n\n\nThe expected growth of tertiary education in the 1960s following publication of the Robbins Report led the university to build numerous modern buildings across Hillhead in a development zone, originally comprising mainly residential tenements, that had been designated on the north side of University Avenue in 1945.[23][24] Several of these new buildings were in the brutalist style; the Mathematics Building at the west end of University Avenue (opened 1968, demolished 2017),[23] the Rankine Building at the east end of University Avenue (opened 1970),[25] the multipurpose Adam Smith Building (opened 1967)[26] on the crest of the hill above University Gardens, and the new Queen Margaret Union building (opened 1968) on the University Gardens site previously occupied by the University Observatory.[27] These were joined by others in various modernist styles; both the Library and Boyd Orr Building (opened 1968 and 1972 respectively)[24][28] were configured as tower blocks, as was the Genetics Building at the very south end of the campus on Dumbarton Road (opened 1967, named for Guido Pontecorvo in 1994, demolished 2021),[29] while the amber-brick Geology Building (opened 1980, named for John Walter Gregory in 1998, renamed for Silas Molema in 2021) was built to a low-rise design on the former site of eight terraced houses in Lilybank Gardens.[30]\n\n\nTo further cater to the expanding student population, a new refectory – known as the Hub – was opened adjacent to the library in 1966, and the Glasgow University Union building at the eastern end of University Avenue was extended in 1965.\n\n\nIn October 2001 the century-old Bower Building (previously home to the university's botany department) was gutted by fire. The interior and roof of the building were largely destroyed, though the main façade remained intact. After a £10.8 million refit, the building re-opened in November 2004.\n\n\nThe Wolfson Medical School Building, with its award-winning glass-fronted atrium, opened in 2002,[31] and in 2003, the St Andrews Building was opened, housing the what is now the School of Education. It is sited a short walk from Gilmorehill, in the Woodlands area of the city on the site of the former Queens College, which had in turn been bought by Glasgow Caledonian University, from whom the university acquired the site. It replaced the St Andrews Campus in Bearsden. The university also procured the former Hillhead Congregational Church, converting it into a lecture theatre in 2005. The Sir Alwyn Williams building, designed by Reiach and Hall, was completed at Lilybank Terrace in 2007, housing the School of Computing Science.\n\n\nIn September 2016, in partnership with Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Life, and the National Library of Scotland, the transformed Kelvin Hall was brought into new public use including in Phase I the Hunterian Collections and Study Centre.[32]\n\n\nThe Mathematics Building, on University Way adjacent to the Boyd Orr Building, was demolished in 2017 to make way for a new 'Learning Hub' intended to provide individual and group study spaces for more than 2,500 students, as well as a 500-seat lecture theatre. Built at a cost of £90.6 million, it opened in April 2021 and is named for James McCune Smith, the first African American to earn a degree in medicine and a University of Glasgow alumnus.[33][34] A further investment of over £900 million is being made across the Gilmorehill campus, focused mainly on redeveloping the 5.7-hectare (14-acre) site between University Avenue and Dumbarton Road that was occupied by the Western Infirmary between 1874 and 2015.[34][35]\n\n\n\n#### Chapel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Glasgow Memorial Chapel\n\n![](image)Interior of the Chapel\nThe University Chapel was constructed as a memorial to the 755 sons of the university who had died in the First World War. Designed by Sir John Burnet, it was completed in 1929 and dedicated on 4 October. Tablets on the wall behind the Communion Table list the names of those who died, while other tablets besides the stalls record the 405 members of the university community who gave their lives in the Second World War. Most of the windows are the work of Douglas Strachan, although some have been added over the years, including those on the South Wall, created by Alan Younger.\n\n\nDaily services are held in the chapel during term-time, as well as seasonal events. Before Christmas, there is a Service of Nine Lessons and Carols on the last Sunday of term, and a Watchnight service on Christmas Eve. Graduates, students, members of staff, and the children of members of staff are entitled to be married in the chapel, which is also used for baptisms and funerals. Civil marriages and civil partnerships may be blessed in the chapel, although under UK law may not be performed there.[*verification needed*]\n\n\nThe current chaplain of the university is the Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie, and the university appoints honorary chaplains of other denominations.\n\n\n\n#### Library and archives[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Glasgow University Library\n\n![](image)The university's library hosts over three million volumes.[36]\nThe University Library, situated on Hillhead Street opposite the Main Building, is one of the oldest and largest libraries in Europe. Situated over 12 floors, it hosts more than three million books and journals, as well as providing access to an extensive range of electronic resources including over 51,900 electronic journals. It also houses sections for periodicals, microfilms, special collections and rare materials.[37] Open between 7 a.m. and 2 a.m., 361 days of the year, the library provides a resource not only for the academic community.\n\n\nIn addition to the main library, subject libraries also exist for Medicine, Chemistry, Dental Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Education, Law, History of Art, and the faculty of Social Sciences, which are held in branch libraries around the campus.[38] In 2007, a state-of-the-art section to house the library's collection of historic photographs was opened, funded by the Wolfson Foundation.[38]\n\n\nThe Archives of the University of Glasgow is the central place of deposit for the records of the university, created and accumulated since its foundation in 1451.\n\n\n\n### Crichton campus, Dumfries[edit]\n\n\nThe university opened the Crichton campus in Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway during the 1980s. It was designed to meet the needs for tertiary education in an area far from major cities and is operated jointly by the University of Glasgow, the University of the West of Scotland and the Open University. It offers a modular undergraduate curriculum, leading to one of a small number of liberal arts degrees, as well as providing the region's only access to postgraduate study.[39]\n\n\n\n### Non-teaching facilities[edit]\n\n\nAs well as these teaching campuses the university has halls of residence in and around the North-West of the city, accommodating a total of approximately 3,500 students.[40] These include the Murano Street halls in Maryhill; Wolfson halls on the Garscube Estate; Queen Margaret halls, in Kelvinside; Cairncross House and Kelvinhaugh Gate, in Yorkhill. In recent years, Dalrymple House and Horslethill halls in Dowanhill, Reith halls in North Kelvinside and the Maclay halls in Park Circus (near Kelvingrove Park), have closed and been sold, as the development value of such property increased.\n\n\nThe Stevenson Building on Gilmorehill opened in 1961 and provides students with the use of a fitness suite, squash courts, sauna, and six-lane, 25-metre swimming pool. The university also has a large sports complex on the Garscube Estate, besides their Wolfson Halls and Vet School. This is a new facility, replacing the previous *Westerlands* sports ground in the Anniesland area of the city. The university also has use of half of the East Boathouse situated at Glasgow Green on the River Clyde where Glasgow University Boat Club train.\n\n\n\n## Governance and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A block of buildings in Gilmorehill campus\nFurther information: Ancient university governance in Scotland\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland the university's constitution is laid out in the Universities (Scotland) Acts. These Acts create a tripartite structure of bodies: the University Court (governing body), the Academic Senate (academic affairs), and the General Council (advisory). There is also a clear separation between governance and executive administration.\n\n\nThe university's constitution, academic regulations, and appointments are described in the university calendar,[41] while other aspects of its story and constitution are detailed in a separate \"history\" document.[42]\n\n\n\n### Officers[edit]\n\n\nThere are several officers of the university. The role of each involves the management of the operations of Glasgow.\n\n\n\n#### Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chancellor of the University of Glasgow\n\nThe Chancellor is the titular head of the university and President of the General Council. They award all degrees, although this duty is generally carried out by the Vice-Chancellor, appointed by them.\n\n\nThe current Chancellor is Dame Katherine Grainger, a former rower who is Britain's most decorated female Olympian, the current chair of UK Sport, and former Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University. She is an alumna of the university, with a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Medical Law and Medical Ethics. She is the first woman to hold the office in the university.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rector of the University of Glasgow\n\nAll students at the university are eligible to vote in the election of the Rector (officially styled \"Lord Rector\"), who holds office for a three-year term and chairs the University Court. In the past, this position has been a largely honorary and ceremonial one, and has been held by political figures including William Gladstone, Benjamin Disraeli, Bonar Law, Robert Peel, Raymond Poincaré, Arthur Balfour, Charles Kennedy and 1970s union activist Jimmy Reid, and latterly by celebrities such as TV presenters Arthur Montford and Johnny Ball, musician Pat Kane, and actors Richard Wilson, Ross Kemp and Greg Hemphill. In 2004, for the first time in its history, the university was left without a Rector as no nominations were received. When the elections were run in December, Mordechai Vanunu was chosen for the post,[43] even though he was unable to attend due to restrictions placed upon him by the Israeli government. In 2014, Edward Snowden, an American computer specialist, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, and former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor—who came to international attention when he disclosed a large number of classified NSA documents to several media outlets—was elected.[44] In 2017, Aamer Anwar a Scottish lawyer and former student of the university was elected rector [45] until 2020 when rector elections had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 21, 2021, Rita Rae, Lady Rae a Scottish lawyer, judge and former Senator of the College of Justice was appointed Rector after a decisive victory.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Principal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Principal of the University of Glasgow\n\nDay-to-day management of the university is undertaken by the University Principal (who is also Vice-Chancellor). The current principal is Sir Anton Muscatelli who replaced Sir Muir Russell in October 2009.[48]\n\n\nThere are also several Vice-Principals, each with a specific remit. They, along with the Clerk of Senate, play a major role in the day-to-day management of the university.\n\n\n\n### University Court[edit]\n\n\nThe governing body of the university is the University Court, which is responsible for contractual matters, employing staff, and all other matters relating to finance and administration. The Court takes decisions about the deployment of resources as well as formulating strategic plans for the university. The Court is chaired by the Rector, who is elected by all the matriculated students at the university. The University Secretary is the Head of University Services and assists the Principal in day-to-day management. The current University Secretary is David Duncan.[49]\n\n\n\n### Academic Senate[edit]\n\n\nThe Academic Senate (or University Senate) is the body which is responsible for the management of academic affairs, and which recommends the conferment of degrees by the Chancellor. Membership of the Senate comprises all Professors of the university, as well as elected academic members, representatives of the Student's Representative Council, the Secretary of Court and directors of university services (e.g. Library). The President of the Senate is the principal.\n\n\nThe Clerk of Senate, who has a status equivalent to that of a Vice-Principal and is a member of the Senior Management Group, has responsibility for regulation of the university's academic policy, such as dealing with plagiarism and the conduct of examinations. Notable Clerks of Senate have included the chemist, Joseph Black; John Anderson, father of the University of Strathclyde; and the economist, John Millar.\n\n\n\n### Committees[edit]\n\n\nThere are also a number of committees of both the Court and Senate that make important decisions and investigate matters referred to them. As well as these bodies there is a General Council made up of the university graduates that is involved in the running of the university. The graduates also elect the Chancellor of the university.\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently four Colleges, each containing a number of Schools. They are:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **College of Arts & Humanities**\n* ArtsLab Glasgow\n* Graduate School of the College of Arts & Humanities\n* School of Critical Studies\n* School of Culture and Creative Arts\n* School of Humanities\n* School of Modern Languages and Cultures\n\n**College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences**\n* School of Biodiversity, One Health & Veterinary Medicine\n* School of Cancer Sciences\n* School of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Health\n* School of Health & Wellbeing\n* School of Infection & Immunity\n* School of Medicine, Dentistry & Nursing\n* School of Molecular Biosciences\n* School of Psychology & Neuroscience\n | **College of Science and Engineering**\n* School of Chemistry\n* School of Computing Science\n* James Watt School of Engineering\n* School of Geographical and Earth Sciences\n* School of Mathematics & Statistics\n* School of Physics and Astronomy\n\n**College of Social Sciences**\n* Adam Smith Business School\n* School of Education\n* School of Social & Environmental Sustainability (at Crichton Campus, Dumfries)\n* School of Law\n* School of Social & Political Sciences\n\n\n |\n\n![](image)Adam Smith lends his name to the business school\nAt the university's foundation in 1451, there were four original faculties: Arts, Divinity, Law, and Medicine. The Faculty of Divinity became a constituent school of the Faculty of Arts in 2002,[50] while the Faculty of Law was changed in 1984 into the Faculty of Law and Financial Studies, and in 2005 became the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences.[51] Although one of the original faculties established, teaching in the Faculty of Medicine did not begin formally until 1714, with the revival of the Chair in the Practice of Medicine.[52] The Faculty of Science was formed in 1893 from Chairs removed from the Faculties of Arts and Medicine, and subsequently divided in 2000 to form the three Faculties of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Computing Science, Mathematics and Statistics (now Information and Mathematical Sciences) and Physical Sciences.[53] The Faculty of Social Sciences was formed from Chairs in the Faculty of Arts in 1977, and merged to form the Faculty of Law, Business and Social Sciences in 2005, the two having operated as a single 'resource unit' since 2002.[54] The Faculty of Engineering was formally established in 1923, although engineering had been taught at the university since 1840 when Queen Victoria founded the UK's first Chair of Engineering. Through a concordat ratified in 1913,[55] Royal Technical College (later Royal College of Science and Technology and now University of Strathclyde) students received Glasgow degrees in applied sciences, particularly engineering. It was in 1769 when James Watt's engineering at Glasgow led to a stable steam engine and, subsequently, the Industrial Revolution. The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine was established in 1862 as the independent Glasgow Veterinary College, being subsumed into the university in 1949 and gaining independent Faculty status in 1969.[56] The Faculty of Education was formed when the university merged with St Andrew's College of Education in 1999.[57][58] St Andrew's College of Education was formed in 1981 through the merger of two Catholic colleges: Notre Dame College of Education, Glasgow, founded in 1895 and Craiglockhart College of Education, Edinburgh, founded in 1920.[59]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2010, the former faculties of the university were removed and replaced by a system of four larger Colleges, intended to encourage interdisciplinary research and make the university more competitive.[60] This structure was similar to that at other universities, including the University of Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[61] | 26 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[62] | 13 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[63] | 12 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[64] | 101–150 |\n| *QS* (2025)[65] | 76= |\n| *THE* (2024)[66] | 87= |\n\n\n![](image)University of Glasgow's national league table performance over the past ten years\n![](image)Cloisters between quadrangles\nThe university is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities[67] and was a founding member of the organisation, Universitas 21,[68] an international grouping of universities dedicated to setting worldwide standards for higher education. The university currently has fifteen Regius Professorships, more than in any other UK university.[69]\n\n\nIn the QS World University Rankings Glasgow climbed from 59th overall in 2011[70] to 54th in 2012,[71] then to 51st in 2013.[72]\nGlasgow places within the top 20 in the UK and 3rd in Scotland for the employability of its graduates as ranked by recruiters from the UK's major companies.[73]\n\n\nIn the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), almost 70% of research carried out at the university was in the top two categories (88% in the top three categories). Eighteen subject areas were rated top ten in the UK, whilst fourteen subject areas were rated the best in Scotland. The 2008 Times RAE table ranks according to an 'average' score across all departments, of which Glasgow posted an average of 2.6/4. The overall average placed Glasgow as the thirty-third-highest of all UK universities, perhaps reflecting the broadness of the university's activities. In terms of research 'power', however, Glasgow placed fourteenth in the UK and second in Scotland.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Admission and enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nUCAS Admission Statistics\n|  | 2022\n | 2021\n | 2020\n | 2019\n | 2018\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications**[α][76] | 41,915\n | 42,180\n | 36,455\n | 35,035\n | 35,135\n |\n| **Accepted**[α][76] | 6,220\n | 6,605\n | 6,495\n | 5,445\n | 5,440\n |\n| **Applications/Accepted Ratio**[α] | 6.7\n | 6.4\n | 5.6\n | 6.4\n | 6.5\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)**[β][77] | 61.0\n | 56.3\n | 60.5\n | 57.0\n | 55.3\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[78] | —\n | 209\n | 204\n | 199\n | 200\n |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Main scheme applications, International and UK\n2. **^** UK domiciled applicants\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[79] and Ethnicity[80] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 51%\n | 51 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International EU | 6%\n | 6 |\n| International Non-EU | 34%\n | 34 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[81][82] |\n| Female | 58%\n | 58 |\n| Private School | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 15%\n | 15 |\n\n\nAs of 2019/20, the university had 21,165 undergraduate and 11,300 postgraduate students.[83] Glasgow has a large (for the UK) proportion of \"home\" students, with almost 40 per cent of the student body coming from the West of Scotland.[84] In the 2016–17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 71:11:18 of UK:EU:non-EU students, respectively, with a female-to-male ratio of 59:41.[85]\n\n\nFor undergraduate entry, course requirements range from A\\*A\\*A\\* (for second year entry) to BBB (for minimum requirements for Primary Teaching) in A-levels.[86] Glasgow had the 23rd highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2015, with new students averaging 420 UCAS points,[87] equivalent to ABBbb in A-level grades.\n\n\nAs the number of places available for Scottish applicants are capped by the Scottish Government as they do not pay tuition fees, students applying from the rest of the UK and outside of the UK have a higher likelihood of an offer.[88] For most courses, with the exceptions of Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine and Law, the university guarantees unconditional offers to applicants who have achieved AAAA or AAABB in one sitting at Scottish Highers. The other components of the applicant's UCAS form (such as predicted grades and the personal statement) are only taken into account if the applicant has not achieved these grades.[89]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The quadrangle at the University of Glasgow\nThe University of Glasgow was the first university in Europe to divest from fossil fuel companies in October 2014. The 12-month campaign was led by the Glasgow University Climate Action Society and involved over 1,300 students.[90]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nUnlike other universities in Scotland, Glasgow does not have a single students' association; instead, there exist a number of bodies concerned with the representation, welfare, and entertainment of its students. Due to the university's retention of its separate male and female students' unions, which since 1980 have admitted both sexes as full members, there are two independent students' unions, as well as a sports association and the students' representative council. None of these are affiliated to the National Union of Students: membership has been rejected on a number of occasions, most recently in November 2006, on both economic and political grounds. A student-run \"No to NUS\" campaign won a campuswide referendum with more than 90% of the vote.[91]\n\n\nIn common with the other ancient universities of Scotland, students at Glasgow also elect a Rector.\n\n\nThe university has an eclectic body of clubs and societies, including sports teams, political and religious groups, and gaming societies.\n\n\n\n### Students' Representative Council[edit]\n\n\nGlasgow University Students' Representative Council is the legal representative body for students, as recognized by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The SRC is responsible for representing students' interests to the management of the university, to local and national government, and for health and welfare issues. Under the Universities (Scotland) Acts, all students of the university automatically become members of the SRC; however, they are entitled to opt-out of this. Members of the SRC sit on various committees throughout the university, from the departmental level to the Senate and Court.\n\n\nThe SRC organizes Media Week, RAG (Raising And Giving) Week, and Welfare Week, as well as funding some 130 clubs and societies.\n\n\n\n### Unions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Glasgow University Union and Queen Margaret Union\n\n![](image)The Glasgow University Union's building at No. 32 University Avenue\nIn addition to the Students' Representative Council, students are commonly members of one of the university's two students' unions, the Glasgow University Union (GUU) and the Queen Margaret Union (QMU).[92] Unlike many other student unions in the UK, membership to either GUU or QMU is not automatic and students must apply, for free, to become a member of either. Students are also permitted to be a member of both. These are largely social and cultural institutions, providing their members with facilities for debating, dining, recreation, socializing, and drinking, and both have a number of meeting rooms available for rental to members. Postgraduate students, mature students and staff were previously able to join the Hetherington Research Club;[93] however, large debts led to the club being closed in February 2010.[94][95] However, in February 2011, students gained access to the old HRC building, situated at 13 University Gardens (Hetherington House) and \"reopened\" it as the Free Hetherington, a social centre for learning and lectures, as well as protesting the shutting down of the club. Attempts to evict this occupation resulted in complaints of heavy-handed policing and much controversy on campus.[96][97]\n\n\nThe separate unions exist due to the university's previous male-only status; the GUU was founded before the admission of women, while the QMU was originally the union of Queen Margaret College, a women-only college which merged with the university in 1892. Their continued separate existence is due largely to their individual atmospheres. The GUU's focus is mainly towards people involved in sports and debates (as among its founders were the Athletic Association and Dialectic Society), the QMU is one of Glasgow's music venues, and has played host to Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Biffy Clyro and Franz Ferdinand.\n\n\nIn 1955, the GUU won the Observer Mace, now the John Smith Memorial Mace, named after the deceased GUU debater and former leader of the British Labour Party. The GUU has since won the mace debating championship fourteen more times, more than any other university. The GUU has also won the World Universities Debating Championships five times, more than any other university or club in the series' history.[98]\n\n\n\n### Sports association[edit]\n\n\nSporting affairs are regulated by the Glasgow University Sports Association (GUSA) (previously the Glasgow University Athletics Club) which works closely with the Sport and Recreation Service. There are a large number of varied clubs, including Squash, Gaelic Football, Basketball, Cycling, Football, Hockey, Netball, Martial Arts and Rowing, who regularly compete in BUCS competitions. Students who join one of the sports clubs affiliated with the university must also join GUSA. However, there are also regular classes and drop-in sessions for various sports which are non-competitive and available to all university gym members.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Mature Students' Association[edit]\n\n\nThe community of mature students—that is those students aged 21 or over—are served by the Mature Students' Association located at 62 Oakfield Avenue. The MSA aims are to provide all mature students with facilities for recreation and study. Throughout the year, the MSA also organizes social events and peer support for the wide range of subjects studied by the university's mature students.[99]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere is an active student media scene at the university, part of, but editorially independent from, the SRC. There is a newspaper, the *Glasgow University Guardian*; *Glasgow University Magazine*; Glasgow University Student Television; and Subcity Radio. In recent years, independent of the SRC, the Queen Margaret Union has published a fortnightly magazine, *qmunicate*,[100] and Glasgow University Union has produced the *G-you* magazine, formerly known as GUUi.[101]\n\n\n\n### Mountaineering Club[edit]\n\n\n**Glasgow University Mountaineering Club** is an outdoor association whose membership is composed of students and staff. Its origins are known from the late 1930s when students were already meeting on the Arrochar Alps; however, the club was officially constituted at the university in March 1941.[102]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Glasgow people and List of Professorships at the University of Glasgow\n\nMany distinguished figures have taught, worked and studied at the University of Glasgow, including seven Nobel laureates and three Prime Ministers, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and Bonar Law. Famous names include the physicist Lord Kelvin, his pupil, and later partner of the Carnegie Steel Corporation, George Lauder, 'father of economics' Adam Smith, engineer James Watt, inventors Henry Faulds and John Logie Baird, chemists William Ramsay, Frederick Soddy and Joseph Black, biologist Sir John Boyd Orr, philosophers Francis Hutcheson, Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, mathematician Colin Maclaurin, ethnologist James George Frazer, missionary David Livingstone, writers James Boswell, John Buchan, A. J. Cronin, Amy Hoff, Tobias Smollett and Edwin Morgan, and surgeon Joseph Lister. Famous orientalist and president of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Henry Beveridge, University of Aberdeen founder Bishop William Elphinstone also graduated from Glasgow. In June 1933 Albert Einstein gave the first Gibson Lecture, on his general theory of relativity; he subsequently received an honorary degree from the university.[103] Also John Macintyre, pioneer of radiology and Jocelyn Bell Burnell who discovered radio pulsars.[104] In 1974, professors Graham Teasdale and Bryan Jennett developed the Glasgow Coma Scale.\n\n\nIn more recent times, the university was the focus of the \"Glasgow Group\" of poets and literary critics, including Philip Hobsbaum, Tom Leonard and Alasdair Gray. The university boasts one of Europe's largest collections of life scientists,[*citation needed*] as well as having been the training ground of numerous politicians including former Prime Ministers Bonar Law and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, former First Minister Donald Dewar, former leader of the Liberal Democrats and former Rector Charles Kennedy, Defence Secretaries Liam Fox and Des Browne, the founder of the UK Independence Party Alan Sked, former Labour Party leader John Smith, Business Secretary Vince Cable, former leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Menzies Campbell, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, and current First Minister Humza Yousaf. Other notable alumni include banker Fred Goodwin, actor Gerard Butler, Rangers and Scottish footballer Neil Murray, actor, writer, television and radio broadcaster Colin Lamont (aka Scottie McClue), novelist Robin Jenkins, founder of the world's largest non-governmental development organisation BRAC Fazle Hasan Abed, television writers Armando Iannucci and Steven Moffat, comedian Greg Hemphill, television presenter Neil Oliver, journalists Andrew Neil and Raman Bhardwaj, and musicians Emeli Sandé and Simon Neil.\n\n\n\n* ![Lord Lister](image)\n\nLord Lister\n* ![Francis Hutcheson](image)\n\nFrancis Hutcheson\n* ![Thomas Reid](image)\n\nThomas Reid\n* ![Lord Kelvin](image)\n\nLord Kelvin\n* ![Joseph Black](image)\n\nJoseph Black\n* ![William Elphinstone](image)\n\nWilliam Elphinstone\n* ![James Watt](image)\n\nJames Watt\n* ![Sir Menzies Campbell](image)\n\nSir Menzies Campbell\n* ![Nicola Sturgeon](image)\n\nNicola Sturgeon\n* ![Andrew Neil](image)\n\nAndrew Neil\n\n\n### World Changing Alumni Award[edit]\n\n\nWith the World-Changing Alumni Award, formerly the Young Alumnus of the Year Award, the university is recognizing and celebrating the achievements of alumni who have graduated within the last 15 years and made a major contribution to the community, arts, sciences, or business.\n\n\nThe award was established in 2001 as part of the university's 550th-anniversary celebrations and is given out once per year. The trophy was donated by the Old Boys of Allan Glen's School, is presented to the winning candidate at one of the year's graduation ceremonies or flagship events.[105]\n\n\nWinners:\n\n\n\n* 2021: Fiona McPhail (LLB 2007)[106]\n* 2020: Selina Hales (MA 2005)[107]\n* 2019: Eunice Ntobedzi (MSc 2016)[108]\n* 2018: Amal Azzudin (BA 2011, MSc 2014)[109]\n* 2017: Susanne Mitschke (MSc 2015); Patrick Renner (MSc 2015)[110]\n* 2016: Matt Fountain (MA Hons 2011)\n* 2015: Mhairi Black MP (MA 2015)[111]\n* 2014: Martin Patience (MA 2002)\n* 2013: Karina Atkinson (BSc 2007)\n* 2012: Katherine Grainger MBE CBE (MPhil 2001)\n* 2011: Emeli Sandé (BSc 2009)\n* 2010: Patrick Gunning (BSc 2001, PhD 2005)\n* 2009: Euan Murray (BVMS 2003)\n* 2008: Mark Beaumont (MA 2006); John Tiffany (MA 1994)\n* 2007: Vanessa Munro (LLB 1997, PhD 2001)\n* 2006: Richard Dixon (BVMS 1993, PhD 2000)\n* 2005: Christopher Brookmyre (MA 1989)\n* 2004: Colin McInnes (BSc 1988, PhD 1991)\n* 2003: Emma Richards (BSc 1996)\n* 2001: Mark Johnston (BVMS 1983); Lorraine Clinton (MA 1986)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Academic dress of the University of Glasgow\n* Armorial of UK universities\n* Banknotes of Scotland (Gilmorehill featured on design)\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of universities in the United Kingdom\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Includes those who indicate that they identify as Asian, Black, Mixed Heritage, Arab or any other ethnicity except White.\n2. **^** Calculated from the Polar4 measure, using Quintile1, in England and Wales.

Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – notably in theology and philosophy – it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: *Faculté des Lettres*), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\n\nIn 1970, following the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\nThe university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest, as students had to graduate there in order to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students were divided into four *nationes* according to language or regional origin: France, Normandy, Picardy, and England. The last came to be known as the *Alemannian* (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English-German nation included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Sorbonne\nThree schools were especially famous in Paris: the *palatine or palace school*, the *school of Notre-Dame*, and that of Sainte-Geneviève Abbey. The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Geneviève was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Liège, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Geneviève, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów, Bishop of Kraków; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of Cîteaux; Robert d'Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. Three other men who added prestige to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève were William of Champeaux, Abélard, and Peter Lombard.\n\n\nHumanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Patristic Fathers. It was completed by the study of Canon law. The School of Saint-Victor arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of Saint-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor.\n\n\nThe plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the *Decretum Gratiani* brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orléans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, *physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit*.\n\n\nProfessors were required to have measurable knowledge and be appointed by the university. Applicants had to be assessed by examination; if successful, the examiner, who was the head of the school, and known as *scholasticus*, *capiscol*, and *chancellor,* appointed an individual to teach. This was called the licence or faculty to teach. The licence had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, the examiner could not refuse to award it when the applicant deserved it.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe school of Saint-Victor, under the abbey, conferred the licence in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Geneviève on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the \"Island\" and on the \"Mount\". \"Whoever\", says Crevier \"had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\" Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \"near the Petit Pont\"; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \"taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\" (*Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris,* I, 272).\n\n\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). Poets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne covered by snow.\nTo allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.[6]\n\n\nAs the university developed, it became more institutionalized. First, the professors formed an association, for according to Matthew Paris, John of Celles, twenty-first Abbot of St Albans, England, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of Paris after he had followed the courses (*Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban*). The masters, as well as the students, were divided according to national origin,. Alban wrote that Henry II, King of England, in his difficulties with St. Thomas of Canterbury, wanted to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of Paris, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was likely the start of the division according to \"nations,\" which was later to play an important part in the university. Celestine III ruled that both professors and students had the privilege of being subject only to the ecclesiastical courts, not to civil courts.\n\n\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. The chancellor of Ste-Geneviève continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n\n\n### 13th–14th century: Expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\n\nIn 1215, the Apostolic legate, Robert de Courçon, issued new rules governing who could become a professor. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology, the candidate had to be thirty years of age, with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local schools under the direction of a master. In Paris, one was regarded as a scholar only by studies with particular masters. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by oath, in defence of their rights, when they could not otherwise obtain justice in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these sciences were less prominent.\n\n\n\nMain article: University of Paris strike of 1229\n\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Châlons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Courçon's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.\n\n\n\n#### Four \"nations\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nMain article: Nation (university)\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\n\n\n* French nation: all the Romance-speaking parts of Europe except those included within the Norman and Picard nations\n* English nation (renamed 'German nation' after the Hundred Years' War): the British Isles, the Germanic-speaking parts of continental Europe (except those included within the Picard nation), and the Slavic-speaking parts of Europe. The majority of students within that nation came from Germany and Scotland, and when it was renamed 'German nation' it was also sometimes called *natio Germanorum et Scotorum* (\"nation of the Germans and Scots\").[7][8]\n* Norman nation: the ecclesiastical province of Rouen, which corresponded approximately to the Duchy of Normandy. This was a Romance-speaking territory, but it was not included within the French nation.\n* Picard nation: the Romance-speaking bishoprics of Beauvais, Noyon, Amiens, Laon, and Arras; the bilingual (Romance and Germanic-speaking) bishoprics of Thérouanne, Cambrai, and Tournai; a large part of the bilingual bishopric of Liège; and the southernmost part of the Germanic-speaking bishopric of Utrecht (the part of that bishopric located south of the river Meuse; the rest of the bishopric north of the Meuse belonged to the English nation). It was estimated that about half of the students in the Picard nation were Romance-speakers (Picard and Walloon), and the other half were Germanic-speakers (West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish dialects).[9]\n\n\n#### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Faculty of Law of Paris\n\nTo classify professors' knowledge, the schools of Paris gradually divided into faculties. Professors of the same science were brought into closer contact until the community of rights and interests cemented the union and made them distinct groups. The faculty of medicine seems to have been the last to form. But the four faculties were already formally established by 1254, when the university described in a letter \"theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy\". The masters of theology often set the example for the other faculties—e.g., they were the first to adopt an official seal.\n\n\nThe faculties of theology, canon law, and medicine, were called \"superior faculties\". The title of \"Dean\" as designating the head of a faculty, came into use by 1268 in the faculties of law and medicine, and by 1296 in the faculty of theology. It seems that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The faculty of arts continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the rector. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for theology, law and medicine, though it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties included only doctors, leaving the bachelors to the faculty of arts. At this period, therefore, the university had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate and the DEA became intermediate degrees.\n\n\n\n#### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Courçon had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d'Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\nBesides the famous Collège de Sorbonne, other *collegia* provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were 8 or 9 *collegia* for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the *Collegium danicum* or *dacicum*, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the 13th and 14th centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the *Collegium Upsaliense*, the *Collegium Scarense* or the *Collegium Lincopense*, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara and Linköping.\n\n\nThe *Collège de Navarre* was founded in 1305, originally aimed at students from Navarre, but due to its size, wealth, and the links between the crowns of France and Navarre, it quickly accepted students from other nations. The establishment of the College of Navarre was a turning point in the university's history: Navarra was the first college to offer teaching to its students, which at the time set it apart from all previous colleges, founded as charitable institutions that provided lodging, but no tuition. Navarre's model combining lodging and tuition would be reproduced by other colleges, both in Paris and other universities.\n[10]\n\n\nThe German College, *Collegium alemanicum* is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or *Collegium scoticum* was founded in 1325. The Lombard college or *Collegium lombardicum* was founded in the 1330s. The *Collegium constantinopolitanum* was, according to a tradition, founded in the 13th century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the *Collège de la Marche-Winville*. The Collège de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the 14th century, and reformed in the 15th century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).\n\n\nAt this time, the university also went the controversy of the condemnations of 1210–1277.\n\n\nThe Irish College in Paris originated in 1578 with students dispersed between Collège Montaigu, Collège de Boncourt, and the Collège de Navarre, in 1677 it was awarded possession of the Collège des Lombards. A new Irish College was built in 1769 in rue du Cheval Vert (now rue des Irlandais), which exists today as the Irish Chaplaincy and Cultural centre.\n\n\n\n### 15th–18th century: Influence in France and Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n![](image)The Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d'Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, *Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle*, 132–34; *Archiv. du ministère de l'instruction publique*).\n\n\n\n### 1793: Abolition by the French Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne as seen from *rue des Écoles*.\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien régime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools, \n\n\n> \"there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men\".\n> \n> \n\n\nMeasures were to be taken immediately: \"For means of execution the department and the municipality of Paris are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic\". This was the death-sentence of the university. It was not to be restored after the Revolution had subsided, no more than those of the provinces.\n\n\n\n### 1806–1968: Re-establishment[edit]\n\n\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. At this time, the building of the Sorbonne was fully renovated.[11]\n\n\n\n### May 1968–1970: Shutdown[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: May 68\n\nThe student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government's failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own, and lacked academic traditions, amenities to support student life, or resident professors. One-third of all French university students ended up in these new faculties, and were ripe for radicalization as a result of being forced to pursue their studies in such shabby conditions.[12]\n\n\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[13] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[14] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[15] After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[16] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[17] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, gathering students and workers on strike.[18] The number of workers on strike reached about nine million by 22 May.[14] As explained by Bill Readings:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> [President Charles de Gaulle] responded on May 24 by calling for a referendum, and [...] the revolutionaries, led by informal action committees, attacked and burned the Paris Stock Exchange in response. The Gaullist government then held talks with union leaders, who agreed to a package of wage-rises and increases in union rights. The strikers, however, simply refused the plan. With the French state tottering, de Gaulle fled France on May 29 for a French military base in Germany. He later returned and, with the assurance of military support, announced [general] elections [within] forty days. [...] Over the next two months, the strikes were broken (or broke up) while the election was won by the Gaullists with an increased majority.[19]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### 1970: Division[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of universities and higher education institutions in the Paris region § History since the dissolution of the University of Paris (1970)\n\nFollowing the disruption, de Gaulle appointed Edgar Faure as minister of education; Faure was assigned to prepare a legislative proposal for reform of the French university system, with the help of academics.[20] Their proposal was adopted on 12 November 1968;[21] in accordance with the new law, the faculties of the University of Paris were to reorganize themselves.[22] This led to the division of the University of Paris into 13 universities.\n\n\nIn 2017, Paris 4 and Paris 6 universities merged to form the Sorbonne University.[23] In 2019, Paris 5 and Paris 7 universities merged to form the new Paris Cité University, leaving the number of successor universities at 11.[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Number\n | Previous name\n | Current name\n | Faculties/institutes before breakup\n | Current subjects\n | Students\n | Academy\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Paris I\n | University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne | Faculty of Law and Economics (35 out of 41 of the economics Professors joined, along with a few professors from law) and the Faculty of Humanities.

Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Notre Dame de Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe.[1]\n\n\nOfficially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was later often nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.[1]\n\n\nHighly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – notably in theology and philosophy – it introduced several academic standards and traditions that have endured ever since and spread internationally, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d'Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).[2]\n\n\nIn 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold.[3] A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (French: *Faculté des Lettres*), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).\n\n\nIn 1970, following the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nIn 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the Notre-Dame cathedral school. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris' reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St. Albans) and his acceptance into \"the fellowship of the elect Masters\" there in about 1170,[4] and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21.\n\n\nThe corporation was formally recognised as an \"*Universitas*\" in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.[5]\n\n\nThe university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest, as students had to graduate there in order to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students were divided into four *nationes* according to language or regional origin: France, Normandy, Picardy, and England. The last came to be known as the *Alemannian* (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English-German nation included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nThe faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king's laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.\n\n\n\n### 12th century: Organisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Sorbonne\nThree schools were especially famous in Paris: the *palatine or palace school*, the *school of Notre-Dame*, and that of Sainte-Geneviève Abbey. The decline of royalty brought about the decline of the first. The other two were ancient but did not have much visibility in the early centuries. The glory of the palatine school doubtless eclipsed theirs, until it completely gave way to them. These two centres were much frequented and many of their masters were esteemed for their learning. The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Geneviève was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Liège, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Geneviève, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów, Bishop of Kraków; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of Cîteaux; Robert d'Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. Three other men who added prestige to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève were William of Champeaux, Abélard, and Peter Lombard.\n\n\nHumanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Patristic Fathers. It was completed by the study of Canon law. The School of Saint-Victor arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of Saint-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor.\n\n\nThe plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the *Decretum Gratiani* brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orléans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d'Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, *physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit*.\n\n\nProfessors were required to have measurable knowledge and be appointed by the university. Applicants had to be assessed by examination; if successful, the examiner, who was the head of the school, and known as *scholasticus*, *capiscol*, and *chancellor,* appointed an individual to teach. This was called the licence or faculty to teach. The licence had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, the examiner could not refuse to award it when the applicant deserved it.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe school of Saint-Victor, under the abbey, conferred the licence in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Geneviève on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the \"Island\" and on the \"Mount\". \"Whoever\", says Crevier \"had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.\" Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his \"near the Petit Pont\"; another Adam, Parisian by birth, \"taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change\" (*Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris,* I, 272).\n\n\nThe number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: \"At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.\" (\"Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste\"). Poets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne covered by snow.\nTo allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.[6]\n\n\nAs the university developed, it became more institutionalized. First, the professors formed an association, for according to Matthew Paris, John of Celles, twenty-first Abbot of St Albans, England, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of Paris after he had followed the courses (*Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban*). The masters, as well as the students, were divided according to national origin,. Alban wrote that Henry II, King of England, in his difficulties with St. Thomas of Canterbury, wanted to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of Paris, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was likely the start of the division according to \"nations,\" which was later to play an important part in the university. Celestine III ruled that both professors and students had the privilege of being subject only to the ecclesiastical courts, not to civil courts.\n\n\nThe three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the *Universitas scholarium*, which included masters and students; hence the name *University*. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. The chancellor of Ste-Geneviève continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.\n\n\n\n### 13th–14th century: Expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of doctors at the University of Paris. From a 16th-century miniature.\nIn 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma \"for the security of the scholars of Paris,\" which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king's officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.\n\n\nIn 1215, the Apostolic legate, Robert de Courçon, issued new rules governing who could become a professor. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology, the candidate had to be thirty years of age, with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local schools under the direction of a master. In Paris, one was regarded as a scholar only by studies with particular masters. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by oath, in defence of their rights, when they could not otherwise obtain justice in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these sciences were less prominent.\n\n\n\nMain article: University of Paris strike of 1229\n\nIn 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: \"Paris\", said Gregory IX, \"mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters\". He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Châlons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Courçon's statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.\n\n\nThe pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.\n\n\n\n#### Rector[edit]\n\n\nThe university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.\n\n\n\n#### Four \"nations\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing the territories covered by the four nations of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.\nMain article: Nation (university)\n\nThe \"nations\" appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years' War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.\n\n\nThe territories covered by the four nations were:\n\n\n\n* French nation: all the Romance-speaking parts of Europe except those included within the Norman and Picard nations\n* English nation (renamed 'German nation' after the Hundred Years' War): the British Isles, the Germanic-speaking parts of continental Europe (except those included within the Picard nation), and the Slavic-speaking parts of Europe. The majority of students within that nation came from Germany and Scotland, and when it was renamed 'German nation' it was also sometimes called *natio Germanorum et Scotorum* (\"nation of the Germans and Scots\").[7][8]\n* Norman nation: the ecclesiastical province of Rouen, which corresponded approximately to the Duchy of Normandy. This was a Romance-speaking territory, but it was not included within the French nation.\n* Picard nation: the Romance-speaking bishoprics of Beauvais, Noyon, Amiens, Laon, and Arras; the bilingual (Romance and Germanic-speaking) bishoprics of Thérouanne, Cambrai, and Tournai; a large part of the bilingual bishopric of Liège; and the southernmost part of the Germanic-speaking bishopric of Utrecht (the part of that bishopric located south of the river Meuse; the rest of the bishopric north of the Meuse belonged to the English nation). It was estimated that about half of the students in the Picard nation were Romance-speakers (Picard and Walloon), and the other half were Germanic-speakers (West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish dialects).[9]\n\n\n#### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Faculty of Law of Paris\n\nTo classify professors' knowledge, the schools of Paris gradually divided into faculties. Professors of the same science were brought into closer contact until the community of rights and interests cemented the union and made them distinct groups. The faculty of medicine seems to have been the last to form. But the four faculties were already formally established by 1254, when the university described in a letter \"theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy\". The masters of theology often set the example for the other faculties—e.g., they were the first to adopt an official seal.\n\n\nThe faculties of theology, canon law, and medicine, were called \"superior faculties\". The title of \"Dean\" as designating the head of a faculty, came into use by 1268 in the faculties of law and medicine, and by 1296 in the faculty of theology. It seems that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The faculty of arts continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the rector. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for theology, law and medicine, though it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties included only doctors, leaving the bachelors to the faculty of arts. At this period, therefore, the university had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate and the DEA became intermediate degrees.\n\n\n\n#### Colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rue Saint-Jacques and the Sorbonne in Paris\nThe scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Courçon had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.\n\n\nFour colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d'Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.\n\n\nBesides the famous Collège de Sorbonne, other *collegia* provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were 8 or 9 *collegia* for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the *Collegium danicum* or *dacicum*, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the 13th and 14th centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the *Collegium Upsaliense*, the *Collegium Scarense* or the *Collegium Lincopense*, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara and Linköping.\n\n\nThe *Collège de Navarre* was founded in 1305, originally aimed at students from Navarre, but due to its size, wealth, and the links between the crowns of France and Navarre, it quickly accepted students from other nations. The establishment of the College of Navarre was a turning point in the university's history: Navarra was the first college to offer teaching to its students, which at the time set it apart from all previous colleges, founded as charitable institutions that provided lodging, but no tuition. Navarre's model combining lodging and tuition would be reproduced by other colleges, both in Paris and other universities.\n[10]\n\n\nThe German College, *Collegium alemanicum* is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or *Collegium scoticum* was founded in 1325. The Lombard college or *Collegium lombardicum* was founded in the 1330s. The *Collegium constantinopolitanum* was, according to a tradition, founded in the 13th century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the *Collège de la Marche-Winville*. The Collège de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the 14th century, and reformed in the 15th century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).\n\n\nAt this time, the university also went the controversy of the condemnations of 1210–1277.\n\n\nThe Irish College in Paris originated in 1578 with students dispersed between Collège Montaigu, Collège de Boncourt, and the Collège de Navarre, in 1677 it was awarded possession of the Collège des Lombards. A new Irish College was built in 1769 in rue du Cheval Vert (now rue des Irlandais), which exists today as the Irish Chaplaincy and Cultural centre.\n\n\n\n### 15th–18th century: Influence in France and Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Sorbonne on fire in 1670.\n![](image)The Sorbonne, Paris, in a 17th-century engraving\nIn the fifteenth century, Guillaume d'Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The \"faculty of law\" hence replaced the \"faculty of decretals\". The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years' War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.\n\n\nBesides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.\n\n\nProud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.\n\n\nIts patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under Louis XIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king's disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, *Hist. de l'Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle*, 132–34; *Archiv. du ministère de l'instruction publique*).\n\n\n\n### 1793: Abolition by the French Revolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Sorbonne as seen from *rue des Écoles*.\nThe ancient university disappeared with the ancien régime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools, \n\n\n> \"there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men\".\n> \n> \n\n\nMeasures were to be taken immediately: \"For means of execution the department and the municipality of Paris are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic\". This was the death-sentence of the university. It was not to be restored after the Revolution had subsided, no more than those of the provinces.\n\n\n\n### 1806–1968: Re-establishment[edit]\n\n\nThe university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of \"Arts\". After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the \"licence\" (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. At this time, the building of the Sorbonne was fully renovated.[11]\n\n\n\n### May 1968–1970: Shutdown[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: May 68\n\nThe student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government's failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own, and lacked academic traditions, amenities to support student life, or resident professors. One-third of all French university students ended up in these new faculties, and were ripe for radicalization as a result of being forced to pursue their studies in such shabby conditions.[12]\n\n\nIn 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed \"the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria\" as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls.[13] Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre;[14] indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen \"as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university\".[15] After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968.[16] Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week.[17] Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, gathering students and workers on strike.[18] The number of workers on strike reached about nine million by 22 May.[14] As explained by Bill Readings:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> [President Charles de Gaulle] responded on May 24 by calling for a referendum, and [...] the revolutionaries, led by informal action committees, attacked and burned the Paris Stock Exchange in response. The Gaullist government then held talks with union leaders, who agreed to a package of wage-rises and increases in union rights. The strikers, however, simply refused the plan. With the French state tottering, de Gaulle fled France on May 29 for a French military base in Germany.
