Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\n\n\nWith 140 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, while his career rival Lionel Messi is the only other player to have reached triple figures. Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\n\n\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Raúl, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di Stéfano.[1] He held the record until November 2014,[2][3] when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi.[4][5] Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## All-time top scorers[edit]\n\n\n*As of 8 November

Originally a straight knockout competition open only to champion clubs, the tournament was expanded during the 1990s to incorporate a round-robin group phase and more teams. The expansion resulted in more games being played, increasing players' goalscoring chances; thus the rankings are weighted in favour of modern players: only seven out of the 52 players on the list never competed in the reformed Champions League.\n\n\nWith 140 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, while his career rival Lionel Messi is the only other player to have reached triple figures. Ronaldo has also finished as the top scorer for the most individual seasons in the competition's history, doing so seven times.\n\n\nThe title of highest goalscorer had previously been held by Raúl, who scored his 50th goal in 2005 while at Real Madrid to overtake Alfredo Di Stéfano.[1] He held the record until November 2014,[2][3] when his eventual tally of 71 was first equalled and then surpassed by Messi.[4][5] Ronaldo has remained the competition's outright top scorer since September 2015; after a back-and-forth exchange of the record between him and Messi, a hat-trick by the former against Shakhtar Donetsk put Ronaldo ahead with 80 goals, and he would not relinquish the top spot again after this.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## All-time top scorers[edit]\n\n\n*As of 8 November 2023[7][8]*\nA ‡ indicates the player was from the European Cup era.\nPlayers taking part in the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League are highlighted in **boldface**.  \n\nThe table below does not include

The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition,[448] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[449] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals.[450] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[451] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[452]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n179. **^** \"Ronaldo tops Aragonés record\". *Marca*.

With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022.

These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[474][475][476] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks.

The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition,[448] and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament.[449] On 23 June, he scored two penalties in Portugal's 2–2 draw with France in their final group stage match, equalling Daei's record of 109 international goals.[450] On 27 June, Portugal were eliminated following a 1–0 loss against Belgium in the round of 16.[451] Ronaldo finished the tournament with five goals (tied with Czech Patrik Schick) and one assist, earning him the Golden Boot.[452]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n179. **^** \"Ronaldo tops Aragonés record\". *Marca*.

In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022.

These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[474][475][476] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks.

Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2008 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Casillas\n* RB: Ramos\n* CB: Terry\n* CB: Puyol\n* LB: Lahm\n* MF: C.

Offshore companies in tax havens Uruguay and Belize were used to evade €4.1 million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[676] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football.

Barcelona were crowned champions of Europe by winning the match 2–0, the second goal coming from a Messi header over goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of Spanish football.[92] This success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 September, which committed Messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of €250 million, while his salary increased to €12 million.[81]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10: first Ballon d'Or[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2008 UEFA Team of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK: Casillas\n* RB: Ramos\n* CB: Terry\n* CB: Puyol\n* LB: Lahm\n* MF: C.

An unrelated shell company in Panama set up in 2012 was subsequently identified as belonging to the Messis in the Panama Papers data leak. Messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of €5.1 million in August 2013. On 6 July 2016, Messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay €1.7 million and €1.4 million in fines.[676] Facing the judge, he said, \"I just played football.

During the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMessi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.[538][539]\n\n\nA prolific goalscorer, Messi is known for his finishing, positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. He also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and range of passing.[540] He has often been described as a magician; a conjurer, creating goals and opportunities where seemingly none exist.[541][542][543] Moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker.[532][544] As of September 2023, Messi ranks 5th all time in goals scored from direct free kicks with 65,[545] the most among active players.[546] He also has a penchant for scoring from chips.[547]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMessi made his MLS debut on 26 August, coming on as a substitute in the 60th minute, scoring a late goal in a 2–0 away win against New York Red Bulls, which put an end to Inter's eleven-match league winless streak.[376] Messi's first goal in the regular season earned him Goal of the Matchday with 89.7% of the vote.[377] On 30 October, following his World Cup win with Argentina and Ligue 1 trophy with PSG, Messi was awarded a record-extending eighth Ballon d'Or.[378] Messi finished his first season for Inter Miami with 11 goals in 14 matches, after playing in his final game in a 1–0 loss to Charlotte FC on 21 October.[379] Miami finished 14th in the Eastern Conference, having gone winless in their last seven games.[380]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004–2005: success at youth level[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand the most likable of all contemporary players.[630][631] On Messi's economic impact on the city in which he plays, Terry Gibson called him a \"tourist attraction\".[632]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n680. **^** \"Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2015–16\".

A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou.[48] Capello sought to take Messi to Juventus on loan, but Inter Milan offered to pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages.[49] According to then-president Joan Laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.[50] On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.[41][51]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDue to issues regarding his legal status in the Royal Spanish Football Federation, Messi missed the start of La Liga, but on 26 September, he acquired Spanish citizenship and became eligible to play.[51][52] Wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with Ronaldinho and striker Samuel Eto'o.[29][53][54] He was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first *Clásico* against rivals Real Madrid on 19 November, as well as Barcelona's away victory over Chelsea in the last 16 round of the Champions League,[55][53] which came on back of an intense period of rivalry between the clubs leading a resentful Messi to state, \"We would rather play Arsenal, Manchester United or anyone else than be on the pitch with Chelsea.\"[56] After he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n638. **^** Barker, Andrew (27 August 2014). \"Venice Film Review: 'Messi'\". *Variety*.

He is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\n\n\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer.[4][5] In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de España, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season.\n\n\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 145 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 81 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the third overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Ferenc Puskás (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (123).[6] He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd Müller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\nIn 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award. He has been named to the UEFA Team of the Year twice. He is the third-highest goalscorer in the history of the Champions League. Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd Müller's 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. In 2015, while playing for Bayern, he scored five goals in less than nine minutes against VfL Wolfsburg, the fastest by any player in Bundesliga history as well as any major European football league for which he was awarded four Guinness World Records.[7] Moreover, he has won the Bundesliga Top Scorer Award in seven seasons, most prominently in the 2020–21 Bundesliga where he scored 41 goals in a single campaign, breaking Gerd Müller's previous Bundesliga record of 40 goals, set in 1971–72.[8] On 30 November 2021, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or, just 33 points behind the winner Lionel Messi.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"When I was six, I remember Roberto Baggio at the 1994 World Cup.

However, Gijón rejected him.[17]\n\n\nHe debuted for Lech on 17 July 2008 as a substitute in the first qualifying first leg match of the UEFA Cup versus Khazar Lankaran from Azerbaijan, in which he scored the only goal of the evening in the 75th minute at the Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium. During his Ekstraklasa debut in the first game of the season, in a match against GKS Bełchatów, he scored a heel flick goal just four minutes after coming into the game late second half. In his first season in the Polish top division, he was second in the goal-scoring charts. Lewandowski finished the season with 18 goals in 42 matches.[18] He also scored in a 1–1 away draw against Wisła Kraków in the 2009 Polish Super Cup on 27 July, and converted his attempt in the won penalty shoot-out.

On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer.[191] Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of €45 million, potentially rising to €50 million with add-ons.[192] The contract included a release clause set at €500 million.[193] Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time.[194] Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.[195][196][197][198]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–23: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6–0 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou.[199] On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0–0 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league.[200] On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for *Blaugrana*, netting a brace in a 4–1 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August,[201] followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4–0 victory on 28 August.[202] On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 victory over Viktoria Plzeň, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs.[203][204] On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his sixth league match for Barcelona, in their 4–0 win over Cádiz, breaking Cristiano Ronaldo's record of scoring five goals in five consecutive league games in La Liga,[205] and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October.[206]\n\n\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3–3 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou.[207] Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season.[208] On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David García, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2–1 against Osasuna.[209][210] However, Lewandowski participated in the 1–1 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atlético Madrid, Girona and Getafe.[211]\n\n\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de España final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in *El Clásico*, winning his first title with the club.[212] On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4–2, confirming them as La Liga champions.[213][214] By the end of the 2022–23 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches[215] becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons.\n\n\n\n#### 2023–24 season[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5–0 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[216][217] On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3–2 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century surpassing the record previoulsly held by Samuel Eto'o.[218]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007–2013: Youth level and early international career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski taking on József Varga and Vilmos Vanczák of Hungary during a friendly match in 2011\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007.[219] He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2–0 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.[220][221] Only Włodzimierz Lubański scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10–0 victory.[222]\n\n\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub Błaszczykowski and was named Man of the Match.[223] He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.[224][225]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Assuming the captaincy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing for Poland against Ireland in 2013\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5–0 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain.[226] Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1–1 home draw.[227] Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.[228]\n\n\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7–0 win.[229] On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4–0 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes.[230] On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2–2 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts.[231] Three days later he headed the winner in a 2–1 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France.[232] Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.[233]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-Étienne.[234] Following the 1–1 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time.[235] In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade Vélodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1–1 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost.[236] At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.[236]\n\n\n\n### 2017–present: All-time Poland top scorer[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing for Poland at the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by Włodzimierz Lubański to become the all-time top scorer for Poland.[237][238] On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4–2 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland.[239] He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.[239]\n\n\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[240] Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.[241]\n\n\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships.[242][243] On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2–3 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.[244]\n\n\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty;[245] however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2–0, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination.[246] He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3–1 loss to France in the round of 16.[247]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing against FC Nürnberg in 2019\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world,[248][249][250][251] and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time.[252] An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed *Lewangoalski*.[253] A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet.[254] Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions; despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker.\n\n\nHe has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. Lewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.[255][256][257][258][259]\n\n\n\n## Outside football[edit]\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski in 2010\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer.[257] Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005),[260] was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division.[261] His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno.[261] His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.[261]\n\n\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup.[261] They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).[262][263]\n\n\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic.[264] He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7–1 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.[265]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies.[266][267][268] In the same year, he bought a luxury apartment in Złota 44 in Warsaw.[269]\n\n\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.[270][271]\n\n\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.[272] He practiced playing tennis with Ana Ivanovic, the wife of his friend Bastian Schweinsteiger[273] and knows personally Novak Djokovic.[274][275] He attended his matches in Qatar and United Arab Emirates.[276] In 2022, he personally congratulated Iga Świątek on winning the 2022 Roland Garros.[277] He also plays golf[278] and is interested in motor sports, including Formula One.[279] [280] In 2017 and 2022 as Aston Martin special guest, he attended the Monaco Grand Prix.[281] In 2023, he visited the paddock of Scuderia Ferrari during the Spanish Grand Prix.[282]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy and business[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski (left) featured on a mural in Chorzów alongside Gerard Cieślik and Włodzimierz Lubański, 2019\nLewandowski and his wife, Anna, have supported, donated and raised money for various charitable organisations and for children throughout their career, including Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, for which they've raised more than PLN 150,000 during Anna's birthday party on 25 August 2018.[283] Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gaweł, a three-year-old boy from Hel;[284] and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions.[285][286][287]\n\n\nIn March 2014, he was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[288] In June the same year, he visited a refugee camp in Zaatari, Jordan, and took part in the \"Voice of the Children\" campaign in which he appealed for support of children affected by humanitarian crises.[289]\n\n\nIn 2018, he and his wife donated PLN 500,000 to Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw.[290]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Lewandowski and his wife, Anna, donated €1 million during the COVID-19 pandemic.[291]\n\n\nIn January 2022, he won a charity auction in which he paid PLN 280,000 for Dawid Tomala's Olympic gold medal. The funds were used to finance the operation of a seriously ill boy.[292] Lewandowski subsequently returned the medal to Tomala.[293]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Lewandowski condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and showed his solidarity with the Ukrainian people by wearing a blue and yellow armband during a Bundesliga match.[294] The armband was later auctioned for PLN 27,000 and the money was used to purchase humanitarian aid for Ukraine.[295]\n\n\nBeside philanthropy, Lewandowski also invests primarily in startups, e-commerce, and websites, mainly through Protos Venture Capital, a company of which he is a shareholder.[296] He also owns Stor9\\_, an agency specialising in marketing communications.[297] In 2022, Lewandowski and his wife Anna's net worth was estimated at PLN 625 million (US$ 140 million), making them claim the 89th place on the \"List of 100 Richest Poles\" compiled by the *Wprost* magazine.[298]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship and media appearances[edit]\n\n\nSince 2011 until 2018, he had a sponsorship contract with Gillette and appeared in numerous advertising campaigns of the brand.[299] In 2020, the contract was renewed.[300] In 2013, Lewandowski signed a sponsorship deal with Nike.[301] He also collaborated and appeared in advertisements of Panasonic,[302] T-Mobile Polska,[303] Coca-Cola,[304] Head & Shoulders[305] and 4F.[306]\n\n\nIn 2016, a mobile game *Lewandowski: Euro Star 2016* was released on Android and iOS platforms.[307]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Lewandowski cancelled his sponsorship deal with Chinese telecom company Huawei after the company's reported support to Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lewandowski had signed on as the global ambassador for Huawei, after agreeing to a partnership in November 2015.[308][309]\n\n\nLewandowski featured on the cover of the Polish edition of EA Sports' *FIFA 15* video game, alongside Lionel Messi.[310] Lewandowski's \"X\" goal celebration—arms crossed and index fingers pointing up—has appeared in EA Sports' *FIFA* series since *FIFA 18*.[311]\n\n\nIn 2022, Lewandowski was the most popular Pole on social media.

He is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.\n\n\nAfter being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer.[4][5] In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de España, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season.\n\n\nA full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 145 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 81 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the third overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Ferenc Puskás (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (123).[6] He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd Müller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\nIn 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award. He has been named to the UEFA Team of the Year twice. He is the third-highest goalscorer in the history of the Champions League. Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd Müller's 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. In 2015, while playing for Bayern, he scored five goals in less than nine minutes against VfL Wolfsburg, the fastest by any player in Bundesliga history as well as any major European football league for which he was awarded four Guinness World Records.[7] Moreover, he has won the Bundesliga Top Scorer Award in seven seasons, most prominently in the 2020–21 Bundesliga where he scored 41 goals in a single campaign, breaking Gerd Müller's previous Bundesliga record of 40 goals, set in 1971–72.[8] On 30 November 2021, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or, just 33 points behind the winner Lionel Messi.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"When I was six, I remember Roberto Baggio at the 1994 World Cup. When I was between 10 and 14, Alessandro Del Piero was the best player for me. Then my idol was Thierry Henry. He was amazing – it wasn't just how he scored the goals but what he did for the team.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Lewandowski on his childhood role models[9]\n\nLewandowski was born in Warsaw[10] and grew up in Leszno, Warsaw West County.[11] He took his first steps in football as an unregistered player for the local club, Partyzant Leszno.[12] In 1997, he joined MKS Varsovia Warsaw, where as a teen he played for seven years.[13] The following year he moved to 4th tier side Delta Warsaw, where he finally managed to play in the first team, scoring four goals at the end of the season.[14]\n\n\nIn 2006–07 [pl], Lewandowski was the Polish third division's top goalscorer with 15 goals, helping Znicz Pruszków win the promotion.[15] The next season, he was the top scorer in the Polish second highest division with 21 goals.[15]\n\n\n\n### Lech Poznań[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing for Lech Poznań in 2009\nIn June 2008, Lech Poznań signed Lewandowski from Znicz for 1.5 million PLN.[13][16] Earlier that month, Lewandowski's agent Cezary Kucharski offered him to his former team Sporting Gijón, which had been promoted to the La Liga, Spain's first division, after ten years in the Segunda División.

On 16 July 2022, Barcelona confirmed they had reached an agreement with Bayern Munich for Lewandowski's transfer.[191] Three days later, Lewandowski signed a four-year contract for a fee of €45 million, potentially rising to €50 million with add-ons.[192] The contract included a release clause set at €500 million.[193] Lewandowski became the most expensive Polish player in history and Bayern Munich's most expensive sale of all time.[194] Lewandowski was formally unveiled in front of 50,000 fans on 5 August at the Camp Nou, and was handed the number 9 shirt, previously worn by Memphis Depay, and was officially registered on 12 August, amid speculation that the club could not register him as they were over the league's salary cap limit, due to their financial difficulties.[195][196][197][198]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–23: La Liga title and Pichichi Trophy[edit]\n\n\nOn 7 August 2022, he scored his first ever goal for Barcelona in a 6–0 victory over Mexican club UNAM in the Joan Gamper Trophy pre-season match held at the Camp Nou.[199] On 13 August, he made his competitive debut for the club in 0–0 draw against Rayo Vallecano in the league.[200] On 21 August, he scored his first competitive goals for *Blaugrana*, netting a brace in a 4–1 victory over Real Sociedad on 21 August,[201] followed by another brace against Real Valladolid in a 4–0 victory on 28 August.[202] On 7 September, in his first game as a Barcelona player in Champions League, he scored a hat-trick in a 5–1 victory over Viktoria Plzeň, becoming the first player in history to score a Champions League hat-trick for three different clubs.[203][204] On 11 September, he scored his sixth league goal of the season in his sixth league match for Barcelona, in their 4–0 win over Cádiz, breaking Cristiano Ronaldo's record of scoring five goals in five consecutive league games in La Liga,[205] and eventually registered eleven goal contributions including nine goals and two assists in seven matches, after scoring the only goal of an away win over Mallorca on 1 October.[206]\n\n\nOn 12 October, Lewandowski scored a brace in Barcelona's Champions League fixture against Inter Milan, with his last minute equalizer securing a 3–3 home draw for the Blaugrana at Camp Nou.[207] Despite scoring five goals in the competition, his goals were not able to help Barcelona, as they finished third in the group stage which put them in the Europa League knockout round play-offs for the second consecutive season.[208] On 8 November, Lewandowski was sent off for the second time in his club career for a foul on David García, later receiving a three-game ban, as Barcelona won 2–1 against Osasuna.[209][210] However, Lewandowski participated in the 1–1 tie against rivals Espanyol on 31 December after his ban was suspended by a court in Madrid, but still ended up serving the disqualification, as Spain's sports court upheld the punishment, missing the league matches against Atlético Madrid, Girona and Getafe.[211]\n\n\nOn 16 January 2023, he scored the second goal in the 2023 Supercopa de España final, as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–1 in *El Clásico*, winning his first title with the club.[212] On 14 May, he scored two goals as Barcelona defeated Espanyol 4–2, confirming them as La Liga champions.[213][214] By the end of the 2022–23 La Liga season, Lewandowski won his first Pichichi Trophy with 23 goals in 34 matches[215] becoming the first player in top 5 European leagues to get top scorer award in six consecutive seasons.\n\n\n\n#### 2023–24 season[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2023, Lewandowski scored once in Barcelona's 5–0 home win over Antwerp in the first matchday of the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League to bring his UEFA competitions tally to 100 goals, becoming only the third player to reach such a milestone after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.[216][217] On 23 September, he scored a brace to help Barcelona overturn a two-goal deficit in a 3–2 home victory against Celta Vigo, becoming the best scorer in first 50 matches for the club in 21st century surpassing the record previoulsly held by Samuel Eto'o.[218]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n### 2007–2013: Youth level and early international career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski taking on József Varga and Vilmos Vanczák of Hungary during a friendly match in 2011\nLewandowski began his international career with Poland under-19 in 2007.[219] He would also make three appearances for Poland's U21 team, in friendly matches against England, Belarus and Finland.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHis debut for the senior national team came on 10 September 2008, three weeks after his 20th birthday, against San Marino where he came on as a substitute and scored a goal in a 2–0 away win in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.[220][221] Only Włodzimierz Lubański scored a goal on his debut for the national team at a younger age than Lewandowski, having been 16 at the time. Lewandowski scored another qualifying goal against the same team on 1 April 2009, in a 10–0 victory.[222]\n\n\nPlaying in Warsaw in the opening match of the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament against Greece, Lewandowski scored the first goal of the competition after an assist from then Dortmund teammate Jakub Błaszczykowski and was named Man of the Match.[223] He played in all three games for Poland in the tournament, as the co-hosts crashed out of the group stage with two points earned.[224][225]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Assuming the captaincy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing for Poland against Ireland in 2013\nLewandowski scored two penalties in the 5–0 win against San Marino on 26 March 2013 during the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign, his first match as captain.[226] Later on in the campaign, on 6 September, he scored the equaliser against Montenegro in a 1–1 home draw.[227] Poland did not qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.[228]\n\n\nOn 7 September 2014, in Poland's first UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier, away against Gibraltar, Lewandowski scored his first international hat-trick, netting four goals in a 7–0 win.[229] On 13 June 2015, he scored another hat-trick in Poland's 4–0 defeat of Georgia, with the three goals scored within the space of four minutes.[230] On 8 October, he scored twice in a 2–2 draw away to Scotland, opening and equalising with the last kick of the game to eliminate the hosts.[231] Three days later he headed the winner in a 2–1 victory against the Republic of Ireland, qualifying Poland for the tournament finals in France.[232] Lewandowski ended the campaign with 13 goals, a joint European Championships qualifying record with David Healy's tally for Northern Ireland in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.[233]\n\n\nAt UEFA Euro 2016 in France, Lewandowski did not have a shot on target until the last-16 match against Switzerland in Saint-Étienne.[234] Following the 1–1 draw, he scored his team's first attempt in the penalty shootout victory that sent them to the quarter-finals for the first time.[235] In the 100th second of the quarter-final against Portugal at the Stade Vélodrome, he finished Kamil Grosicki's cross to open another 1–1 draw, and again scored in the shootout although the Poles lost.[236] At the time of Poland's exit, Lewandowski had suffered more fouls than any other player in the tournament.[236]\n\n\n\n### 2017–present: All-time Poland top scorer[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing for Poland at the 2018 FIFA World Cup\nOn 5 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Armenia to take his tally to 50 goals for Poland, surpassing the previous record of 48 goals set by Włodzimierz Lubański to become the all-time top scorer for Poland.[237][238] On 8 October 2017, Lewandowski scored a goal in a 4–2 win over to Montenegro taking his tally to 51 goals for Poland.[239] He finished the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 16 total goals, a record for a European World Cup qualifier.[239]\n\n\nLewandowski was called up to the 23-man Polish squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[240] Lewandowski played every minute in all three matches, against Senegal, Colombia and Japan. Lewandowski did not score a goal and Poland failed to qualify for the knockout phase.[241]\n\n\nOn 19 June 2021, in Poland's second group match of UEFA Euro 2020 against Spain, Lewandowski scored the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw; hence, he became the first Polish player to score in three consecutive European Championships.[242][243] On 23 June, he scored a brace in a 2–3 defeat against Sweden; however, Poland finished last in their group and were knocked out from the group stages.[244]\n\n\nLewandowski was selected for national squad ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. During the first game against Mexico, he missed a penalty;[245] however, in the second match against Saudi Arabia, he scored his maiden goal at a FIFA World Cup as his Poland downed the first match giant killer Saudi Arabia 2–0, ultimately played a key role in condemning Saudi Arabia and Mexico to elimination.[246] He scored his second World Cup goal on a penalty in a 3–1 loss to France in the round of 16.[247]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski playing against FC Nürnberg in 2019\nLewandowski is widely regarded as one of the best strikers in the world,[248][249][250][251] and is considered by many to be one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time.[252] An accurate and efficient finisher with his head and both feet, Lewandowski is a prolific goalscorer, which has led him to be dubbed *Lewangoalski*.[253] A well-rounded forward, he is said to possess almost all the necessary qualities of a traditional number nine: height, strength, balance, pace, intelligent movement and proficiency with both feet.[254] Although he primarily operates as a goal-poacher in the penalty area, due to his positional sense, ability to shoot first time, strength in the air, and powerful shot with either foot, his excellent technical skills, quick feet, proficient dribbling, vision, and physique also enable him to hold up the ball with his back to goal and either bring his teammates into play, or win fouls for his team in useful positions; despite often functioning as a lone-centre forward or as an out-and-out striker.\n\n\nHe has also stood out for his work-rate and defensive contribution off the ball, and is capable of dropping into deeper roles on the pitch, in order to create space for teammates with his movement, or surprise defenders by making late and sudden attacking runs into the area. Lewandowski is an accurate penalty taker and has repeatedly shown coolness and composure on the spot; he is also capable of scoring from long range, and has been known to take free kicks. In addition to his playing ability, Lewandowski has also been praised for his outstanding work-ethic, fitness, mentality, and discipline, both on the pitch and in training, by pundits, players and managers.[255][256][257][258][259]\n\n\n\n## Outside football[edit]\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski in 2010\nLewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer.[257] Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005),[260] was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division.[261] His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno.[261] His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.[261]\n\n\nHis wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup.[261] They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).[262][263]\n\n\nLewandowski is a practising Catholic.[264] He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7–1 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.[265]\n\n\nIn October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies.[266][267][268] In the same year, he bought a luxury apartment in Złota 44 in Warsaw.[269]\n\n\nIn addition to his native Polish, Lewandowski also speaks English and German.[270][271]\n\n\nLewandowski is a fan of tennis and paddle tennis.[272] He practiced playing tennis with Ana Ivanovic, the wife of his friend Bastian Schweinsteiger[273] and knows personally Novak Djokovic.[274][275] He attended his matches in Qatar and United Arab Emirates.[276] In 2022, he personally congratulated Iga Świątek on winning the 2022 Roland Garros.[277] He also plays golf[278] and is interested in motor sports, including Formula One.[279] [280] In 2017 and 2022 as Aston Martin special guest, he attended the Monaco Grand Prix.[281] In 2023, he visited the paddock of Scuderia Ferrari during the Spanish Grand Prix.[282]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy and business[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewandowski (left) featured on a mural in Chorzów alongside Gerard Cieślik and Włodzimierz Lubański, 2019\nLewandowski and his wife, Anna, have supported, donated and raised money for various charitable organisations and for children throughout their career, including Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, for which they've raised more than PLN 150,000 during Anna's birthday party on 25 August 2018.[283] Lewandowski also donated PLN 100,000 for the treatment of Cyprian Gaweł, a three-year-old boy from Hel;[284] and helps raising funds for the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity each year, donating his personal items or private meetings that are sold at online auctions.[285][286][287]\n\n\nIn March 2014, he was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[288] In June the same year, he visited a refugee camp in Zaatari, Jordan, and took part in the \"Voice of the Children\" campaign in which he appealed for support of children affected by humanitarian crises.[289]\n\n\nIn 2018, he and his wife donated PLN 500,000 to Children's Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw.[290]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Lewandowski and his wife, Anna, donated €1 million during the COVID-19 pandemic.[291]\n\n\nIn January 2022, he won a charity auction in which he paid PLN 280,000 for Dawid Tomala's Olympic gold medal. The funds were used to finance the operation of a seriously ill boy.[292] Lewandowski subsequently returned the medal to Tomala.[293]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Lewandowski condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and showed his solidarity with the Ukrainian people by wearing a blue and yellow armband during a Bundesliga match.[294] The armband was later auctioned for PLN 27,000 and the money was used to purchase humanitarian aid for Ukraine.[295]\n\n\nBeside philanthropy, Lewandowski also invests primarily in startups, e-commerce, and websites, mainly through Protos Venture Capital, a company of which he is a shareholder.[296] He also owns Stor9\\_, an agency specialising in marketing communications.[297] In 2022, Lewandowski and his wife Anna's net worth was estimated at PLN 625 million (US$ 140 million), making them claim the 89th place on the \"List of 100 Richest Poles\" compiled by the *Wprost* magazine.[298]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship and media appearances[edit]\n\n\nSince 2011 until 2018, he had a sponsorship contract with Gillette and appeared in numerous advertising campaigns of the brand.[299] In 2020, the contract was renewed.[300] In 2013, Lewandowski signed a sponsorship deal with Nike.[301] He also collaborated and appeared in advertisements of Panasonic,[302] T-Mobile Polska,[303] Coca-Cola,[304] Head & Shoulders[305] and 4F.[306]\n\n\nIn 2016, a mobile game *Lewandowski: Euro Star 2016* was released on Android and iOS platforms.[307]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Lewandowski cancelled his sponsorship deal with Chinese telecom company Huawei after the company's reported support to Russia following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Lewandowski had signed on as the global ambassador for Huawei, after agreeing to a partnership in November 2015.[308][309]\n\n\nLewandowski featured on the cover of the Polish edition of EA Sports' *FIFA 15* video game, alongside Lionel Messi.[310] Lewandowski's \"X\" goal celebration—arms crossed and index fingers pointing up—has appeared in EA Sports' *FIFA* series since *FIFA 18*.[311]\n\n\nIn 2022, Lewandowski was the most popular Pole on social media.

Regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, he is a creative forward renowned for his goal-scoring ability, as well as his technical skills, vision, and versatility on the field.[4][5][6] He is Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider.[7] Benzema won 24 trophies with Real Madrid, including four La Liga, three Copa del Rey, and five UEFA Champions League titles.\n\n\nBorn in Lyon to parents of Algerian descent, Benzema began his career with hometown club Olympique Lyonnais in 2005, contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was named the league's Player of the Year and in the Team of the Year having finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record football transfer when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly rated trio alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed *BBC* — who were integral to four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\nFollowing Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the false 9 position into a sole striker. He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2022, won La Liga Best Player twice and the Pichichi Trophy for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League top scorer as he won his fifth title in 2022, and subsequently captained the club in his final season before signing for Al-Ittihad the following year.\n\n\nA French international, Benzema won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and made his senior debut for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old, he is the third-oldest winner of the award.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nBenzema began his football career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon SC at the age of eight. While at the club, he was nicknamed *Coco* by friends and, after scoring two goals in an under-10 match against the Lyon youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city.[9][10] According to Serge Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused.[11] After talking with Benzema's father, the club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon.[11] Following the trial, Benzema officially joined Lyon and was inserted into the club's academy.[12]\n\n\n\n### Lyon[edit]\n\n\nBenzema quickly ascended up the youth categories in the academy. He served as a ballboy during Lyon senior team matches and performed well in school being described as a student who was \"discreet and respectful\".[11][13] At under-16 level, Benzema scored 38 goals in the *Championnat National des 16 ans*, the domestic league for under-16 youth players in France.[14] Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Benzema was promoted to the club's reserve team, which was playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. Despite only playing with the team during the autumn campaign, he scored a team-high ten goals as the Lyon reserve team finished second in its group.[15]\n\n\n\n#### 2004–2007: Breakthrough and three league titles[edit]\n\n\nBenzema was called up to the senior team for the first time under manager Paul Le Guen during the break leading up to the second half of the season. As is customary with new players arriving at Lyon, the young striker had to stand up and speak to his new teammates, which at that time included the likes of Michael Essien, Sylvain Wiltord, Florent Malouda and Eric Abidal.[16] While speaking, Benzema was subjected to jokes and laughter, which prompted the youngster to declare, \"Do not laugh, I'm here to take your place.\"[16] He made his professional debut on 15 January 2005 against Metz, appearing as a substitute for Pierre-Alain Frau. Lyon won the match 2–0 as Benzema provided the assist of the second goal scored by Bryan Bergougnoux.[10][17] He signed his first professional contract the same month, agreeing to a three-year deal.[18] After making three more appearances as a substitute, on 2 April Benzema made his first professional start in a 1–0 win over Lens.[19] He finished the campaign with six appearances as Lyon won their fourth-straight league title.\n\n\nBenzema began the 2005–06 season under the tutelage of new manager Gérard Houllier. Under Houllier, he struggled for meaningful minutes due to the presence of newly signed Brazilian striker Fred, as well as Sylvain Wiltord. Benzema made his season debut on 2 October 2005 in a league win over Rennes, appearing as a substitute.[20] On 6 December, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in Lyon's final group stage match against Norwegian club Rosenborg. On his competition debut, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 win.[21] A month later, Benzema scored his first professional double in a 4–0 win over Grenoble in the Coupe de France.[22] On 4 March 2006, Benzema scored his first professional league goal against Ajaccio in a 3–1 win.[23]\n\n\nBenzema began earning more playing time in the 2006–07 season and made his competitive season debut in the 2006 Trophée des Champions against Paris Saint-Germain. In the French Supercup, Benzema converted a penalty which drew the match at 1–1. Lyon later won the league curtain-raiser 5–4 on penalties.[24] Benzema opened the league campaign on a quick note scoring in the team's first match of the season against Nantes.[25] Three weeks later, on 26 August 2006, Benzema appeared as a substitute and scored two goals in a 4–1 away win over Nice.[26] He also converted two goals in the Champions League group stage against Romanian outfit Steaua București and Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv.[27][28] After appearing regularly during the autumn campaign, on 10 November, Benzema suffered a severe thigh injury.[29] The injury resulted in the striker missing three months of action before returning in February 2007. Benzema failed to score a goal until the final league match of the season against Nantes as Lyon recorded its sixth consecutive league title.[30]\n\n\n\n#### 2007–2009: Club talisman[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, with Florent Malouda, John Carew and Sylvain Wiltord all departing from the club, Benzema switched to the number 10 shirt and was inserted into the lead striker role. After forming a special relationship with new manager Alain Perrin, he responded with 31 goals in 51 games. He topped the league with 20 goals, scored four goals in the Champions League, one in the Coupe de la Ligue and totaled six goals in six Coupe de France matches, helping Lyon win their first ever double.[31] Some of his more dazzling performances that season included a hat-trick against Metz on 15 September,[32] an equalizing goal in the 90th minute from a free kick against Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne,[33] and a goal against Lens that was nominated for goal of the season by fans.\n\n\nIn the Champions League, Benzema scored an important double against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium on the last match day of the group stage. The 3–0 victory assured Lyon progression to the knockout rounds.[34] In the knockout rounds, Lyon faced Manchester United and Benzema continued to score, this time it was from outside the penalty box in the first leg match which ended in a 1–1 draw[35] and United eventually won the tie 1–2 on aggregate. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and players praised Benzema for his performance.[36] Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas later accused Ferguson of tapping-up Benzema.[37]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2008, Benzema extended his contract with Lyon until 2013 with a one-year extension option.[38] After signing his new contract, Benzema became one of the highest paid footballers in France.[39] For his efforts that season, he was named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year, selected to the Team of the Year and awarded the Trophée du Meilleur Buteur for being the league's top scorer.[40][41] He won the 2008 Bravo Award given to the most outstanding young footballer playing in Europe,[42] and was also shortlisted by French magazine *France Football* for the 2008 Ballon d'Or award,[43] eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\nBenzema got off to a good start for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse.[44] The following three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble[45] and Saint-Étienne[46] and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds.[47] Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100 million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game *FIFA 09*.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema during a training session with Lyon in 2008\nHe scored his seventh goal of the league on 29 October, scoring in the 2–0 win over Sochaux. Benzema scored again the following weekend in a 2–0 win over Le Mans.[49] He was among the top scorers in the Champions League group stage, scoring five goals,[50] a double against Steaua București,[51] two goals in two matches against Fiorentina,[52][53] and a goal against the eventual group winners Bayern Munich on the final match day.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the winter break, Benzema endured a rough patch going scoreless the first three games before recording his 11th goal of the season against Nice in a 3–1 victory.[55] Two weeks later, he scored his 12th goal against Nancy in a 2–0 victory.[56] The next nine matches, both Benzema and Lyon's form dwindled losing four matches, drawing three and winning only two with Benzema scoring only two goals in that stretch, both of them against Le Mans in a 3–1 victory.[57] The bad form resulted in Lyon losing their grip on first-place position and eventually falling out of the title race, thus ending their streak of seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles.[58] Benzema was a part of four of those title runs.\n\n\nDespite losing the title, Benzema got back on track scoring his 15th and 16th goals of the season on 17 May in a 3–1 away victory over rivals Marseille, the first goal being a penalty.[59] He scored his 17th goal the following weekend against Caen in a 3–1 victory moving him into third place among Ligue 1 top scorers.[60]\n\n\n\n### Real Madrid[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009–10: Transfer and adapting to Spain[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 July 2009, it was announced that Lyon had reached an agreement with Spanish club Real Madrid for the transfer of Benzema. The transfer fee was priced at €35 million with the fee rising to as much as €41 million based on incentives.[61][62][63][64] On 9 July, Benzema successfully passed his medical and signed his contract, a six-year deal, later that afternoon.[65] He was presented officially as a Real Madrid player later that night at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, similarly to the previous signings of Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo.[66] Benzema made his Real Madrid debut on 20 July in the club's opening pre-season friendly against Irish team Shamrock Rovers in Dublin, appearing as a half-time substitute.[67] He scored the lone goal in the club's 1–0 win, scoring in the 87th minute.[68] On 24 August, Benzema netted two goals in Real Madrid's 4–0 victory over Norwegian club Rosenborg in an annual friendly tournament organized for the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy.[69] The goals brought his total tally in the pre-season with Real Madrid to five, making him the joint top scorer alongside fellow striker Raúl.[70]\n\n\nBenzema made his league debut for Madrid on 29 August 2009 against Deportivo La Coruña. He started the match, but was substituted out in the second half as Madrid won 3–2.[71] A month later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 victory against newly promoted Xerez.[72] After missing the mid-week match against Villarreal, against Tenerife at the weekend, Benzema scored his first double for Madrid in a 3–0 home victory.[73] He made his Champions League debut for the club on 30 September in a group stage tie against Marseille.[74] After failing to score a goal in the month of October, in the team's first match in November against Italian club Milan in the Champions League, Benzema scored the opener to give Madrid a 1–0 lead. His goal was later cancelled out by a Ronaldinho penalty.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing against Marseille in a 2009 Champions League match\nIn late November, Benzema began appearing mainly as a substitute as manager Manuel Pellegrini preferred Gonzalo Higuaín in the lead striker role. To coincide with his benching, the striker was also being criticized by the Spanish media for his under-performance and difficulties settling in the country as he had not yet begun learning the Spanish language.[76][77] He was even declared the \"new Anelka\" by a Spanish newspaper *Marca* blogger, referring to former Real Madrid striker Nicolas Anelka who had a tumultuous year at the club before being sold.[78] Benzema was defended by his compatriot Zinedine Zidane, who admitted \"after two months, I was also criticized\" and that Benzema was \"a talented player and talented players in Madrid must win\".[79]\n\n\nOn 5 December, Benzema appeared as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart and scored the third goal in a 6–0 romp of Almería.[80] The day after the match against Almería, Benzema responded to the criticism by stating, \"I am totally integrated and very happy at Real Madrid\", and, \"Yes, I have improved my adaptation. I have a new home and I'm learning Spanish to understand myself better with my teammates.\"[81] After nearly a month coming off of the bench, he started alongside Higuaín away to Valencia on 12 December.[82] A week later, Benzema returned to the bench. Following an injury to Higuaín in early January 2010, Pellegrini inserted Benzema back into the starting lineup.[83] After failing to score in his first two starts in the absence of Higuaín, against Deportivo La Coruña on 30 January, he scored a double in an important 3–1 away win.[84][85] Following the return of Higuaín, Benzema was relegated back to a substitute's role and finished the campaign by making eight consecutive appearances off the bench. Included in one of those appearances was his final goal of the season against Athletic Bilbao in a 5–1 win.[86]\n\n\n\n#### 2010–11: First-team mainstay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing in a league match against Villarreal in 2011\nAhead of the 2010–11 season, Benzema switched to the number 9 shirt as Real Madrid were under the tutelage of new incoming manager José Mourinho. The striker immediately drew the ire of Mourinho who declared to reporters during a pre-season media session that \"Benzema must understand that he is extremely talented, but that in itself is not enough\", while also stating that \"[Madrid] need a striker who is sparky, not one that is listless\".[87] Mourinho sentiments were later echoed by incoming France national team coach Laurent Blanc who acknowledged that Benzema was \"not used to working\".[88] Blanc also stated that the striker needed to shed weight in order to fulfill his potential.[89]\n\n\nDue to Mourinho preferring Ronaldo and Higuaín as his forwards,[88] Benzema began the campaign as a substitute coming off the bench in the team's opening league match of the season against Mallorca.[90] Following the September international break, he made his first start in a 1–0 win over Osasuna.[91] On 21 September, Benzema made a substitute appearance and scored his first goal of the season in a 3–0 home win against Espanyol.[92] Afterwards, the striker failed to score a domestic goal for nearly two months.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema celebrating a goal against Espanyol in 2010\nOn 10 November, Benzema scored his second goal of the campaign against Real Murcia in the 2010–11 edition of the Copa del Rey.[93] In late November, Benzema was inserted into the starting eleven following a severe back injury to Higuaín, along with the team's lack of senior strikers. In his first match since being inserted into the starting lineup permanently, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a group stage fixture against Dutch club Ajax.[94] In Madrid's final group stage tie against French outfit Auxerre, Benzema scored his first hat trick for the club in a 4–0 win. The first goal he scored was Real Madrid's 300th goal in the Champions League era.[95][96] Two weeks later, Benzema converted another hat trick, this time in an 8–0 thrashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey.[97] In late January, for the first time in his Real Madrid career, Benzema scored goals in back-to-back matches. On 23 January, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home against Mallorca.[98] Three days later, Benzema repeated his efforts scoring the only goal in a win over Sevilla in the first leg of the team's Copa del Rey semi-final tie.[99] Real Madrid later advanced to its 37th Copa del Rey final in club history after beating Sevilla 2–0 in the second leg.[100]\n\n\nFollowing the arrival of Emmanuel Adebayor on loan, Benzema went unused in two consecutive league matches in February 2011. He returned to the starting lineup on 19 February and embarked on a run in which he scored ten goals in eight matches. Included in those ten goals were doubles in three straight matches against Málaga, Racing de Santander and Hércules, as well as a goal in the first leg of Madrid's Round of 16 tie against former club Lyon.[101][102][103] The strike against his hometown club was the 100th goal of his professional career, and also the first goal for Real Madrid at the Stade de Gerland in six years, though despite the honours associated with netting the goal, Benzema did not celebrate out of respect for his former club.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing in a league match against \nAlmería in 2011\nOn 19 March, he scored the opener in the *El Derbi madrileño* as Real Madrid went on to win the match 2–1.[105] Despite his form, Benzema appeared in only one of the four highly anticipated matches against *El Clásico* rivals Barcelona, in which the two clubs met in the league, the 2011 Copa del Rey Final and the Champions League knockout stage. In between those clashes, on 23 April 2011, Benzema scored a goal in a 6–3 win over Valencia.[106] On 30 April, he scored a goal in the team's 3–2 loss to Real Zaragoza.[107] It was the only match of the campaign that Real Madrid lost, in which Benzema scored.

Mourinho was later credited with Benzema's transformation,[117] but denied full responsibility and, instead, gave credit to the striker himself.[118]\n\n\nIn the second leg of the 2011 Supercopa de España against Barcelona, and with Madrid trailing 4–3 on aggregate late in the match, Benzema scored the equalizing goal to even the tie at 4–4.

Zidane was the first to achieve both honorable mentions. Benzema expressed gratitude at winning the award, stating, \"It is a pleasure to win an individual trophy. When I see the previous winners – Zidane, Henry and other major players – it makes me proud to join them on the list.\"[130] In the team's next match after winning the award, against Sevilla, Benzema assisted two goals in a 6–2 triumph.[131]\n\n\nBenzema opened the 2012 portion of the campaign in positive form.

Benzema was called up to the team for the competition and played in all four matches, scoring a tournament-high five goals as France were crowned champions of the tournament.[248] He opened the tournament by scoring two goals in a 7–0 victory over Cameroon.[249] After going scoreless in the team's next match against Sierra Leone, Benzema responded by scoring a goal in a shutout victory over Nigeria and netting another double in a 4–1 win against Egypt.[250][251] On 19 May 2005, in the team's final match of the season against Slovakia, Benzema scored all four goals in a 4–1 victory.[252] He finished the under-18 campaign with 18 appearances and a team-high 14 goals and was, subsequently, praised by Bergeroo who, following the campaign, declared that Benzema was \"quite efficient\".[253]\n\n\nThe foursome of Benzema, Ben Arfa, Ménez and Nasri returned to international play together for under-19 duty. The four were joined by Issiar Dia, Blaise Matuidi and Serge Gakpé with the objective of winning the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. The team opened the campaign with two friendly matches against Norway. Over the course of the two matches, Benzema scored one goal, which came in the first match, a 4–0 win.[254] In the first round of qualification for the UEFA-sanctioned tournament, he scored his only goal in the final group match against Austria.[255] France won the match 2–0, which resulted in the team progressing to the Elite Round.[256] In the ensuing round, France were placed in a relatively easy group alongside Scotland, Bulgaria, and Belarus. In the opening group game against Bulgaria, Benzema scored a double converting a penalty and scoring in play as France won 4–0.[257] Both of his goals were scored within a minute of each other.[258] After surprisingly drawing 0–0 with Belarus, France faced Scotland in the final group stage match. Benzema opened the scoring in the 11th minute, but his goal was cancelled out by Steven Fletcher in the second half.[259] The match ultimately finished 1–1 and, despite finishing the round undefeated, France were eliminated after being beaten on points by the *Scots*.[260]\n\n\nBenzema made his under-21 debut for *Les Espoirs* under coach René Girard in the team's first match following the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship against Belgium. He started the match and was replaced at half-time by Yoann Gourcuff.[261] He featured in qualification matches for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and appeared as a starter and substitute in the first leg and second leg, respectively, of the team's surprising defeat to Israel in the qualifying playoffs.[262][263] Despite still being eligible to represent the under-21 team until 2009, his appearance in the second leg defeat to Israel was Benzema's last with the team and he finished his under-21 career with five appearances and no goals. Prior to representing France at senior international level, Benzema was courted by the Algerian Football Federation (FAF) who sought for the player to represent Algeria at senior international level. In December 2006, the striker was approached by former federation president Hamid Haddadj and then-national team coach Jean-Michel Cavalli, but turned down the invitation citing his desire to continue his international career with France.[264] Benzema later told French radio station *Radio Monte Carlo* \"Algeria is my parents' country and it is in my heart, but football-wise, I will only play for the French national team\".[265]\n\n\n\n### Senior[edit]\n\n\n#### Euro 2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing for France in 2008\nBenzema was called up for the first time to the senior national team by Raymond Domenech on 9 November 2006 for the team's friendly match against Greece that would be played on 15 November. Benzema described the call-up as \"a reward\", while also stating \"I am pleased, of course, me and my family. A (the senior national team), is the national team's highest honor\".[266] Two days before the match, he was forced to withdraw from the team due to a thigh injury, which he suffered while playing domestically for Lyon.[267] After failing to make the squad for the team's February 2007 match against Argentina, Benzema returned to the team in March for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match against Lithuania and a friendly against Austria.[268] After failing to appear in the qualifier, he made his international debut on 28 March 2007 against Austria. Benzema appeared as a half-time substitute for Djibril Cissé and scored the only goal of the match after a free-kick from Samir Nasri.[269] On 13 October, Benzema scored a double in a 6–0 win against the Faroe Islands.[270] After appearing regularly in the team for the rest of the 2007–08 season, he was named to the 23-man squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2008.\n\n\nBenzema made his debut in the competition on 9 June 2008 in the team's opening match against Romania. Benzema started the match, but was substituted out for Nasri in the second half after a frustrating performance.[271] The match finished 0–0 and Benzema was, subsequently, criticized by the French media for his performance with newspaper *Le Point* declaring that Benzema was \"unrecognizable\" and that he \"symbolized the impotence of France in the attack\".[272] The newspaper also cited his lack of international experience for his subdued performance. In the team's next group game against the Netherlands, Benzema played no part in the 4–1 defeat.[273] He returned to the team in its final group game against Italy and was given a place in the starting lineup.[274] However, France lost 2–0 and were eliminated from the competition.[275]\n\n\nIn November 2008, Benzema, among several other young players in the team, was accused of being insolent during the team's campaign at the European Championship. The accusation came from international teammate William Gallas who inserted the charge in his autobiography. Though most of Gallas' accusations were directed at Nasri,[276][277][278] during the competition, it was reported by newspaper *Le Parisien* that several of the national team players described Benzema as \"arrogant\" and that the striker was scolded by midfielder Claude Makélélé following the team's loss to the Netherlands.[279]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 World Cup omission[edit]\n\n\nDespite the reports from after Euro 2008, Benzema remained a regular in the team and, ahead of qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, switched to the number ten shirt after previously wearing the number nine.[280] In the team's first match following its elimination from Euro 2008, Benzema scored a goal in a 3–2 friendly win over Sweden in Gothenburg.[281] Two months later, he scored another goal in a 3–1 victory against Tunisia at the Stade de France.[282] On 5 June 2009, Benzema converted the only goal of the match, a penalty shot, in a 1–0 win over Turkey at the Stade de Gerland, his home stadium.[283] He scored his first World Cup qualification goals in victories over the Faroe Islands and Austria in October 2009. His cap against Austria would be his last of the Domenech era as he failed to make France's preliminary 30-man squad for the World Cup. Domenech cited Benzema's struggle for form with his new club Real Madrid, rather than his alleged involvement in a sex scandal as his reason for leaving the striker out.[284] Prior to the list being unveiled, Benzema informed *Radio Monte Carlo* that if he was not selected he would be \"very disappointed, but not killed\" and \"I will support the France team no matter what\".[285]\n\n\n\n#### Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing for France at UEFA Euro 2012\nFollowing the World Cup, Benzema returned to the national team under the reign of new coach Laurent Blanc. Blanc, an admirer of Benzema, sought to build the attack around the striker and, after going almost a year without representing France, Benzema made his return to the team in its 2–1 defeat to Norway in Oslo.[286][287] Alongside Gourcuff, Benzema led the team in scoring in qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012, netting three. He scored his three goals in wins over Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luxembourg, and Albania.[288][289][290] On 17 November 2010, Benzema scored the opening goal in France's 2–1 win over England at Wembley Stadium.[291] In the team's next match against Brazil in February 2011, he scored the only goal for France in a 1–0 win.[292] After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, Benzema was named to the squad to participate in the competition.[293] On 5 June, in the team's final warm-up friendly ahead of the European Championship, Benzema scored two goals in a 4–0 shutout win over Estonia.[294] At Euro 2012, Benzema started the team's opening match against England, which ended in a 1–1 draw.[295] In the team's ensuing group stage match against Ukraine, he assisted both the goals in a 2–0 win.[296]\n\n\n\n#### 2014 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 October 2013, Benzema scored his first goal for the France national team since June 2012 in a friendly against Australia, thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the Parc des Princes in Paris, which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home Franck Ribéry's left-wing cross.[297] In the second leg of the 2014 World Cup qualification play-off against Ukraine held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off Mathieu Valbuena's chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised when he turned in Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian goal-line. Ukraine had won the first leg of the play-off 2–0 in Kyiv just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.[298]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2014, Benzema was named in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his debut in the tournament.[299] In the team's first match, a 3–0 win against Honduras in Porto Alegre on 15 June, he scored a goal in each half, the first from a penalty kick. He also took part in the team's second goal, when his shot rebounded off the post and was fumbled over the goal-line by Honduran goalkeeper Noel Valladares for an own goal, the first World Cup goal given by goal-line technology.[300] He was named by FIFA as man of the match for his performance.[301] In the second group fixture, he scored and had a penalty saved in a 5–2 defeat of Switzerland, as *Les Bleus* all but secured qualification to the knockout stage.[302] France were later knocked out by eventual winners Germany in the quarter-final stage of the tournament.[303]\n\n\n\n#### 2016–2020 exclusion[edit]\n\n\nAfter last featuring for France in a 4–0 win against Armenia on 8 October 2015, French Football Federation announced on 13 April 2016 that Benzema would not be picked for Euro 2016 tournament on home soil.[304] This happened after a blackmailing affair involving fellow French team player Mathieu Valbuena (see §Controversies and legal issues). He responded on 1 June 2016 in *Marca*, in an interview entitled 'Benzema: \"Deschamps folded due to pressure from France's racist element\"'.[305]\n\n\nBenzema was also left off the roster for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[306] Directing his frustration at FFF president Noël Le Graët, Benzema later tweeted: \"Mr Le Graët, with all due respect, you've lost an opportunity to remain silent. I've discovered your true face, and this isn't the one that said he appreciated me and wouldn't discuss the subject of team selections!\"[307]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Benzema replied to Le Graët's comments that his career with France was over, by saying: \"If you think I'm done, let me play with one of the other countries I am eligible for and we'll see\".[308]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the squad, Nations League victory and retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 May 2021, following speculation from the media, Benzema was officially included in France's 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020, his first call-up to the national team in over five years.[309] He made his first appearance since his return on 2 June, in a 3–0 home win over Wales, in a friendly warm-up match before the final tournament, during which he missed a penalty, but was later also involved in the final goal scored by Antoine Griezmann.[310] On 23 June 2021, he scored a brace in a 2–2 draw against Portugal, to be his first goals in the European Championship.[311] He subsequently scored another brace in France's round-of-16 match against Switzerland, where France were knocked out of the tournament on penalties after a 3–3 draw.[312] With four goals in as many games, Benzema won the Euro 2020 bronze boot.[313]\n\n\nIn the 2021 UEFA Nations League semi-final on 7 October, Benzema scored France's first goal in the second half as they came from behind to defeat Belgium 3–2.[314] He overtook Zidane in the France scoring records as he scored his 32nd goal for Le Blues to become the 6th top scorer in their history.[315] In the Final three days later, he scored the temporary equaliser as France went on to clinch the title for the first time with a 2–1 victory over Spain;[316] he was named \"Player of the Match\" by UEFA for his performance in the final.[317] With two goals, he was the joint–top scorer of the Nations League Finals, along with Spain's Ferran Torres and teammate Kylian Mbappé, who won the top scorer trophy due to having also provided two assists – Benzema won the bronze boot due to playing more minutes than Torres.[318] The Nations League was Benzema's first trophy with France's senior team and his 27th of his career, making him the most decorated Frenchman in football history.[319]\n\n\nOn 13 November 2021, Benzema scored his first goals in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers with a brace in an 8–0 win over Kazakhstan as France booked their place for Qatar 2022.[320] His brace saw him over-take David Trezeguet to become Les Bleus' fifth all-time top scorer with 35 goals.[321] Although he was included in France's final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, on 19 November, the French Football Federation stated that Benzema would be forced to miss the tournament due to a thigh injury.[322][323] Despite not taking part in the tournament, Benzema was still awarded the silver medal as he was not replaced by another player unlike Christopher Nkunku, who was replaced by Randal Kolo Muani.[324] On 19 December, Benzema announced his retirement from the national team.[325]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\nGenerally known for both his finishing and playmaking,[326] Benzema is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time.[4][5] He is a creative, skillful, quick, agile, and prolific forward, who is good in the air and capable of playing off the shoulders of the last defender,[327][328][329] and has been described as an \"immensely talented striker\" who is \"strong and powerful\" and \"a potent finisher from inside the box\" with either foot, as well as his head, despite being naturally right footed.[330][327] He is considered to be one of the best strikers of his generation, with his Real Madrid manager Ancelotti describing him \"the best striker in the world\" in 2021.[331][332]\n\n\nAn atypical number 9, although he is usually deployed as a centre forward, and can operate as an out-and-out striker, Benzema is also capable of playing in several other offensive positions, and has been used on the wing, or even as a playmaker behind the main striker, either in the number 10 role as an attacking midfielder, or as a deep-lying forward. In addition to his goalscoring, Benzema is known for his willingness and ability to drop into deeper or wider positions, and either link-up play with midfielders, or use his strength and technical ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal to provide assists for teammates, courtesy of his vision, creativity, passing, and eye for the final ball;[nb 1] his playing style led one commentator to describe him as a \"nine and a half\".[337] Highlighting his prolific goalscoring and his creative abilities, Benzema ranks as Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider, with 328 goals and 104 assists respectively.[7][338]\n\n\nDuring his time at Madrid, Benzema has also been praised by pundits for his work-rate and tactical intelligence off the ball, as well as his positional sense and attacking movement as a forward, which often draws opposing defenders out of position, and in turn creates spaces for his teammates; as such, he formed a strong offensive partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo during the latter's time with the club. Indeed, Benzema's movement drew defenders away and created space for Ronaldo to make attacking runs into the centre of the area from the left wing, which essentially saw the Frenchman act as a false 9.[nb 2] Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, he took on a new role as the club's main striker, playing with his back to goal less frequently, and instead receiving the ball facing the goal and taking more touches inside the penalty area; in this position, he also often drifted out wide onto the left flank, while he was able to utilise his control and touch on the ball effectively to create goalscoring opportunities for himself inside the box. The positional change saw an increase in his goalscoring output for the club and an improvement in his shooting, for which he had occasionally come under criticism from the press in the past, as demonstrated by the variety of his goals, his conversion rate, and his clinical finishing with his feet as well as his head; however, in addition to taking over the role of the team's main goalscorer, he also still continued to serve as link-up player for the team's front line by creating chances for his teammates.[342][343]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBenzema in an Adidas music video *(above)* and a commercial *(below)* for Real Madrid in 2019 and 2018, respectively\n\nBenzema was born in Lyon to French nationals of Algerian descent.[11][344] His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Aït Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s.[345] Benzema's father, Hafid, was born in Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, was born and raised in Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon.[345] His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers.[346] The former plays at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron.[347][348]\n\n\nOn 3 February 2014, his then-girlfriend Chloé de Launay gave birth to their daughter Mélia in Madrid.[349] On 5 May 2017, his girlfriend Cora Gauthier gave birth to their son Ibrahim.[350] A practicing Muslim, Benzema observes fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.[351] He has spoken about his faith saying: \"My faith helps me to be focused every day. It brings me benefits and it's my strength for me, my family, as well as for my work – for literally everything.\"[352] In October 2023, Benzema expressed solidarity with the victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.[353]\n\n\nBenzema has been dating American model Jordan Ozuna since 2022, and confirmed their relationship on Instagram.[354] Ozuna is the mother of Benzema's fourth child. In 2023, Ozuna converted to Islam.[355][356]\n\n\nSince evolving internationally, Benzema has participated in numerous advertising campaigns. He was chosen as an ambassador of the American video game publisher Electronic Arts for the *FIFA* series. He has signed several sponsorship contracts, notably with the Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai, the French telephone operator SFR and its subsidiary BuzzMobile, the French bank LCL and the sports betting company bwin. Benzema is sponsored by Adidas.[357] In 2017, his documentary film *Le K Benzema* was released.[358] In 2020, Benzema started his own YouTube channel, uploading videos of his everyday life, as well as interviews and fan Q&As.[359][360] In 2022, Benzema was named official ambassador of the Fendi Faster sneaker line.[361]\n\n\n\n### Controversies and legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 December 2006, he told RMC about his possible selection for the Algerian team: \"It's my parents' country, it's in my heart. But well, from a sporting perspective, it's true I'll play in the French team. I'll always be available for the French team [...] It's more for the sporting side, because Algeria is my country, you see, my parents come from there. France, on the other hand ... it's more of a sport thing, that's it.\"[362] Benzema drew some criticism for these comments, as well as for his reluctance to sing the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise\", before each match with the national team.[363][364]\n\n\nOn 18 April 2010, French television channel M6 reported that four members of the French national team were being investigated for their roles as clients in a prostitute ring operated inside of a Paris nightclub, with some of the women possibly being underage. The players were eventually revealed to be Franck Ribéry, Sidney Govou, Hatem Ben Arfa and Benzema.[365][366] Benzema was alleged to have had a sexual rendezvous with a prostitute when she was 16 years of age, an act Benzema denied through his lawyer.[367] On 20 July, Benzema was questioned by Paris police and indicted on the charge of \"solicitation of a minor prostitute\".[368][369] In November 2011, prosecutors asked for the cases against Ribéry and Benzema to be dropped, saying that the players were not aware that the escort, identified as Zahia Dehar, was 16 years old.[370] However, the case did go on to trial. In January 2014, the judge in the case dropped the charges against both Ribery and Benzema saying there was lack of sufficient evidence that the pair knew the prostitutes were underaged.[371]\n\n\nOn 4 November 2015, Benzema was arrested by French police for his alleged part in blackmailing fellow France international player Mathieu Valbuena over the alleged recording of a sex-tape on a mobile phone.[372] During the investigation over the blackmail plot, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls stated, \"A great athlete should be exemplary. If he is not, he has no place in the France team. There are so many kids, so many youngsters in our suburbs that relate to great athletes. They wear the blue jersey, the colours of France, which are so important in these moments.\"[373][374] On 10 December 2015, the president of the FFF Noël Le Graët announced the provisional suspension of the striker from the French team until a new development in the affair.[375] On 17 February 2016, the judicial review was lifted by the investigating judge who allowed Benzema to get in touch again with Valbuena. On 11 July 2017, the Court of Cassation issued a judgment in which it invalidated a decision of the Court of Appeal of Versailles, which had validated the procedure by which Benzema had been indicted for complicity of attempted blackmail. This decision was made on the basis of contesting the legality of the phone calls recording by the police, and the judgement did not disprove the veracity of the blackmail attempt on Valbuena by Benzema.[376] On 7 January 2021, the public prosecutor's office in Versailles announced that Benzema would face trial for his alleged involvement in the blackmail attempt.[377] On 24 November 2021, Benzema was found guilty of conspiring to blackmail Valbuena with a sex tape.[378][379] The judge gave him a one-year suspended sentence and fined him €75,000.[378][379] His lawyers said they will appeal his conviction.[378] He was sentenced in this case in June 2022 to a one-year suspended sentence and a fine of £63,000, after having abandoned the appeal procedure. Benzema's lawyer indicated their intention to appeal the verdict.[380][381]\n\n\nIn March 2020, during an Instagram livestream with YouTuber and internet personality Mohamed Henni,[382] Benzema made controversial remarks about French player Olivier Giroud, who replaced Benzema in the France national team.[383] He called Giroud \"karting\" while he referred to himself as \"Formula 1\".[384] On 10 March 2023, France head coach Didier Deschamps stated in an interview with *Le Parisien* that he had told Benzema following his injury prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup that there was \"no emergency\" and that he could \"organize his return\" from injury with the team manager. Deschamps then claimed that Benzema made the decision to leave the France team himself, saying \"when I woke up, I learned that he had left\". However, Benzema responded on his Instagram story by reposting the Deschamps statement in the interview with the caption \"but what audacity\". He posted a further story of French Snapchat personality Ritchie repeating the phrase \"liar, you are a liar\".[385]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n*As of match played 10

Regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, he is a creative forward renowned for his goal-scoring ability, as well as his technical skills, vision, and versatility on the field.[4][5][6] He is Real Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider.[7] Benzema won 24 trophies with Real Madrid, including four La Liga, three Copa del Rey, and five UEFA Champions League titles.\n\n\nBorn in Lyon to parents of Algerian descent, Benzema began his career with hometown club Olympique Lyonnais in 2005, contributing sporadically to three Ligue 1 title wins. In 2008, he was named the league's Player of the Year and in the Team of the Year having finished as the league's top goalscorer and winning his fourth league title and first Coupe de France. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record football transfer when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly rated trio alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale — dubbed *BBC* — who were integral to four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\nFollowing Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the false 9 position into a sole striker. He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2022, won La Liga Best Player twice and the Pichichi Trophy for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League top scorer as he won his fifth title in 2022, and subsequently captained the club in his final season before signing for Al-Ittihad the following year.\n\n\nA French international, Benzema won the 2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship and made his senior debut for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest all-time top goalscorer. Benzema was controversially left out of the squad for the 2010 World Cup and did not play for France for over five years after being implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his international retirement in December 2022. He has been named French Player of the Year by France Football four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the UEFA Player of the Year and the Ballon d'Or, becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.[8] At 34 years and 302 days old, he is the third-oldest winner of the award.\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nBenzema began his football career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon SC at the age of eight. While at the club, he was nicknamed *Coco* by friends and, after scoring two goals in an under-10 match against the Lyon youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city.[9][10] According to Serge Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused.[11] After talking with Benzema's father, the club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon.[11] Following the trial, Benzema officially joined Lyon and was inserted into the club's academy.[12]\n\n\n\n### Lyon[edit]\n\n\nBenzema quickly ascended up the youth categories in the academy. He served as a ballboy during Lyon senior team matches and performed well in school being described as a student who was \"discreet and respectful\".[11][13] At under-16 level, Benzema scored 38 goals in the *Championnat National des 16 ans*, the domestic league for under-16 youth players in France.[14] Ahead of the 2004–05 season, Benzema was promoted to the club's reserve team, which was playing in the Championnat de France amateur, the fourth division of French football. Despite only playing with the team during the autumn campaign, he scored a team-high ten goals as the Lyon reserve team finished second in its group.[15]\n\n\n\n#### 2004–2007: Breakthrough and three league titles[edit]\n\n\nBenzema was called up to the senior team for the first time under manager Paul Le Guen during the break leading up to the second half of the season. As is customary with new players arriving at Lyon, the young striker had to stand up and speak to his new teammates, which at that time included the likes of Michael Essien, Sylvain Wiltord, Florent Malouda and Eric Abidal.[16] While speaking, Benzema was subjected to jokes and laughter, which prompted the youngster to declare, \"Do not laugh, I'm here to take your place.\"[16] He made his professional debut on 15 January 2005 against Metz, appearing as a substitute for Pierre-Alain Frau. Lyon won the match 2–0 as Benzema provided the assist of the second goal scored by Bryan Bergougnoux.[10][17] He signed his first professional contract the same month, agreeing to a three-year deal.[18] After making three more appearances as a substitute, on 2 April Benzema made his first professional start in a 1–0 win over Lens.[19] He finished the campaign with six appearances as Lyon won their fourth-straight league title.\n\n\nBenzema began the 2005–06 season under the tutelage of new manager Gérard Houllier. Under Houllier, he struggled for meaningful minutes due to the presence of newly signed Brazilian striker Fred, as well as Sylvain Wiltord. Benzema made his season debut on 2 October 2005 in a league win over Rennes, appearing as a substitute.[20] On 6 December, he made his UEFA Champions League debut in Lyon's final group stage match against Norwegian club Rosenborg. On his competition debut, he scored his first professional goal in a 2–1 win.[21] A month later, Benzema scored his first professional double in a 4–0 win over Grenoble in the Coupe de France.[22] On 4 March 2006, Benzema scored his first professional league goal against Ajaccio in a 3–1 win.[23]\n\n\nBenzema began earning more playing time in the 2006–07 season and made his competitive season debut in the 2006 Trophée des Champions against Paris Saint-Germain. In the French Supercup, Benzema converted a penalty which drew the match at 1–1. Lyon later won the league curtain-raiser 5–4 on penalties.[24] Benzema opened the league campaign on a quick note scoring in the team's first match of the season against Nantes.[25] Three weeks later, on 26 August 2006, Benzema appeared as a substitute and scored two goals in a 4–1 away win over Nice.[26] He also converted two goals in the Champions League group stage against Romanian outfit Steaua București and Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv.[27][28] After appearing regularly during the autumn campaign, on 10 November, Benzema suffered a severe thigh injury.[29] The injury resulted in the striker missing three months of action before returning in February 2007. Benzema failed to score a goal until the final league match of the season against Nantes as Lyon recorded its sixth consecutive league title.[30]\n\n\n\n#### 2007–2009: Club talisman[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, with Florent Malouda, John Carew and Sylvain Wiltord all departing from the club, Benzema switched to the number 10 shirt and was inserted into the lead striker role. After forming a special relationship with new manager Alain Perrin, he responded with 31 goals in 51 games. He topped the league with 20 goals, scored four goals in the Champions League, one in the Coupe de la Ligue and totaled six goals in six Coupe de France matches, helping Lyon win their first ever double.[31] Some of his more dazzling performances that season included a hat-trick against Metz on 15 September,[32] an equalizing goal in the 90th minute from a free kick against Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne,[33] and a goal against Lens that was nominated for goal of the season by fans.\n\n\nIn the Champions League, Benzema scored an important double against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium on the last match day of the group stage. The 3–0 victory assured Lyon progression to the knockout rounds.[34] In the knockout rounds, Lyon faced Manchester United and Benzema continued to score, this time it was from outside the penalty box in the first leg match which ended in a 1–1 draw[35] and United eventually won the tie 1–2 on aggregate. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and players praised Benzema for his performance.[36] Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas later accused Ferguson of tapping-up Benzema.[37]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2008, Benzema extended his contract with Lyon until 2013 with a one-year extension option.[38] After signing his new contract, Benzema became one of the highest paid footballers in France.[39] For his efforts that season, he was named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year, selected to the Team of the Year and awarded the Trophée du Meilleur Buteur for being the league's top scorer.[40][41] He won the 2008 Bravo Award given to the most outstanding young footballer playing in Europe,[42] and was also shortlisted by French magazine *France Football* for the 2008 Ballon d'Or award,[43] eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\n\nBenzema got off to a good start for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse.[44] The following three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble[45] and Saint-Étienne[46] and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds.[47] Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100 million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game *FIFA 09*.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema during a training session with Lyon in 2008\nHe scored his seventh goal of the league on 29 October, scoring in the 2–0 win over Sochaux. Benzema scored again the following weekend in a 2–0 win over Le Mans.[49] He was among the top scorers in the Champions League group stage, scoring five goals,[50] a double against Steaua București,[51] two goals in two matches against Fiorentina,[52][53] and a goal against the eventual group winners Bayern Munich on the final match day.[54]\n\n\nFollowing the winter break, Benzema endured a rough patch going scoreless the first three games before recording his 11th goal of the season against Nice in a 3–1 victory.[55] Two weeks later, he scored his 12th goal against Nancy in a 2–0 victory.[56] The next nine matches, both Benzema and Lyon's form dwindled losing four matches, drawing three and winning only two with Benzema scoring only two goals in that stretch, both of them against Le Mans in a 3–1 victory.[57] The bad form resulted in Lyon losing their grip on first-place position and eventually falling out of the title race, thus ending their streak of seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles.[58] Benzema was a part of four of those title runs.\n\n\nDespite losing the title, Benzema got back on track scoring his 15th and 16th goals of the season on 17 May in a 3–1 away victory over rivals Marseille, the first goal being a penalty.[59] He scored his 17th goal the following weekend against Caen in a 3–1 victory moving him into third place among Ligue 1 top scorers.[60]\n\n\n\n### Real Madrid[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009–10: Transfer and adapting to Spain[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 July 2009, it was announced that Lyon had reached an agreement with Spanish club Real Madrid for the transfer of Benzema. The transfer fee was priced at €35 million with the fee rising to as much as €41 million based on incentives.[61][62][63][64] On 9 July, Benzema successfully passed his medical and signed his contract, a six-year deal, later that afternoon.[65] He was presented officially as a Real Madrid player later that night at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, similarly to the previous signings of Kaká and Cristiano Ronaldo.[66] Benzema made his Real Madrid debut on 20 July in the club's opening pre-season friendly against Irish team Shamrock Rovers in Dublin, appearing as a half-time substitute.[67] He scored the lone goal in the club's 1–0 win, scoring in the 87th minute.[68] On 24 August, Benzema netted two goals in Real Madrid's 4–0 victory over Norwegian club Rosenborg in an annual friendly tournament organized for the Santiago Bernabeu Trophy.[69] The goals brought his total tally in the pre-season with Real Madrid to five, making him the joint top scorer alongside fellow striker Raúl.[70]\n\n\nBenzema made his league debut for Madrid on 29 August 2009 against Deportivo La Coruña. He started the match, but was substituted out in the second half as Madrid won 3–2.[71] A month later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 victory against newly promoted Xerez.[72] After missing the mid-week match against Villarreal, against Tenerife at the weekend, Benzema scored his first double for Madrid in a 3–0 home victory.[73] He made his Champions League debut for the club on 30 September in a group stage tie against Marseille.[74] After failing to score a goal in the month of October, in the team's first match in November against Italian club Milan in the Champions League, Benzema scored the opener to give Madrid a 1–0 lead. His goal was later cancelled out by a Ronaldinho penalty.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing against Marseille in a 2009 Champions League match\nIn late November, Benzema began appearing mainly as a substitute as manager Manuel Pellegrini preferred Gonzalo Higuaín in the lead striker role. To coincide with his benching, the striker was also being criticized by the Spanish media for his under-performance and difficulties settling in the country as he had not yet begun learning the Spanish language.[76][77] He was even declared the \"new Anelka\" by a Spanish newspaper *Marca* blogger, referring to former Real Madrid striker Nicolas Anelka who had a tumultuous year at the club before being sold.[78] Benzema was defended by his compatriot Zinedine Zidane, who admitted \"after two months, I was also criticized\" and that Benzema was \"a talented player and talented players in Madrid must win\".[79]\n\n\nOn 5 December, Benzema appeared as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart and scored the third goal in a 6–0 romp of Almería.[80] The day after the match against Almería, Benzema responded to the criticism by stating, \"I am totally integrated and very happy at Real Madrid\", and, \"Yes, I have improved my adaptation. I have a new home and I'm learning Spanish to understand myself better with my teammates.\"[81] After nearly a month coming off of the bench, he started alongside Higuaín away to Valencia on 12 December.[82] A week later, Benzema returned to the bench. Following an injury to Higuaín in early January 2010, Pellegrini inserted Benzema back into the starting lineup.[83] After failing to score in his first two starts in the absence of Higuaín, against Deportivo La Coruña on 30 January, he scored a double in an important 3–1 away win.[84][85] Following the return of Higuaín, Benzema was relegated back to a substitute's role and finished the campaign by making eight consecutive appearances off the bench. Included in one of those appearances was his final goal of the season against Athletic Bilbao in a 5–1 win.[86]\n\n\n\n#### 2010–11: First-team mainstay[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing in a league match against Villarreal in 2011\nAhead of the 2010–11 season, Benzema switched to the number 9 shirt as Real Madrid were under the tutelage of new incoming manager José Mourinho. The striker immediately drew the ire of Mourinho who declared to reporters during a pre-season media session that \"Benzema must understand that he is extremely talented, but that in itself is not enough\", while also stating that \"[Madrid] need a striker who is sparky, not one that is listless\".[87] Mourinho sentiments were later echoed by incoming France national team coach Laurent Blanc who acknowledged that Benzema was \"not used to working\".[88] Blanc also stated that the striker needed to shed weight in order to fulfill his potential.[89]\n\n\nDue to Mourinho preferring Ronaldo and Higuaín as his forwards,[88] Benzema began the campaign as a substitute coming off the bench in the team's opening league match of the season against Mallorca.[90] Following the September international break, he made his first start in a 1–0 win over Osasuna.[91] On 21 September, Benzema made a substitute appearance and scored his first goal of the season in a 3–0 home win against Espanyol.[92] Afterwards, the striker failed to score a domestic goal for nearly two months.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema celebrating a goal against Espanyol in 2010\nOn 10 November, Benzema scored his second goal of the campaign against Real Murcia in the 2010–11 edition of the Copa del Rey.[93] In late November, Benzema was inserted into the starting eleven following a severe back injury to Higuaín, along with the team's lack of senior strikers. In his first match since being inserted into the starting lineup permanently, he scored his first Champions League goal of the season in a group stage fixture against Dutch club Ajax.[94] In Madrid's final group stage tie against French outfit Auxerre, Benzema scored his first hat trick for the club in a 4–0 win. The first goal he scored was Real Madrid's 300th goal in the Champions League era.[95][96] Two weeks later, Benzema converted another hat trick, this time in an 8–0 thrashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey.[97] In late January, for the first time in his Real Madrid career, Benzema scored goals in back-to-back matches. On 23 January, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 win at home against Mallorca.[98] Three days later, Benzema repeated his efforts scoring the only goal in a win over Sevilla in the first leg of the team's Copa del Rey semi-final tie.[99] Real Madrid later advanced to its 37th Copa del Rey final in club history after beating Sevilla 2–0 in the second leg.[100]\n\n\nFollowing the arrival of Emmanuel Adebayor on loan, Benzema went unused in two consecutive league matches in February 2011. He returned to the starting lineup on 19 February and embarked on a run in which he scored ten goals in eight matches. Included in those ten goals were doubles in three straight matches against Málaga, Racing de Santander and Hércules, as well as a goal in the first leg of Madrid's Round of 16 tie against former club Lyon.[101][102][103] The strike against his hometown club was the 100th goal of his professional career, and also the first goal for Real Madrid at the Stade de Gerland in six years, though despite the honours associated with netting the goal, Benzema did not celebrate out of respect for his former club.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing in a league match against \nAlmería in 2011\nOn 19 March, he scored the opener in the *El Derbi madrileño* as Real Madrid went on to win the match 2–1.[105] Despite his form, Benzema appeared in only one of the four highly anticipated matches against *El Clásico* rivals Barcelona, in which the two clubs met in the league, the 2011 Copa del Rey Final and the Champions League knockout stage. In between those clashes, on 23 April 2011, Benzema scored a goal in a 6–3 win over Valencia.[106] On 30 April, he scored a goal in the team's 3–2 loss to Real Zaragoza.[107] It was the only match of the campaign that Real Madrid lost, in which Benzema scored.

Mourinho was later credited with Benzema's transformation,[117] but denied full responsibility and, instead, gave credit to the striker himself.[118]\n\n\nIn the second leg of the 2011 Supercopa de España against Barcelona, and with Madrid trailing 4–3 on aggregate late in the match, Benzema scored the equalizing goal to even the tie at 4–4.

Zidane was the first to achieve both honorable mentions. Benzema expressed gratitude at winning the award, stating, \"It is a pleasure to win an individual trophy. When I see the previous winners – Zidane, Henry and other major players – it makes me proud to join them on the list.\"[130] In the team's next match after winning the award, against Sevilla, Benzema assisted two goals in a 6–2 triumph.[131]\n\n\nBenzema opened the 2012 portion of the campaign in positive form.

Benzema was called up to the team for the competition and played in all four matches, scoring a tournament-high five goals as France were crowned champions of the tournament.[248] He opened the tournament by scoring two goals in a 7–0 victory over Cameroon.[249] After going scoreless in the team's next match against Sierra Leone, Benzema responded by scoring a goal in a shutout victory over Nigeria and netting another double in a 4–1 win against Egypt.[250][251] On 19 May 2005, in the team's final match of the season against Slovakia, Benzema scored all four goals in a 4–1 victory.[252] He finished the under-18 campaign with 18 appearances and a team-high 14 goals and was, subsequently, praised by Bergeroo who, following the campaign, declared that Benzema was \"quite efficient\".[253]\n\n\nThe foursome of Benzema, Ben Arfa, Ménez and Nasri returned to international play together for under-19 duty. The four were joined by Issiar Dia, Blaise Matuidi and Serge Gakpé with the objective of winning the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship. The team opened the campaign with two friendly matches against Norway. Over the course of the two matches, Benzema scored one goal, which came in the first match, a 4–0 win.[254] In the first round of qualification for the UEFA-sanctioned tournament, he scored his only goal in the final group match against Austria.[255] France won the match 2–0, which resulted in the team progressing to the Elite Round.[256] In the ensuing round, France were placed in a relatively easy group alongside Scotland, Bulgaria, and Belarus. In the opening group game against Bulgaria, Benzema scored a double converting a penalty and scoring in play as France won 4–0.[257] Both of his goals were scored within a minute of each other.[258] After surprisingly drawing 0–0 with Belarus, France faced Scotland in the final group stage match. Benzema opened the scoring in the 11th minute, but his goal was cancelled out by Steven Fletcher in the second half.[259] The match ultimately finished 1–1 and, despite finishing the round undefeated, France were eliminated after being beaten on points by the *Scots*.[260]\n\n\nBenzema made his under-21 debut for *Les Espoirs* under coach René Girard in the team's first match following the 2006 UEFA European Under-21 Championship against Belgium. He started the match and was replaced at half-time by Yoann Gourcuff.[261] He featured in qualification matches for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and appeared as a starter and substitute in the first leg and second leg, respectively, of the team's surprising defeat to Israel in the qualifying playoffs.[262][263] Despite still being eligible to represent the under-21 team until 2009, his appearance in the second leg defeat to Israel was Benzema's last with the team and he finished his under-21 career with five appearances and no goals. Prior to representing France at senior international level, Benzema was courted by the Algerian Football Federation (FAF) who sought for the player to represent Algeria at senior international level. In December 2006, the striker was approached by former federation president Hamid Haddadj and then-national team coach Jean-Michel Cavalli, but turned down the invitation citing his desire to continue his international career with France.[264] Benzema later told French radio station *Radio Monte Carlo* \"Algeria is my parents' country and it is in my heart, but football-wise, I will only play for the French national team\".[265]\n\n\n\n### Senior[edit]\n\n\n#### Euro 2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing for France in 2008\nBenzema was called up for the first time to the senior national team by Raymond Domenech on 9 November 2006 for the team's friendly match against Greece that would be played on 15 November. Benzema described the call-up as \"a reward\", while also stating \"I am pleased, of course, me and my family. A (the senior national team), is the national team's highest honor\".[266] Two days before the match, he was forced to withdraw from the team due to a thigh injury, which he suffered while playing domestically for Lyon.[267] After failing to make the squad for the team's February 2007 match against Argentina, Benzema returned to the team in March for a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match against Lithuania and a friendly against Austria.[268] After failing to appear in the qualifier, he made his international debut on 28 March 2007 against Austria. Benzema appeared as a half-time substitute for Djibril Cissé and scored the only goal of the match after a free-kick from Samir Nasri.[269] On 13 October, Benzema scored a double in a 6–0 win against the Faroe Islands.[270] After appearing regularly in the team for the rest of the 2007–08 season, he was named to the 23-man squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2008.\n\n\nBenzema made his debut in the competition on 9 June 2008 in the team's opening match against Romania. Benzema started the match, but was substituted out for Nasri in the second half after a frustrating performance.[271] The match finished 0–0 and Benzema was, subsequently, criticized by the French media for his performance with newspaper *Le Point* declaring that Benzema was \"unrecognizable\" and that he \"symbolized the impotence of France in the attack\".[272] The newspaper also cited his lack of international experience for his subdued performance. In the team's next group game against the Netherlands, Benzema played no part in the 4–1 defeat.[273] He returned to the team in its final group game against Italy and was given a place in the starting lineup.[274] However, France lost 2–0 and were eliminated from the competition.[275]\n\n\nIn November 2008, Benzema, among several other young players in the team, was accused of being insolent during the team's campaign at the European Championship. The accusation came from international teammate William Gallas who inserted the charge in his autobiography. Though most of Gallas' accusations were directed at Nasri,[276][277][278] during the competition, it was reported by newspaper *Le Parisien* that several of the national team players described Benzema as \"arrogant\" and that the striker was scolded by midfielder Claude Makélélé following the team's loss to the Netherlands.[279]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 World Cup omission[edit]\n\n\nDespite the reports from after Euro 2008, Benzema remained a regular in the team and, ahead of qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, switched to the number ten shirt after previously wearing the number nine.[280] In the team's first match following its elimination from Euro 2008, Benzema scored a goal in a 3–2 friendly win over Sweden in Gothenburg.[281] Two months later, he scored another goal in a 3–1 victory against Tunisia at the Stade de France.[282] On 5 June 2009, Benzema converted the only goal of the match, a penalty shot, in a 1–0 win over Turkey at the Stade de Gerland, his home stadium.[283] He scored his first World Cup qualification goals in victories over the Faroe Islands and Austria in October 2009. His cap against Austria would be his last of the Domenech era as he failed to make France's preliminary 30-man squad for the World Cup. Domenech cited Benzema's struggle for form with his new club Real Madrid, rather than his alleged involvement in a sex scandal as his reason for leaving the striker out.[284] Prior to the list being unveiled, Benzema informed *Radio Monte Carlo* that if he was not selected he would be \"very disappointed, but not killed\" and \"I will support the France team no matter what\".[285]\n\n\n\n#### Euro 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Benzema playing for France at UEFA Euro 2012\nFollowing the World Cup, Benzema returned to the national team under the reign of new coach Laurent Blanc. Blanc, an admirer of Benzema, sought to build the attack around the striker and, after going almost a year without representing France, Benzema made his return to the team in its 2–1 defeat to Norway in Oslo.[286][287] Alongside Gourcuff, Benzema led the team in scoring in qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012, netting three. He scored his three goals in wins over Bosnia and Herzegovina, Luxembourg, and Albania.[288][289][290] On 17 November 2010, Benzema scored the opening goal in France's 2–1 win over England at Wembley Stadium.[291] In the team's next match against Brazil in February 2011, he scored the only goal for France in a 1–0 win.[292] After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, Benzema was named to the squad to participate in the competition.[293] On 5 June, in the team's final warm-up friendly ahead of the European Championship, Benzema scored two goals in a 4–0 shutout win over Estonia.[294] At Euro 2012, Benzema started the team's opening match against England, which ended in a 1–1 draw.[295] In the team's ensuing group stage match against Ukraine, he assisted both the goals in a 2–0 win.[296]\n\n\n\n#### 2014 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 October 2013, Benzema scored his first goal for the France national team since June 2012 in a friendly against Australia, thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the Parc des Princes in Paris, which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home Franck Ribéry's left-wing cross.[297] In the second leg of the 2014 World Cup qualification play-off against Ukraine held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off Mathieu Valbuena's chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised when he turned in Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian goal-line. Ukraine had won the first leg of the play-off 2–0 in Kyiv just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.[298]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2014, Benzema was named in France's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his debut in the tournament.[299] In the team's first match, a 3–0 win against Honduras in Porto Alegre on 15 June, he scored a goal in each half, the first from a penalty kick. He also took part in the team's second goal, when his shot rebounded off the post and was fumbled over the goal-line by Honduran goalkeeper Noel Valladares for an own goal, the first World Cup goal given by goal-line technology.[300] He was named by FIFA as man of the match for his performance.[301] In the second group fixture, he scored and had a penalty saved in a 5–2 defeat of Switzerland, as *Les Bleus* all but secured qualification to the knockout stage.[302] France were later knocked out by eventual winners Germany in the quarter-final stage of the tournament.[303]\n\n\n\n#### 2016–2020 exclusion[edit]\n\n\nAfter last featuring for France in a 4–0 win against Armenia on 8 October 2015, French Football Federation announced on 13 April 2016 that Benzema would not be picked for Euro 2016 tournament on home soil.[304] This happened after a blackmailing affair involving fellow French team player Mathieu Valbuena (see §Controversies and legal issues). He responded on 1 June 2016 in *Marca*, in an interview entitled 'Benzema: \"Deschamps folded due to pressure from France's racist element\"'.[305]\n\n\nBenzema was also left off the roster for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.[306] Directing his frustration at FFF president Noël Le Graët, Benzema later tweeted: \"Mr Le Graët, with all due respect, you've lost an opportunity to remain silent. I've discovered your true face, and this isn't the one that said he appreciated me and wouldn't discuss the subject of team selections!\"[307]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Benzema replied to Le Graët's comments that his career with France was over, by saying: \"If you think I'm done, let me play with one of the other countries I am eligible for and we'll see\".[308]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the squad, Nations League victory and retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 May 2021, following speculation from the media, Benzema was officially included in France's 26-man squad for UEFA Euro 2020, his first call-up to the national team in over five years.[309] He made his first appearance since his return on 2 June, in a 3–0 home win over Wales, in a friendly warm-up match before the final tournament, during which he missed a penalty, but was later also involved in the final goal scored by Antoine Griezmann.[310] On 23 June 2021, he scored a brace in a 2–2 draw against Portugal, to be his first goals in the European Championship.[311] He subsequently scored another brace in France's round-of-16 match against Switzerland, where France were knocked out of the tournament on penalties after a 3–3 draw.[312] With four goals in as many games, Benzema won the Euro 2020 bronze boot.[313]\n\n\nIn the 2021 UEFA Nations League semi-final on 7 October, Benzema scored France's first goal in the second half as they came from behind to defeat Belgium 3–2.[314] He overtook Zidane in the France scoring records as he scored his 32nd goal for Le Blues to become the 6th top scorer in their history.[315] In the Final three days later, he scored the temporary equaliser as France went on to clinch the title for the first time with a 2–1 victory over Spain;[316] he was named \"Player of the Match\" by UEFA for his performance in the final.[317] With two goals, he was the joint–top scorer of the Nations League Finals, along with Spain's Ferran Torres and teammate Kylian Mbappé, who won the top scorer trophy due to having also provided two assists – Benzema won the bronze boot due to playing more minutes than Torres.[318] The Nations League was Benzema's first trophy with France's senior team and his 27th of his career, making him the most decorated Frenchman in football history.[319]\n\n\nOn 13 November 2021, Benzema scored his first goals in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers with a brace in an 8–0 win over Kazakhstan as France booked their place for Qatar 2022.[320] His brace saw him over-take David Trezeguet to become Les Bleus' fifth all-time top scorer with 35 goals.[321] Although he was included in France's final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, on 19 November, the French Football Federation stated that Benzema would be forced to miss the tournament due to a thigh injury.[322][323] Despite not taking part in the tournament, Benzema was still awarded the silver medal as he was not replaced by another player unlike Christopher Nkunku, who was replaced by Randal Kolo Muani.[324] On 19 December, Benzema announced his retirement from the national team.[325]\n\n\n\n## Style of play[edit]\n\n\nGenerally known for both his finishing and playmaking,[326] Benzema is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time.[4][5] He is a creative, skillful, quick, agile, and prolific forward, who is good in the air and capable of playing off the shoulders of the last defender,[327][328][329] and has been described as an \"immensely talented striker\" who is \"strong and powerful\" and \"a potent finisher from inside the box\" with either foot, as well as his head, despite being naturally right footed.[330][327] He is considered to be one of the best strikers of his generation, with his Real Madrid manager Ancelotti describing him \"the best striker in the world\" in 2021.[331][332]\n\n\nAn atypical number 9, although he is usually deployed as a centre forward, and can operate as an out-and-out striker, Benzema is also capable of playing in several other offensive positions, and has been used on the wing, or even as a playmaker behind the main striker, either in the number 10 role as an attacking midfielder, or as a deep-lying forward. In addition to his goalscoring, Benzema is known for his willingness and ability to drop into deeper or wider positions, and either link-up play with midfielders, or use his strength and technical ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal to provide assists for teammates, courtesy of his vision, creativity, passing, and eye for the final ball;[nb 1] his playing style led one commentator to describe him as a \"nine and a half\".[337] Highlighting his prolific goalscoring and his creative abilities, Benzema ranks as Madrid's all-time second-highest goalscorer and top assist provider, with 328 goals and 104 assists respectively.[7][338]\n\n\nDuring his time at Madrid, Benzema has also been praised by pundits for his work-rate and tactical intelligence off the ball, as well as his positional sense and attacking movement as a forward, which often draws opposing defenders out of position, and in turn creates spaces for his teammates; as such, he formed a strong offensive partnership with Cristiano Ronaldo during the latter's time with the club. Indeed, Benzema's movement drew defenders away and created space for Ronaldo to make attacking runs into the centre of the area from the left wing, which essentially saw the Frenchman act as a false 9.[nb 2] Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, he took on a new role as the club's main striker, playing with his back to goal less frequently, and instead receiving the ball facing the goal and taking more touches inside the penalty area; in this position, he also often drifted out wide onto the left flank, while he was able to utilise his control and touch on the ball effectively to create goalscoring opportunities for himself inside the box. The positional change saw an increase in his goalscoring output for the club and an improvement in his shooting, for which he had occasionally come under criticism from the press in the past, as demonstrated by the variety of his goals, his conversion rate, and his clinical finishing with his feet as well as his head; however, in addition to taking over the role of the team's main goalscorer, he also still continued to serve as link-up player for the team's front line by creating chances for his teammates.[342][343]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBenzema in an Adidas music video *(above)* and a commercial *(below)* for Real Madrid in 2019 and 2018, respectively\n\nBenzema was born in Lyon to French nationals of Algerian descent.[11][344] His grandfather, Da Lakehal Benzema, lived in the village of Tigzirt, located in the northern town of Aït Djellil in Algeria before migrating to Lyon, where he eventually settled in the 1950s.[345] Benzema's father, Hafid, was born in Tigzirt, while his mother, Wahida Djebbara, was born and raised in Lyon; her family originated from Oran. Benzema is the third youngest in the family and grew up with eight other siblings in Bron, an eastern suburb of Lyon.[345] His younger brothers Gressy and Sabri are also footballers.[346] The former plays at the amateur level with Vaulx-le-Velin in the Division d'Honneur, the sixth division of French football, while the latter plays in the youth academy of a club in the family's hometown of Bron.[347][348]\n\n\nOn 3 February 2014, his then-girlfriend Chloé de Launay gave birth to their daughter Mélia in Madrid.[349] On 5 May 2017, his girlfriend Cora Gauthier gave birth to their son Ibrahim.[350] A practicing Muslim, Benzema observes fasting during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.[351] He has spoken about his faith saying: \"My faith helps me to be focused every day. It brings me benefits and it's my strength for me, my family, as well as for my work – for literally everything.\"[352] In October 2023, Benzema expressed solidarity with the victims of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.[353]\n\n\nBenzema has been dating American model Jordan Ozuna since 2022, and confirmed their relationship on Instagram.[354] Ozuna is the mother of Benzema's fourth child. In 2023, Ozuna converted to Islam.[355][356]\n\n\nSince evolving internationally, Benzema has participated in numerous advertising campaigns. He was chosen as an ambassador of the American video game publisher Electronic Arts for the *FIFA* series. He has signed several sponsorship contracts, notably with the Korean automobile manufacturer Hyundai, the French telephone operator SFR and its subsidiary BuzzMobile, the French bank LCL and the sports betting company bwin. Benzema is sponsored by Adidas.[357] In 2017, his documentary film *Le K Benzema* was released.[358] In 2020, Benzema started his own YouTube channel, uploading videos of his everyday life, as well as interviews and fan Q&As.[359][360] In 2022, Benzema was named official ambassador of the Fendi Faster sneaker line.[361]\n\n\n\n### Controversies and legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 December 2006, he told RMC about his possible selection for the Algerian team: \"It's my parents' country, it's in my heart. But well, from a sporting perspective, it's true I'll play in the French team. I'll always be available for the French team [...] It's more for the sporting side, because Algeria is my country, you see, my parents come from there. France, on the other hand ... it's more of a sport thing, that's it.\"[362] Benzema drew some criticism for these comments, as well as for his reluctance to sing the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise\", before each match with the national team.[363][364]\n\n\nOn 18 April 2010, French television channel M6 reported that four members of the French national team were being investigated for their roles as clients in a prostitute ring operated inside of a Paris nightclub, with some of the women possibly being underage. The players were eventually revealed to be Franck Ribéry, Sidney Govou, Hatem Ben Arfa and Benzema.[365][366] Benzema was alleged to have had a sexual rendezvous with a prostitute when she was 16 years of age, an act Benzema denied through his lawyer.[367] On 20 July, Benzema was questioned by Paris police and indicted on the charge of \"solicitation of a minor prostitute\".[368][369] In November 2011, prosecutors asked for the cases against Ribéry and Benzema to be dropped, saying that the players were not aware that the escort, identified as Zahia Dehar, was 16 years old.[370] However, the case did go on to trial. In January 2014, the judge in the case dropped the charges against both Ribery and Benzema saying there was lack of sufficient evidence that the pair knew the prostitutes were underaged.[371]\n\n\nOn 4 November 2015, Benzema was arrested by French police for his alleged part in blackmailing fellow France international player Mathieu Valbuena over the alleged recording of a sex-tape on a mobile phone.[372] During the investigation over the blackmail plot, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls stated, \"A great athlete should be exemplary. If he is not, he has no place in the France team. There are so many kids, so many youngsters in our suburbs that relate to great athletes. They wear the blue jersey, the colours of France, which are so important in these moments.\"[373][374] On 10 December 2015, the president of the FFF Noël Le Graët announced the provisional suspension of the striker from the French team until a new development in the affair.[375] On 17 February 2016, the judicial review was lifted by the investigating judge who allowed Benzema to get in touch again with Valbuena. On 11 July 2017, the Court of Cassation issued a judgment in which it invalidated a decision of the Court of Appeal of Versailles, which had validated the procedure by which Benzema had been indicted for complicity of attempted blackmail. This decision was made on the basis of contesting the legality of the phone calls recording by the police, and the judgement did not disprove the veracity of the blackmail attempt on Valbuena by Benzema.[376] On 7 January 2021, the public prosecutor's office in Versailles announced that Benzema would face trial for his alleged involvement in the blackmail attempt.[377] On 24 November 2021, Benzema was found guilty of conspiring to blackmail Valbuena with a sex tape.[378][379] The judge gave him a one-year suspended sentence and fined him €75,000.[378][379] His lawyers said they will appeal his conviction.[378] He was sentenced in this case in June 2022 to a one-year suspended sentence and a fine of £63,000, after having abandoned the appeal procedure. Benzema's lawyer indicated their intention to appeal the verdict.[380][381]\n\n\nIn March 2020, during an Instagram livestream with YouTuber and internet personality Mohamed Henni,[382] Benzema made controversial remarks about French player Olivier Giroud, who replaced Benzema in the France national team.[383] He called Giroud \"karting\" while he referred to himself as \"Formula 1\".[384] On 10 March 2023, France head coach Didier Deschamps stated in an interview with *Le Parisien* that he had told Benzema following his injury prior to the 2022 FIFA World Cup that there was \"no emergency\" and that he could \"organize his return\" from injury with the team manager. Deschamps then claimed that Benzema made the decision to leave the France team himself, saying \"when I woke up, I learned that he had left\". However, Benzema responded on his Instagram story by reposting the Deschamps statement in the interview with the caption \"but what audacity\". He posted a further story of French Snapchat personality Ritchie repeating the phrase \"liar, you are a liar\".[385]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n*As of match played 10
