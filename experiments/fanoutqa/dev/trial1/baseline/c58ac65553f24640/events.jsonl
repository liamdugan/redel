e\n |\n\n\nThe **Cabinet of the United States** is a body consisting of the vice president of the United States and the heads of the executive branch's departments in the federal government of the United States. It is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.\n\n\nThe Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 25 members (26 including the vice president): 15 department heads and 10 Cabinet-level members, all of whom, except two, require Senate confirmation. The Cabinet meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office. The members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away.[1]\n\n\nThe members of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the president, who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in *Myers v. United States* (1926) or downgrade their Cabinet membership status. Often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".\n\n\nThe Constitution of the United States does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet's role, inferred from the language of the Opinion Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) of the Constitution is to provide advice to the president. Additionally, the Twenty-fifth Amendment authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of the heads of the executive departments, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". The heads of the executive departments are—if eligible—in the presidential line of succession.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James K. Polk and his Cabinet in 1846: the first Cabinet to be photographed.\nThe tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1) vests \"all executive power\" in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices\".[2][3] The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.\n\n\nGeorge Washington, the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate).[4] Furthermore, until there was a vacancy in the presidency (which did not occur until the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841) it was not certain that a vice president would be allowed to serve as president for the duration of the original term as opposed to merely acting as president until new elections could be held. It was not until the 20th century that vice presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.\n\n\nPresidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. During President Abraham Lincoln's administration, Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. However, Lincoln rebuffed Seward. While a professor Woodrow Wilson also advocated a parliamentary-style Cabinet, but after becoming president did not implement it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.[3]\n\n\n\n## Federal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 3 U.S.C. § 302 with regard to delegation of authority by the president, it is provided that \"nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the president.\" This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the president within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.\n\n\nUnder 5 U.S.C. § 3110 (also known as the 1967 Federal Anti-Nepotism statute), federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.[5]\n\n\nUnder the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department. These may be existing high-level career employees, from political appointees of the outgoing administration (for new administrations), or sometimes lower-level appointees of the administration.[6]\n\n\n\n## Confirmation process[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historical makeup of the Cabinet of the United States by year.\nThe heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the president and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the \"nuclear option\" during the 113th United States Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by 3⁄5 supermajority to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are sworn in, and begin their duties. When the Senate is not in session, the president can appoint acting heads of the executive departments, and do so at the beginning of their term.\n\n\nAn elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, nor does the White House Chief of Staff, which is an appointed staff position of the Executive Office of the President.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Office\n | Senate confirmation review committee\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Secretary of State | Foreign Relations Committee |\n| Secretary of the Treasury | Finance Committee |\n| Secretary of Defense | Armed Services Committee |\n| Attorney General | Judiciary Committee |\n| Secretary of the Interior | Energy and Natural Resources Committee |\n| Secretary of Agriculture | Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee |\n| Secretary of Commerce | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee |\n| Secretary of Labor | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee |\n| Secretary of Health and Human Services | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (consult)Finance Committee (official)\n |\n| Secretary of Housing and Urban Development | Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee |\n| Secretary of Transportation | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\n |\n| Secretary of Energy | Energy and Natural Resources Committee |\n| Secretary of Education | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee\n |\n| Secretary of Veterans Affairs | Veterans Affairs Committee |\n| Secretary of Homeland Security | Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee |\n| Trade Representative | Finance Committee\n |\n| Director of National Intelligence | Select Committee on Intelligence |\n| Director of the Office of Management and Budget | Budget CommitteeHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee\n |\n| Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\n |\n| Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency | Environment and Public Works Committee |\n| Administrator of the Small Business Administration | Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee |\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Executive Schedule\n\nThe heads of the executive departments and most other senior federal officers at cabinet or sub-cabinet level receive their salary under a fixed five-level pay plan known as the Executive Schedule, which is codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Twenty-one positions, including the heads of the executive departments and others, receiving Level I pay are listed in 5 U.S.C. § 5312, and those forty-six positions on Level II pay (including the number two positions of the executive departments) are listed in 5 U.S.C. § 5313. As of January 2023[update], the Level I annual pay was set at $235,600.\n\n\nThe annual salary of the vice president is $235,300.[7] The salary level was set by the Government Salary Reform Act of 1989, which provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their *ex officio* position as the president of the Senate.[8]\n\n\n\n## Current Cabinet and Cabinet-rank officials[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cabinet of Joe Biden\n\nThe individuals listed below were nominated by President Joe Biden to form his Cabinet and were confirmed by the United States Senate on the date noted or are serving as acting department heads by his request, pending the confirmation of his nominees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Vice president and the heads of the executive departments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: United States federal executive departments\n\nThe Cabinet permanently includes the vice president and the heads of 15 executive departments, listed here according to their order of succession to the presidency. The speaker of the House and the president *pro tempore* of the Senate follow the vice president and precede the secretary of state in the order of succession, but both are in the legislative branch and are not part of the Cabinet.\n\n\n\n\n\nCabinet\n| Office(Constituting instrument) | Incumbent\n | Took office\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Vice President(Constitution, Article II, Section I) | ![](image)Kamala Harris | January 20, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of State(22 U.S.C. § 2651a) | ![](image)Antony Blinken | January 26, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of the Treasury(31 U.S.C. § 301) | ![](image)Janet Yellen | January 26, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Defense(10 U.S.C. § 113) | ![](image)Lloyd Austin | January 22, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Attorney General(28 U.S.C. § 503) | ![](image)Merrick Garland | March 11, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of the Interior(43 U.S.C. § 1451) | ![](image)Deb Haaland | March 16, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Agriculture(7 U.S.C. § 2202) | ![](image)Tom Vilsack | February 24, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Commerce(15 U.S.C. § 1501) | ![](image)Gina Raimondo | March 3, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Labor(29 U.S.C. § 551) | ![](image)Julie SuActing | March 11, 2023\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Health and Human Services(Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953,67 Stat. 631 and 42 U.S.C. § 3501) | ![](image)Xavier Becerra | March 19, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Housing and Urban Development(42 U.S.C. § 3532) | ![](image)Marcia Fudge | March 10, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Transportation(49 U.S.C. § 102) | ![](image)Pete Buttigieg | February 3, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Energy(42 U.S.C. § 7131) | ![Secretary Jennifer Granholm](image)Jennifer Granholm | February 25, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Education(20 U.S.C. § 3411) | ![](image)Miguel Cardona | March 2, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Veterans Affairs(38 U.S.C. § 303) | ![](image)Denis McDonough | February 9, 2021\n |\n| ![](image)Secretary of Homeland Security(6 U.S.C. § 112) | ![](image)Alejandro Mayorkas | February 2, 2021\n |\n\n\n### Cabinet-level officials[edit]\n\n\nThe president may designate additional positions to be members of the Cabinet, which can vary under each president.

vice president of the United States and the heads of the executive branch's departments in the federal government of the United States. It is the principal official advisory body to the president of the United States. The president chairs the meetings but is not formally a member of the Cabinet. The heads of departments, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, are members of the Cabinet, and acting department heads also participate in Cabinet meetings whether or not they have been officially nominated for Senate confirmation. The president may designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as members of the Cabinet.\n\n\nThe Cabinet does not have any collective executive powers or functions of its own, and no votes need to be taken. There are 25 members (26 including the vice president): 15 department heads and 10 Cabinet-level members, all of whom, except two, require Senate confirmation. The Cabinet meets with the president in a room adjacent to the Oval Office. The members sit in the order in which their respective department was created, with the earliest being closest to the president and the newest farthest away.[1]\n\n\nThe members of the Cabinet serve at the pleasure of the president, who can dismiss them at any time without the approval of the Senate, as affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in *Myers v. United States* (1926) or downgrade their Cabinet membership status. Often it is legally possible for a Cabinet member to exercise certain powers over his or her own department against the president's wishes, but in practice this is highly unusual due to the threat of dismissal. The president also has the authority to organize the Cabinet, such as instituting committees. Like all federal public officials, Cabinet members are also subject to impeachment by the House of Representatives and trial in the Senate for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\".\n\n\nThe Constitution of the United States does not explicitly establish a Cabinet. The Cabinet's role, inferred from the language of the Opinion Clause (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) of the Constitution is to provide advice to the president. Additionally, the Twenty-fifth Amendment authorizes the vice president, together with a majority of the heads of the executive departments, to declare the president \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\". The heads of the executive departments are—if eligible—in the presidential line of succession.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James K. Polk and his Cabinet in 1846: the first Cabinet to be photographed.\nThe tradition of the Cabinet arose out of the debates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention regarding whether the president would exercise executive authority solely or collaboratively with a cabinet of ministers or a privy council. As a result of the debates, the Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 1) vests \"all executive power\" in the president singly, and authorizes—but does not compel—the president (Article II, Section 2, Clause 1) to \"require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices\".[2][3] The Constitution does not specify what the executive departments will be, how many there will be, or what their duties will be.\n\n\nGeorge Washington, the first president of the United States, organized his principal officers into a Cabinet, and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since. Washington's Cabinet consisted of five members: himself, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of War Henry Knox and Attorney General Edmund Randolph. Vice President John Adams was not included in Washington's Cabinet because the position was initially regarded as a legislative officer (president of the Senate).[4] Furthermore, until there was a vacancy in the presidency (which did not occur until the death of William Henry Harrison in 1841) it was not certain that a vice president would be allowed to serve as president for the duration of the original term as opposed to merely acting as president until new elections could be held. It was not until the 20th century that vice presidents were regularly included as members of the Cabinet and came to be regarded primarily as a member of the executive branch.\n\n\nPresidents have used Cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extents and for different purposes. During President Abraham Lincoln's administration, Secretary of State William H. Seward advocated the use of a parliamentary-style Cabinet government. However, Lincoln rebuffed Seward. While a professor Woodrow Wilson also advocated a parliamentary-style Cabinet, but after becoming president did not implement it in his administration. In recent administrations, Cabinets have grown to include key White House staff in addition to department and various agency heads. President Ronald Reagan formed seven sub-cabinet councils to review many policy issues, and subsequent presidents have followed that practice.[3]\n\n\n\n## Federal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 3 U.S.C. § 302 with regard to delegation of authority by the president, it is provided that \"nothing herein shall be deemed to require express authorization in any case in which such an official would be presumed in law to have acted by authority or direction of the president.\" This pertains directly to the heads of the executive departments as each of their offices is created and specified by statutory law (hence the presumption) and thus gives them the authority to act for the president within their areas of responsibility without any specific delegation.\n\n\nUnder 5 U.S.C. § 3110 (also known as the 1967 Federal Anti-Nepotism statute), federal officials are prohibited from appointing their immediate family members to certain governmental positions, including those in the Cabinet.[5]\n\n\nUnder the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an administration may appoint acting heads of department from employees of the relevant department. These may be existing high-level career employees, from political appointees of the outgoing administration (for new administrations), or sometimes lower-level appointees of the administration.[6]\n\n\n\n## Confirmation process[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historical makeup of the Cabinet of the United States by year.\nThe heads of the executive departments and all other federal agency heads are nominated by the president and then presented to the Senate for confirmation or rejection by a simple majority (although before the use of the \"nuclear option\" during the 113th United States Congress, they could have been blocked by filibuster, requiring cloture to be invoked by 3⁄5 supermajority to further consideration). If approved, they receive their commission scroll, are sworn in, and begin their duties. When the Senate is not in session, the president can appoint acting heads of the executive departments, and do so at the beginning of their term.\n\n\nAn elected vice president does not require Senate confirmation, nor does the White House Chief of Staff, which is an appointed staff position of the Executive Office of the President.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Office\n | Senate confirmation review committee\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Secretary of State | Foreign Relations Committee |\n| Secretary of the Treasury | Finance Committee |\n| Secretary of Defense | Armed Services Committee |\n| Attorney General | Judiciary Committee |\n| Secretary of the Interior | Energy and Natural Resources Committee |\n| Secretary of Agriculture | Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee |\n| Secretary of Commerce | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee |\n| Secretary of Labor | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee |\n| Secretary of Health and Human Services | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (consult)Finance Committee (official)\n |\n| Secretary of Housing and Urban Development | Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee |\n| Secretary of Transportation | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\n |\n| Secretary of Energy | Energy and Natural Resources Committee |\n| Secretary of Education | Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee\n |\n| Secretary of Veterans Affairs | Veterans Affairs Committee |\n| Secretary of Homeland Security | Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee |\n| Trade Representative | Finance Committee\n |\n| Director of National Intelligence | Select Committee on Intelligence |\n| Director of the Office of Management and Budget | Budget CommitteeHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee\n |\n| Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy | Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee\n |\n| Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency | Environment and Public Works Committee |\n| Administrator of the Small Business Administration | Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee |\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Executive Schedule\n\nThe heads of the executive departments and most other senior federal officers at cabinet or sub-cabinet level receive their salary under a fixed five-level pay plan known as the Executive Schedule, which is codified in Title 5 of the United States Code. Twenty-one positions, including the heads of the executive departments and others, receiving Level I pay are listed in 5 U.S.C. § 5312, and those forty-six positions on Level II pay (including the number two positions of the executive departments) are listed in 5 U.S.C. § 5313. As of January 2023[update], the Level I annual pay was set at $235,600.\n\n\nThe annual salary of the vice president is $235,300.[7] The salary level was set by the Government Salary Reform Act of 1989, which provides an automatic cost of living adjustment for federal employees. The vice president receives the same pension as other members of Congress based on their *ex officio* position as the president of the Senate.[8]\n\n\n\n## Current Cabinet and Cabinet-rank officials[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cabinet of Joe Biden\n\nThe individuals listed below were nominated by President Joe Biden to form his Cabinet and were confirmed by the United States Senate on the date noted or are serving as acting department heads by his request, pending the confirmation of his nominees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Vice president and the heads of the executive departments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: United States federal executive departments\n\nThe Cabinet permanently includes the vice president and the heads of 15 executive departments, listed here according to their order of succession to the presidency.

He previously served as deputy national security advisor from 2013 to 2015 and deputy secretary of state from 2015 to 2017 under President Barack Obama.[1] Blinken was previously national security advisor to then-vice president Joe Biden from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Blinken served in the State Department and in senior positions on the National Security Council from 1994 to 2001. He was a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 2001 to 2002. He advocated for the 2003 invasion of Iraq while serving as the Democratic staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2002 to 2008.[2] He was a foreign policy advisor for Joe Biden's 2008 presidential campaign, before advising the Obama–Biden presidential transition.\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Blinken served as deputy assistant to the president and national security advisor to the vice president. During his tenure in the Obama administration, he helped craft U.S. policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the nuclear program of Iran.[3][4] After leaving government service, Blinken moved into the private sector, co-founding WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm. Blinken returned to government first as a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, then as Biden's pick for secretary of state, a position the Senate confirmed him for on January 26, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBlinken was born on April 16, 1962, in Yonkers, New York, to Jewish parents, Judith (Frehm) and Donald M. Blinken, who later served as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary.[5][6][7] His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jews.[8] Blinken's uncle, Alan Blinken, served as the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.[9][10] His paternal grandfather, Maurice Henry Blinken, was an early backer of Israel who studied its economic viability,[11] and his great-grandfather was Meir Blinken, a Yiddish writer.[12]\n\n\nBlinken attended Dalton School in New York City until 1971.[6] He then moved to Paris with his mother Judith and Samuel Pisar, whom she married following her divorce from Donald Blinken. In his confirmation hearing, Blinken told the story of his stepfather, who was the only Holocaust survivor of the 900 children of his school in Poland. Pisar found refuge in a U.S. tank after making a break into the forest during a Nazi death march.[13][14] In Paris, Blinken attended École Jeannine Manuel.[15]\n\n\nBlinken attended Harvard University from 1980 to 1984,[16] where he majored in social studies. He co-edited Harvard's daily student newspaper, *The Harvard Crimson,*[5][17][18] and wrote a number of articles on current affairs.[19][16] After graduating from Harvard, Blinken worked as an intern for *The New Republic* for about a year.[6][16] He earned a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1988[20][21] and practiced law in New York City and Paris.[22] Blinken worked with his father to raise funds for Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in the 1988 United States presidential election.[5]\n\n\nIn his monograph *Ally versus Ally: America, Europe, and the Siberian Pipeline Crisis* (1987), Blinken argued that exerting diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union during the Siberian pipeline crisis was less significant for American interests than maintaining strong relations between the United States and Europe.[23] *Ally versus Ally* was based on Blinken's undergraduate thesis in which he interviewed Henry Kissinger.[17][24]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n### Clinton and Bush administrations[edit]\n\n\nBlinken has held senior foreign policy positions in two administrations over two decades.[5] He was a member of the National Security Council (NSC) staff from 1994 to 2001.[25] From 1994 to 1998, Blinken was special assistant to the president and senior director for strategic planning and NSC senior director for speechwriting.[26] From 1999 to 2001, he was special assistant to the president and senior director for European and Canadian affairs.[27]\n\n\nBlinken supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[2][28] In 2002, he was appointed staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position he served in until 2008.[25] Blinken assisted then-Senator Joe Biden, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in formulating Biden's support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with Blinken characterizing the vote to invade Iraq as \"a vote for tough diplomacy\".[29]\n\n\nIn the years following the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, Blinken assisted Biden in formulating a proposal in the Senate to establish in Iraq three independent regions divided along ethnic or sectarian lines: a \"Shiastan\" in the south, a \"Sunnistan\" in the north, as well as Iraqi Kurdistan. The proposal was overwhelmingly rejected at home, as well as in Iraq, where the prime minister opposed the partition plan.[30]\n\n\nHe was also a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2008, Blinken worked for Joe Biden's presidential campaign,[5] and was a member of the Obama–Biden presidential transition team.[31]\n\n\n\n### Obama administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken in the White House Situation Room (back of the room, blue shirt, leaning) during the Osama Bin Laden raid, as seen in the photograph named *Situation Room*\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Blinken was deputy assistant to the president and national security advisor to the Vice President. In this position he helped craft U.S. policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the nuclear program of Iran.[3][4] Blinken was sworn in as deputy national security advisor, succeeding Denis McDonough, on January 20, 2013.[32]\n\n\nOn November 7, 2014, President Obama announced that he would nominate Blinken for the deputy secretary post, replacing the retiring William J. Burns.[33] On December 16, 2014, Blinken was confirmed as Deputy Secretary of State by the Senate by a vote of 55 to 38.[34]\n\n\nOf Obama's 2011 decision to kill Osama bin Laden, Blinken said \"I've never seen a more courageous decision made by a leader.\"[35] A 2013 profile described him as \"one of the government's key players in drafting Syria policy\",[5] for which he served as a public face.[36] Blinken was influential in formulating the Obama administration's response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.[37][38]\n\n\nBlinken supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya[36] and the supply of weapons to Syrian rebels.[39] He condemned the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt and expressed support for the democratically elected Turkish government and its institutions, but also criticized the 2016–present purges in Turkey.[40] In April 2015, Blinken voiced support for the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen.[41] He said that \"as part of that effort, we have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the Saudi operation centre.\"[42]\n\n\nBlinken worked with Biden on requests for American money to replenish Israel's arsenal of Iron Dome interceptor missiles during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[43] In May 2015, Blinken criticized the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar and warned Myanmar's leaders about the dangers of anti-Muslim legislation,[44] saying that Rohingya Muslims \"should have a path to citizenship. The uncertainty that comes from not having any status is one of the things that may drive people to leave.\"[45]\n\n\nIn June 2015, Blinken claimed that more than ten thousand ISIL fighters had been killed by American-led airstrikes against the Islamic State since a U.S.-led coalition launched a campaign against it nine months previously.[46]\n\n\n\n\n### Penn Biden Center[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Blinken served as the managing director of the Penn Biden Center, a University of Pennsylvania think tank.[47] During this time he published several articles on foreign policy and the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n### Private sector[edit]\n\n\n#### WestExec Advisors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Blinken co-founded WestExec Advisors, a political strategy advising firm, with Michèle Flournoy, Sergio Aguirre, and Nitin Chadda.[48][49] WestExec's clients have included Google's Jigsaw, Israeli artificial-intelligence company Windward, surveillance drone manufacturer Shield AI, which signed a $7.2 million contract with the Air Force,[50] and \"*Fortune* 100 types\".[51] According to *Foreign Policy*, the firm's clientele includes \"the defense industry, private equity firms, and hedge funds\".[52] Blinken received almost $1.2 million in compensation from WestExec.[53]\n\n\nIn an interview with *The Intercept*, Flournoy described WestExec's role as facilitating relationships between Silicon Valley firms and the Department of Defense and law enforcement;[54] Flournoy and others compared WestExec to Kissinger Associates.[54][55]\n\n\n\n#### Pine Island Capital Partners[edit]\n\n\nBlinken, as well as other Biden transition team members Michele Flournoy, former Pentagon advisor, and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, are partners of private equity firm Pine Island Capital Partners,[56][57] a strategic partner of WestExec.[58] Pine Island's chairman is John Thain, the final chairman of Merrill Lynch before its sale to Bank of America.[59] Blinken went on leave from Pine Island in August 2020 to join the Biden campaign as a senior foreign policy advisor.[57] He said he would divest himself of his equity stake in Pine Island if confirmed for a position in the Biden administration.[58]\n\n\nDuring the final stretch of Biden's presidential campaign, Pine Island raised $218 million for a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a public offering to invest in \"defense, government service and aerospace industries\" and COVID-19 relief, which the firm's prospectus (initially filed with the U.S. SEC in September and finalized on November 13, 2020) predicted would be profitable as the government looked to private contractors to address the pandemic.[57] Thain said he chose the other partners because of their \"access, network and expertise\".[50]\n\n\nIn a December 2020 *New York Times* article raising questions about potential conflicts of interest between WestExec principals, Pine Island advisors, including Blinken, and service in the Biden administration, critics called for full disclosure of all WestExec/Pine Island financial relationships, divestiture of ownership stakes in companies bidding on government contracts or enjoying existing contracts, and assurances that Blinken and others recuse themselves from decisions that might advantage their previous clients.[50]\n\n\nBlinken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations[60] and was previously a global affairs analyst for CNN.[61][62]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of state[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken being sworn in as Secretary of State at the U.S. State Department on January 26, 2021.\nBlinken was a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[63]\nOn November 22, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Biden had selected Blinken as his nominee for secretary of state.[64] These reports were later corroborated by *The New York Times* and other outlets.[30][65][64] On November 24, upon being announced as Biden's choice for secretary of state, Blinken said, \"We can't solve all the world's problems alone [and] we need to be working with other countries.\"[66] He had earlier remarked in a September 2020 interview with the Associated Press that \"democracy is in retreat around the world, and unfortunately it's also in retreat at home because of the president taking a two-by-four to its institutions, its values and its people every day.\"[67]\n\n\nBlinken's confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 19, 2021. His nomination was confirmed by the committee on January 25 with a vote of 15–3.[68] On January 26, Blinken was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 78–22.[1] Blinken took the oath of office of the secretary of state later that day.[69] In doing so, he became the third former deputy secretary of state to serve as the Secretary of State, after Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren Christopher in 1992 and 1993, respectively.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international trips made by Antony Blinken as United States Secretary of State\n\n#### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nOn January 31, 2021, Blinken condemned the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état and expressed grave concerns on the detention of government officials and civil society leaders, calling for their immediate release.[72] He stated that, \"the United States will continue to take firm action against those who perpetrate violence against the people of Burma as they demand the restoration of their democratically elected government.\"[73]\n\n\n\n#### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, having spoken to president Ashraf Ghani, Blinken voiced support for Afghan peace negotiations with Taliban Islamist rebels and reiterated the United States' commitment to a peace deal that includes a \"just and durable political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.\"[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blinken meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to discuss U.S. troop withdrawal\nBlinken made an unannounced visit to Kabul on April 15 and met with U.S. military and diplomatic personnel following the Biden administration's announcement of the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.[75] He said the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was made to focus resources on China and the COVID-19 pandemic.[76] He faced calls to resign as secretary of state following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.[77][78][79][80]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Blinken rejected comparisons between the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan due to the Taliban offensive, which started in May 2021 after U.S. and coalition military forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan, and the chaotic American departure from Saigon in 1975, saying that \"We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission, and that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11 and we have succeeded in that mission.\"[81]\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken meeting with Kenyan President William Ruto on September 21, 2022\nIn February 2021, Blinken condemned ethnic cleansing in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia and called for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and other fighters.[82][83]\n\n\nIn the midst of the Biden administration's continuing review of the normalization agreement between Morocco and Israel enacted during the previous administration, Blinken maintained that the recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which was annexed by Morocco in 1975, will not be reversed imminently. During internal discussions, he supported improving relations between the two countries and expressed urgency in appointing a United Nations envoy to Western Sahara.[84][85]\n\n\nIn March 2023, he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa to normalize relations between the United States and Ethiopia that were strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[86]\n\n\n\n#### South America[edit]\n\n\nBlinken spoke with the interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, whom the Biden administration will continue to recognize as the country's head of state and not Nicolás Maduro.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Asia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Manila on August 6, 2022\nBlinken made his first international trip with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Tokyo and Seoul on March 15, during which he warned China against coercion and aggression.[88][89] He also condemned the Chinese government for committing genocide against ethnic Uyghurs.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Biden administration accused China of a global cyberespionage campaign, which Blinken said posed \"a major threat to our economic and national security\".[91]\n\n\nIn late April 2021, Blinken denounced the sentencing of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Jimmy Lai, Albert Ho, and Lee Cheuk-yan among others, for their roles in the 2019 Hong Kong protests, calling it a \"politically-motivated\" decision.[92][93]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Blinken stated that \"China is the one country that has the intention as well as the economic, technological, military and diplomatic means to advance a different vision of international order.\"[94] He dismissed China's claims to be neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War and accused China of supporting Russia.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip to Beijing. According to the State Department's readout, Blinken \"emphasized the importance of maintaining open channels of communication across the full range of issues to reduce the risk of miscalculation\" and \"made clear that while we will compete vigorously, the United States will responsibly manage that competition so that the relationship does not veer into conflict.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### G7 meeting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken meets with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bali, Indonesia, on July 9, 2022\nIn May 2021, Blinken traveled to London and Reykjavík for the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers' meeting and the Arctic Council Ministerial meeting respectively.[97][98] In a meeting with president Volodymyr Zelensky and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv, Blinken reaffirmed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity against \"Russian aggression\".[99] During the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Blinken expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself but warned that evicting Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem is among the actions that could further escalate outbreaks of violence and retaliation.[100][101] He, along with the United Nations Security Council, called for full adherence to the truce and stressed the immediate need for humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians while reiterating the need for a two-state solution.[102] Following the ceasefire and coinciding Blinken's visit to Jerusalem on May 25, the transfer of food and medical supplies furnished by the United Nations and Physicians for Human Rights, aid workers, and journalists were permitted into the Gaza Strip.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken in group meeting with German FM Maas, Turkish FM Çavuşoğlu, British FM Raab, Italian FM Di Maio, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin, April 2021\nThe decision to waive sanctions against Nord Stream AG and its chief executive Matthias Warnig, subsequent to the completion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, drew congressional criticisms.[104] Blinken defended the action as pragmatic and practical to U.S. interests and remarked that proceeding otherwise would be counterproductive with European relations.[104] In June 2021, Blinken traveled with Biden to attend the 47th G7 summit in Cornwall, the 31st NATO summit in Brussels, and the summit meeting with president Vladimir Putin in Geneva.[105] Blinken and Biden both acknowledged that relations between the U.S. and Russia were at their lowest point, and a more predictable relationship remained a key priority.[106] However, he signaled that further punitive actions would be enforced if the Russian government chose to continue with hostile activities such as interference in the 2020 presidential elections, the SolarWinds cyberattack, or the apparent poisoning and imprisonment of Alexei Navalny.[106] Of the administration's decision to forgo a joint press conference after the summit, Blinken explained that it was \"the most effective way\" and \"not a rare practice\".[107]\n\n\nLater that month, Blinken traveled to Brussels for a NATO Ministerial with European Union counterparts to underscore the Biden administration's determination to strengthen transatlantic alliances.\n\n\nBlinken has been a co-chair of the Trade and Technology Council since its creation in 2021 to encourage trade relations with the European Union.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Russia-Ukraine war[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv in 2022. As Secretary of State, Blinken has been deeply involved in the American response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn January 2022, Blinken authorized the supply of weapons to Ukraine to support the Eastern European country in amid border tensions with Russia.[109][110] On January 19, 2022, at a joint press availability with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Blinken said \"One of the principles which you’ve heard us repeat – but it always bears repeating – is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.[111] February 11, Blinken publicly warned about the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine prior to the end the 2022 Winter Olympics.[112] On February 13, Blinken said the risk of invasion was \"high enough and the threat is imminent enough\" that the evacuation of most staff from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv was \"the prudent thing to do\".[113] In September 2022, Blinken pledged that the United States would help the Ukrainian military retake Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.[114] He criticized Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons, saying that \"Russia has gotten itself into the mess that it's in is because there is no one in the [autocratic] system to effectively tell Putin he's doing the wrong thing.\"[115]\n\n\nRegarding the countries that decided to be neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine, Blinken said that \"It's pretty hard to be neutral when it comes to this aggression. There is a clear aggressor. There is a clear victim.\"[116]\n\n\nSpeaking about the 2022 Russian mobilization, he said that mobilized Russian civilians were being treated as \"cannon fodder that Putin is trying to throw into the war.\"[117] On October 21, 2022, Blinken said the United States saw no willingness on the side of Russia to end its war in Ukraine by diplomatic means, despite American attempts.[118] Blinken questioned China's peace proposal, saying \"the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms.\"[119] In June 2023, he rejected any \"cease-fire that simply freezes current lines in place\".[120] In July 2023, he defended Biden's decision to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Americans detained abroad[edit]\n\n\nBlinken and the Biden administration have been criticized for the handling of Americans who are wrongfully imprisoned abroad. Families of U.S. detainees in the Middle East were upset that they were left off of a call with Secretary Blinken.[122] In July 2022, Blinken had a meeting with Sergey Lavrov to discuss a prisoner swap to secure the release of Paul Whelan (security director) and Brittney Griner.[123] Blinken has met with the Bring Our Families Home campaign, a coalition of families with loved ones detained abroad.[124]\n\n\nBlinken, along with the work of Special Presidential Envoy of Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens, has negotiated the release of over a dozen Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad including Trevor Reed, Danny Fenster, Baquer Namazi, the entire Citgo Six, Osman Khan, Matthew John Heath, Mark Frerichs, and Jorge Alberto Fernández.\n\n\n\n## Foreign policy positions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign policy of the Joe Biden administration\n\n![](image)Blinken with Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, January 18, 2016\nAs foreign policy advisor to then 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, *The New York Times* described Blinken as \"ha[ving] Biden's ear on policy issues\".[125] His foreign policy positions have been described as hawkish.[126] Blinken has asserted that \"[Biden] would not tie military assistance to Israel to things like annexation or other decisions by the Israeli government with which we might disagree\".[127] Blinken praised the Trump administration-brokered normalization agreements between Israel and Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.[128][129] On October 28, 2020, Blinken reaffirmed that a Biden administration will undertake strategic review of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, ensuring that it advances U.S interests and values.[130] In January 2021, Blinken has stated the Biden administration would keep the American embassy to Israel in Jerusalem and would seek a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[131]\nBlinken is in favor of continuing non-nuclear sanctions against Iran and described it as \"a strong hedge against Iranian misbehavior in other areas\".[128] He criticized former president Trump's withdrawal of the U.S. from the international nuclear agreement with Iran and expressed support for a \"longer and stronger\" nuclear deal.[132][133] Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.[134][135]\n\n\nBlinken has been critical of the Trump administration in aiding China to advance its own key strategic goals. He stated: \"[Trump] weaken[ed] American alliances, leaving a vacuum in the world for China to fill, abandoning our values and giving China a green light to trample on human rights and democracy from Xinjiang to Hong Kong\".[136] However, he also credited the former president's administration for its aggressive approach and has characterized China as a \"techno-autocracy\" which seeks world dominance.[137][138] He indicated a desire to welcome political refugees from Hong Kong and stated that the Biden administration's commitment to Taiwan's defense would \"absolutely endure\", and that China's use of military force against Taiwan \"would be a grievous mistake on their part\".[138] Blinken has also viewed China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its northwestern region of Xinjiang.[139] Blinken has characterized former president Trump's Phase One trade deal with China as \"a debacle\".[140] He said it was unrealistic to \"fully decouple\" from China and has expressed support for \"stronger economic ties with Taiwan\".[140][141]\n\n\nBlinken has indicated American interest in robust ties between itself, Greece, Israel, and Cyprus regarding the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act and acknowledged the threats posed by an expansionist Turkey, which is \"not acting like an ally\".[142] He opposed Turkish president Recep Erdogan's call for \"a two-state solution in Cyprus\", saying the Biden administration is committed to the reunification of Cyprus.[40][143] Blinken has also suggested that he would consider sanctioning the Erdogan administration.[144] Blinken reaffirmed his support of keeping NATO's door open for Georgia, a country in the Caucasus, and raised the argument that NATO member countries have been more effectively shielded from \"Russian aggression\".[145]\n\n\nBlinken expressed his support of extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia to limit the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads.[30][146] Blinken said the Biden administration will \"review\" security assistance to Azerbaijan due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and voiced his support for \"the provision to Armenia of security assistance\".[147]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blinken with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 16, 2023\nBlinken is opposed to the United Kingdom's separation from the European Union and has referred to it as a \"total mess\" with consequences adverse to U.S. interest.[148][149] Blinken expressed concern over perceived human rights violations in Egypt under the presidency of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.[150] He condemned the arrest of three employees for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights organization, saying that \"meeting with foreign diplomats is not a crime. Nor is peacefully advocating for human rights.\"[151] Referring to the re-instated Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, declared by the Taliban following their 2021 capture of Kabul, Blinken has stated that the United States will not recognize any government that harbors terrorist groups or that does not uphold basic human rights.[152]\n\n\nDuring a visit to Tel Aviv, following the Hamas attack on Israel, Blinken promised to help defend Israel \"as long as America exists.\" Blinken said that \"Israel has the right, indeed the obligation, to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again.\"[153] He rejected calls for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBlinken is Jewish.[155] In 2002, Blinken and Evan Ryan were married in an interfaith ceremony officiated by a rabbi and a priest at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, D.C.[20][5] They have two children.[156] Blinken is fluent in French.[157] He plays the guitar and has three songs available on Spotify by the alias Ablinken[158] (pronounced \"Abe Lincoln\").[159] Blinken gave a cover performance of \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" by Muddy Waters in September 2023 to launch the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative.[160]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Blinken, Antony J.

He previously served as deputy national security advisor from 2013 to 2015 and deputy secretary of state from 2015 to 2017 under President Barack Obama.[1] Blinken was previously national security advisor to then-vice president Joe Biden from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Blinken served in the State Department and in senior positions on the National Security Council from 1994 to 2001. He was a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 2001 to 2002. He advocated for the 2003 invasion of Iraq while serving as the Democratic staff director of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2002 to 2008.[2] He was a foreign policy advisor for Joe Biden's 2008 presidential campaign, before advising the Obama–Biden presidential transition.\n\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Blinken served as deputy assistant to the president and national security advisor to the vice president. During his tenure in the Obama administration, he helped craft U.S. policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the nuclear program of Iran.[3][4] After leaving government service, Blinken moved into the private sector, co-founding WestExec Advisors, a consulting firm. Blinken returned to government first as a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign, then as Biden's pick for secretary of state, a position the Senate confirmed him for on January 26, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBlinken was born on April 16, 1962, in Yonkers, New York, to Jewish parents, Judith (Frehm) and Donald M. Blinken, who later served as the U.S. ambassador to Hungary.[5][6][7] His maternal grandparents were Hungarian Jews.[8] Blinken's uncle, Alan Blinken, served as the U.S. ambassador to Belgium.[9][10] His paternal grandfather, Maurice Henry Blinken, was an early backer of Israel who studied its economic viability,[11] and his great-grandfather was Meir Blinken, a Yiddish writer.[12]\n\n\nBlinken attended Dalton School in New York City until 1971.[6] He then moved to Paris with his mother Judith and Samuel Pisar, whom she married following her divorce from Donald Blinken. In his confirmation hearing, Blinken told the story of his stepfather, who was the only Holocaust survivor of the 900 children of his school in Poland. Pisar found refuge in a U.S. tank after making a break into the forest during a Nazi death march.[13][14] In Paris, Blinken attended École Jeannine Manuel.[15]\n\n\nBlinken attended Harvard University from 1980 to 1984,[16] where he majored in social studies. He co-edited Harvard's daily student newspaper, *The Harvard Crimson,*[5][17][18] and wrote a number of articles on current affairs.[19][16] After graduating from Harvard, Blinken worked as an intern for *The New Republic* for about a year.[6][16] He earned a J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1988[20][21] and practiced law in New York City and Paris.[22] Blinken worked with his father to raise funds for Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in the 1988 United States presidential election.[5]\n\n\nIn his monograph *Ally versus Ally: America, Europe, and the Siberian Pipeline Crisis* (1987), Blinken argued that exerting diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union during the Siberian pipeline crisis was less significant for American interests than maintaining strong relations between the United States and Europe.[23] *Ally versus Ally* was based on Blinken's undergraduate thesis in which he interviewed Henry Kissinger.[17][24]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n### Clinton and Bush administrations[edit]\n\n\nBlinken has held senior foreign policy positions in two administrations over two decades.[5] He was a member of the National Security Council (NSC) staff from 1994 to 2001.[25] From 1994 to 1998, Blinken was special assistant to the president and senior director for strategic planning and NSC senior director for speechwriting.[26] From 1999 to 2001, he was special assistant to the president and senior director for European and Canadian affairs.[27]\n\n\nBlinken supported the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.[2][28] In 2002, he was appointed staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position he served in until 2008.[25] Blinken assisted then-Senator Joe Biden, Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in formulating Biden's support for the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with Blinken characterizing the vote to invade Iraq as \"a vote for tough diplomacy\".[29]\n\n\nIn the years following the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, Blinken assisted Biden in formulating a proposal in the Senate to establish in Iraq three independent regions divided along ethnic or sectarian lines: a \"Shiastan\" in the south, a \"Sunnistan\" in the north, as well as Iraqi Kurdistan. The proposal was overwhelmingly rejected at home, as well as in Iraq, where the prime minister opposed the partition plan.[30]\n\n\nHe was also a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2008, Blinken worked for Joe Biden's presidential campaign,[5] and was a member of the Obama–Biden presidential transition team.[31]\n\n\n\n### Obama administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken in the White House Situation Room (back of the room, blue shirt, leaning) during the Osama Bin Laden raid, as seen in the photograph named *Situation Room*\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Blinken was deputy assistant to the president and national security advisor to the Vice President. In this position he helped craft U.S. policy on Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the nuclear program of Iran.[3][4] Blinken was sworn in as deputy national security advisor, succeeding Denis McDonough, on January 20, 2013.[32]\n\n\nOn November 7, 2014, President Obama announced that he would nominate Blinken for the deputy secretary post, replacing the retiring William J. Burns.[33] On December 16, 2014, Blinken was confirmed as Deputy Secretary of State by the Senate by a vote of 55 to 38.[34]\n\n\nOf Obama's 2011 decision to kill Osama bin Laden, Blinken said \"I've never seen a more courageous decision made by a leader.\"[35] A 2013 profile described him as \"one of the government's key players in drafting Syria policy\",[5] for which he served as a public face.[36] Blinken was influential in formulating the Obama administration's response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in the aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution.[37][38]\n\n\nBlinken supported the 2011 military intervention in Libya[36] and the supply of weapons to Syrian rebels.[39] He condemned the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt and expressed support for the democratically elected Turkish government and its institutions, but also criticized the 2016–present purges in Turkey.[40] In April 2015, Blinken voiced support for the Saudi Arabian–led intervention in Yemen.[41] He said that \"as part of that effort, we have expedited weapons deliveries, we have increased our intelligence sharing, and we have established a joint coordination planning cell in the Saudi operation centre.\"[42]\n\n\nBlinken worked with Biden on requests for American money to replenish Israel's arsenal of Iron Dome interceptor missiles during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[43] In May 2015, Blinken criticized the persecution of Muslims in Myanmar and warned Myanmar's leaders about the dangers of anti-Muslim legislation,[44] saying that Rohingya Muslims \"should have a path to citizenship. The uncertainty that comes from not having any status is one of the things that may drive people to leave.\"[45]\n\n\nIn June 2015, Blinken claimed that more than ten thousand ISIL fighters had been killed by American-led airstrikes against the Islamic State since a U.S.-led coalition launched a campaign against it nine months previously.[46]\n\n\n\n\n### Penn Biden Center[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, Blinken served as the managing director of the Penn Biden Center, a University of Pennsylvania think tank.[47] During this time he published several articles on foreign policy and the Trump administration.\n\n\n\n### Private sector[edit]\n\n\n#### WestExec Advisors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Blinken co-founded WestExec Advisors, a political strategy advising firm, with Michèle Flournoy, Sergio Aguirre, and Nitin Chadda.[48][49] WestExec's clients have included Google's Jigsaw, Israeli artificial-intelligence company Windward, surveillance drone manufacturer Shield AI, which signed a $7.2 million contract with the Air Force,[50] and \"*Fortune* 100 types\".[51] According to *Foreign Policy*, the firm's clientele includes \"the defense industry, private equity firms, and hedge funds\".[52] Blinken received almost $1.2 million in compensation from WestExec.[53]\n\n\nIn an interview with *The Intercept*, Flournoy described WestExec's role as facilitating relationships between Silicon Valley firms and the Department of Defense and law enforcement;[54] Flournoy and others compared WestExec to Kissinger Associates.[54][55]\n\n\n\n#### Pine Island Capital Partners[edit]\n\n\nBlinken, as well as other Biden transition team members Michele Flournoy, former Pentagon advisor, and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, are partners of private equity firm Pine Island Capital Partners,[56][57] a strategic partner of WestExec.[58] Pine Island's chairman is John Thain, the final chairman of Merrill Lynch before its sale to Bank of America.[59] Blinken went on leave from Pine Island in August 2020 to join the Biden campaign as a senior foreign policy advisor.[57] He said he would divest himself of his equity stake in Pine Island if confirmed for a position in the Biden administration.[58]\n\n\nDuring the final stretch of Biden's presidential campaign, Pine Island raised $218 million for a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a public offering to invest in \"defense, government service and aerospace industries\" and COVID-19 relief, which the firm's prospectus (initially filed with the U.S. SEC in September and finalized on November 13, 2020) predicted would be profitable as the government looked to private contractors to address the pandemic.[57] Thain said he chose the other partners because of their \"access, network and expertise\".[50]\n\n\nIn a December 2020 *New York Times* article raising questions about potential conflicts of interest between WestExec principals, Pine Island advisors, including Blinken, and service in the Biden administration, critics called for full disclosure of all WestExec/Pine Island financial relationships, divestiture of ownership stakes in companies bidding on government contracts or enjoying existing contracts, and assurances that Blinken and others recuse themselves from decisions that might advantage their previous clients.[50]\n\n\nBlinken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations[60] and was previously a global affairs analyst for CNN.[61][62]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of state[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken being sworn in as Secretary of State at the U.S. State Department on January 26, 2021.\nBlinken was a foreign policy advisor for Biden's 2020 presidential campaign.[63]\nOn November 22, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Biden had selected Blinken as his nominee for secretary of state.[64] These reports were later corroborated by *The New York Times* and other outlets.[30][65][64] On November 24, upon being announced as Biden's choice for secretary of state, Blinken said, \"We can't solve all the world's problems alone [and] we need to be working with other countries.\"[66] He had earlier remarked in a September 2020 interview with the Associated Press that \"democracy is in retreat around the world, and unfortunately it's also in retreat at home because of the president taking a two-by-four to its institutions, its values and its people every day.\"[67]\n\n\nBlinken's confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 19, 2021. His nomination was confirmed by the committee on January 25 with a vote of 15–3.[68] On January 26, Blinken was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 78–22.[1] Blinken took the oath of office of the secretary of state later that day.[69] In doing so, he became the third former deputy secretary of state to serve as the Secretary of State, after Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren Christopher in 1992 and 1993, respectively.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international trips made by Antony Blinken as United States Secretary of State\n\n#### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nOn January 31, 2021, Blinken condemned the 2021 Myanmar coup d'état and expressed grave concerns on the detention of government officials and civil society leaders, calling for their immediate release.[72] He stated that, \"the United States will continue to take firm action against those who perpetrate violence against the people of Burma as they demand the restoration of their democratically elected government.\"[73]\n\n\n\n#### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2021, having spoken to president Ashraf Ghani, Blinken voiced support for Afghan peace negotiations with Taliban Islamist rebels and reiterated the United States' commitment to a peace deal that includes a \"just and durable political settlement and permanent and comprehensive ceasefire.\"[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blinken meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to discuss U.S. troop withdrawal\nBlinken made an unannounced visit to Kabul on April 15 and met with U.S. military and diplomatic personnel following the Biden administration's announcement of the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.[75] He said the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was made to focus resources on China and the COVID-19 pandemic.[76] He faced calls to resign as secretary of state following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.[77][78][79][80]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Blinken rejected comparisons between the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan due to the Taliban offensive, which started in May 2021 after U.S. and coalition military forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan, and the chaotic American departure from Saigon in 1975, saying that \"We went to Afghanistan 20 years ago with one mission, and that mission was to deal with the folks who attacked us on 9/11 and we have succeeded in that mission.\"[81]\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken meeting with Kenyan President William Ruto on September 21, 2022\nIn February 2021, Blinken condemned ethnic cleansing in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia and called for the immediate withdrawal of Eritrean forces and other fighters.[82][83]\n\n\nIn the midst of the Biden administration's continuing review of the normalization agreement between Morocco and Israel enacted during the previous administration, Blinken maintained that the recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which was annexed by Morocco in 1975, will not be reversed imminently. During internal discussions, he supported improving relations between the two countries and expressed urgency in appointing a United Nations envoy to Western Sahara.[84][85]\n\n\nIn March 2023, he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa to normalize relations between the United States and Ethiopia that were strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[86]\n\n\n\n#### South America[edit]\n\n\nBlinken spoke with the interim president of Venezuela, Juan Guaidó, whom the Biden administration will continue to recognize as the country's head of state and not Nicolás Maduro.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Asia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Manila on August 6, 2022\nBlinken made his first international trip with Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to Tokyo and Seoul on March 15, during which he warned China against coercion and aggression.[88][89] He also condemned the Chinese government for committing genocide against ethnic Uyghurs.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Biden administration accused China of a global cyberespionage campaign, which Blinken said posed \"a major threat to our economic and national security\".[91]\n\n\nIn late April 2021, Blinken denounced the sentencing of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists Jimmy Lai, Albert Ho, and Lee Cheuk-yan among others, for their roles in the 2019 Hong Kong protests, calling it a \"politically-motivated\" decision.[92][93]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Blinken stated that \"China is the one country that has the intention as well as the economic, technological, military and diplomatic means to advance a different vision of international order.\"[94] He dismissed China's claims to be neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War and accused China of supporting Russia.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip to Beijing. According to the State Department's readout, Blinken \"emphasized the importance of maintaining open channels of communication across the full range of issues to reduce the risk of miscalculation\" and \"made clear that while we will compete vigorously, the United States will responsibly manage that competition so that the relationship does not veer into conflict.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### G7 meeting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken meets with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Bali, Indonesia, on July 9, 2022\nIn May 2021, Blinken traveled to London and Reykjavík for the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers' meeting and the Arctic Council Ministerial meeting respectively.[97][98] In a meeting with president Volodymyr Zelensky and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in Kyiv, Blinken reaffirmed support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity against \"Russian aggression\".[99] During the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Blinken expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself but warned that evicting Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem is among the actions that could further escalate outbreaks of violence and retaliation.[100][101] He, along with the United Nations Security Council, called for full adherence to the truce and stressed the immediate need for humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians while reiterating the need for a two-state solution.[102] Following the ceasefire and coinciding Blinken's visit to Jerusalem on May 25, the transfer of food and medical supplies furnished by the United Nations and Physicians for Human Rights, aid workers, and journalists were permitted into the Gaza Strip.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken in group meeting with German FM Maas, Turkish FM Çavuşoğlu, British FM Raab, Italian FM Di Maio, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg and U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin, April 2021\nThe decision to waive sanctions against Nord Stream AG and its chief executive Matthias Warnig, subsequent to the completion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, drew congressional criticisms.[104] Blinken defended the action as pragmatic and practical to U.S. interests and remarked that proceeding otherwise would be counterproductive with European relations.[104] In June 2021, Blinken traveled with Biden to attend the 47th G7 summit in Cornwall, the 31st NATO summit in Brussels, and the summit meeting with president Vladimir Putin in Geneva.[105] Blinken and Biden both acknowledged that relations between the U.S. and Russia were at their lowest point, and a more predictable relationship remained a key priority.[106] However, he signaled that further punitive actions would be enforced if the Russian government chose to continue with hostile activities such as interference in the 2020 presidential elections, the SolarWinds cyberattack, or the apparent poisoning and imprisonment of Alexei Navalny.[106] Of the administration's decision to forgo a joint press conference after the summit, Blinken explained that it was \"the most effective way\" and \"not a rare practice\".[107]\n\n\nLater that month, Blinken traveled to Brussels for a NATO Ministerial with European Union counterparts to underscore the Biden administration's determination to strengthen transatlantic alliances.\n\n\nBlinken has been a co-chair of the Trade and Technology Council since its creation in 2021 to encourage trade relations with the European Union.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Russia-Ukraine war[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blinken meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv in 2022. As Secretary of State, Blinken has been deeply involved in the American response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn January 2022, Blinken authorized the supply of weapons to Ukraine to support the Eastern European country in amid border tensions with Russia.[109][110] On January 19, 2022, at a joint press availability with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Blinken said \"One of the principles which you’ve heard us repeat – but it always bears repeating – is nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.[111] February 11, Blinken publicly warned about the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine prior to the end the 2022 Winter Olympics.[112] On February 13, Blinken said the risk of invasion was \"high enough and the threat is imminent enough\" that the evacuation of most staff from the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv was \"the prudent thing to do\".[113] In September 2022, Blinken pledged that the United States would help the Ukrainian military retake Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.[114] He criticized Vladimir Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons, saying that \"Russia has gotten itself into the mess that it's in is because there is no one in the [autocratic] system to effectively tell Putin he's doing the wrong thing.\"[115]\n\n\nRegarding the countries that decided to be neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine, Blinken said that \"It's pretty hard to be neutral when it comes to this aggression. There is a clear aggressor. There is a clear victim.\"[116]\n\n\nSpeaking about the 2022 Russian mobilization, he said that mobilized Russian civilians were being treated as \"cannon fodder that Putin is trying to throw into the war.\"[117] On October 21, 2022, Blinken said the United States saw no willingness on the side of Russia to end its war in Ukraine by diplomatic means, despite American attempts.[118] Blinken questioned China's peace proposal, saying \"the world should not be fooled by any tactical move by Russia, supported by China or any other country, to freeze the war on its own terms.\"[119] In June 2023, he rejected any \"cease-fire that simply freezes current lines in place\".[120] In July 2023, he defended Biden's decision to supply Ukraine with cluster munitions.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Americans detained abroad[edit]\n\n\nBlinken and the Biden administration have been criticized for the handling of Americans who are wrongfully imprisoned abroad. Families of U.S. detainees in the Middle East were upset that they were left off of a call with Secretary Blinken.[122] In July 2022, Blinken had a meeting with Sergey Lavrov to discuss a prisoner swap to secure the release of Paul Whelan (security director) and Brittney Griner.[123] Blinken has met with the Bring Our Families Home campaign, a coalition of families with loved ones detained abroad.[124]\n\n\nBlinken, along with the work of Special Presidential Envoy of Hostage Affairs Roger D. Carstens, has negotiated the release of over a dozen Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage abroad including Trevor Reed, Danny Fenster, Baquer Namazi, the entire Citgo Six, Osman Khan, Matthew John Heath, Mark Frerichs, and Jorge Alberto Fernández.\n\n\n\n## Foreign policy positions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign policy of the Joe Biden administration\n\n![](image)Blinken with Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi, January 18, 2016\nAs foreign policy advisor to then 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, *The New York Times* described Blinken as \"ha[ving] Biden's ear on policy issues\".[125] His foreign policy positions have been described as hawkish.[126] Blinken has asserted that \"[Biden] would not tie military assistance to Israel to things like annexation or other decisions by the Israeli government with which we might disagree\".[127] Blinken praised the Trump administration-brokered normalization agreements between Israel and Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.[128][129] On October 28, 2020, Blinken reaffirmed that a Biden administration will undertake strategic review of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, ensuring that it advances U.S interests and values.[130] In January 2021, Blinken has stated the Biden administration would keep the American embassy to Israel in Jerusalem and would seek a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[131]\nBlinken is in favor of continuing non-nuclear sanctions against Iran and described it as \"a strong hedge against Iranian misbehavior in other areas\".[128] He criticized former president Trump's withdrawal of the U.S. from the international nuclear agreement with Iran and expressed support for a \"longer and stronger\" nuclear deal.[132][133] Blinken did not rule out a military intervention to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.[134][135]\n\n\nBlinken has been critical of the Trump administration in aiding China to advance its own key strategic goals. He stated: \"[Trump] weaken[ed] American alliances, leaving a vacuum in the world for China to fill, abandoning our values and giving China a green light to trample on human rights and democracy from Xinjiang to Hong Kong\".[136] However, he also credited the former president's administration for its aggressive approach and has characterized China as a \"techno-autocracy\" which seeks world dominance.[137][138] He indicated a desire to welcome political refugees from Hong Kong and stated that the Biden administration's commitment to Taiwan's defense would \"absolutely endure\", and that China's use of military force against Taiwan \"would be a grievous mistake on their part\".[138] Blinken has also viewed China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in its northwestern region of Xinjiang.[139] Blinken has characterized former president Trump's Phase One trade deal with China as \"a debacle\".[140] He said it was unrealistic to \"fully decouple\" from China and has expressed support for \"stronger economic ties with Taiwan\".[140][141]\n\n\nBlinken has indicated American interest in robust ties between itself, Greece, Israel, and Cyprus regarding the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act and acknowledged the threats posed by an expansionist Turkey, which is \"not acting like an ally\".[142] He opposed Turkish president Recep Erdogan's call for \"a two-state solution in Cyprus\", saying the Biden administration is committed to the reunification of Cyprus.[40][143] Blinken has also suggested that he would consider sanctioning the Erdogan administration.[144] Blinken reaffirmed his support of keeping NATO's door open for Georgia, a country in the Caucasus, and raised the argument that NATO member countries have been more effectively shielded from \"Russian aggression\".[145]\n\n\nBlinken expressed his support of extending the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia to limit the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads.[30][146] Blinken said the Biden administration will \"review\" security assistance to Azerbaijan due to the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh and voiced his support for \"the provision to Armenia of security assistance\".[147]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blinken with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 16, 2023\nBlinken is opposed to the United Kingdom's separation from the European Union and has referred to it as a \"total mess\" with consequences adverse to U.S. interest.[148][149] Blinken expressed concern over perceived human rights violations in Egypt under the presidency of Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.[150] He condemned the arrest of three employees for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights organization, saying that \"meeting with foreign diplomats is not a crime. Nor is peacefully advocating for human rights.\"[151] Referring to the re-instated Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, declared by the Taliban following their 2021 capture of Kabul, Blinken has stated that the United States will not recognize any government that harbors terrorist groups or that does not uphold basic human rights.[152]\n\n\nDuring a visit to Tel Aviv, following the Hamas attack on Israel, Blinken promised to help defend Israel \"as long as America exists.\" Blinken said that \"Israel has the right, indeed the obligation, to defend itself and to ensure that this never happens again.\"[153] He rejected calls for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBlinken is Jewish.[155] In 2002, Blinken and Evan Ryan were married in an interfaith ceremony officiated by a rabbi and a priest at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, D.C.[20][5] They have two children.[156] Blinken is fluent in French.[157] He plays the guitar and has three songs available on Spotify by the alias Ablinken[158] (pronounced \"Abe Lincoln\").[159] Blinken gave a cover performance of \"Hoochie Coochie Man\" by Muddy Waters in September 2023 to launch the Global Music Diplomacy Initiative.[160]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Blinken, Antony J.

She previously served as the 15th chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018. She is the first person to hold those positions having also led the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the first woman to hold either post.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Yellen graduated from Brown University in 1967 and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in 1971. She taught as an assistant professor at Harvard University from 1971 to 1976, was a staff economist for the Federal Reserve Board from 1977 to 1978, and was a faculty member at the London School of Economics from 1978 to 1980. Yellen is professor emeritus at the Haas School of Business and the University of California, Berkeley, where she has been a faculty member since 1980 and became the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics.\n\n\nYellen served as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 1994 to 1997 and was nominated to the position by President Bill Clinton, who then named her chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999. She subsequently returned to academia before being appointed president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 2004 until 2010. Afterward, President Barack Obama chose her to replace Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve from 2010 to 2014 before nominating her to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve three years later. She was succeeded by Jerome Powell after President Donald Trump declined to renominate her for a second term. Following her resignation from the Federal Reserve, Yellen joined the Brookings Institution as a distinguished fellow in residence from 2018 until 2020, when she again went into public service.[2]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2020, then-President-elect Joe Biden nominated Yellen to serve as secretary of the treasury; she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 25, 2021, and took office the next day.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nYellen was born on August 13, 1946,[4] to a family of Polish Jewish[5] ancestry in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, neighborhood of New York City, and grew up there.[6] Her mother was Anna Ruth (née Blumenthal; 1907–1986), an elementary school teacher who gave up her teaching job to become a stay-at-home mother. Her father was Julius Yellen (1906–1975), a family physician who worked from the ground floor of their house. Janet has an older brother, John (born 1942), who is a program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation.[7][8]\n\n\nIn a speech at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Yellen said that her father's family immigrated to the United States from Sokołów Podlaski, a small town about 50 miles outside of Warsaw. She shared that nearly the entirety of its Jewish population, including many of her relatives, was deported or murdered during the Holocaust.[9]\n\n\nYellen attended the local Fort Hamilton High School, where she was an honor society member and participated in the booster club, the psychology club, and the history club.[8] She also served as editor-in-chief of *The Pilot*, the school newspaper, which continued its 13-year streak as the first-place winner of the prestigious Columbia Scholastic Press Association contest under her leadership.[10] She earned a National Merit commendation letter and was admitted to a selective science honors program at Columbia University to voluntarily study mathematics on Saturday mornings. Yellen was one of 30 students to win state Regents scholarships for college and one of a select few to win the mayor's citation for a scholarship.[10] She graduated in 1963 as the valedictorian of her class. In line with school tradition, for the editor to interview the valedictorian, she interviewed herself in the third person.[11][8][10]\n\n\nYellen enrolled at Pembroke College in Brown University, initially intending to study philosophy. During her freshman year, she switched her planned major to economics and was particularly influenced by professors George Herbert Borts and Herschel Grossman.[12] In the spring of 1964, she also joined the business staff of *The Brown Daily Herald*, but soon afterward she left the paper to focus on her academic studies.[13] Yellen graduated *summa cum laude* and Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's in economics from Brown University in 1967,[14] and earned her master's and PhD in economics from Yale University in 1971.[15] Her dissertation was titled *Employment, Output and Capital Accumulation in an Open Economy: A Disequilibrium Approach* under the supervision of James Tobin,[16] a noted economist who would later receive the Nobel Memorial Prize.[17] As a teaching assistant, Yellen was so meticulous in her note-taking during Tobin's macroeconomics class that her notes became the unofficial textbook and were referred to as \"Yellen Notes\" while being circulated among generations of graduate students.[17] Her former professor and Nobel Prize in Economics laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, has called her one of his brightest and most memorable students.[18] She later described Yale professors Tobin and William Brainard as \"lifelong mentors\" who laid the intellectual groundwork for her economic views.[19] Yellen was the only woman among the two dozen economists who earned their doctorates from Yale in 1971.[18]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter receiving her Ph.D., Yellen obtained the position of assistant professor of economics at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976.[20] At that time, she was one of only two female faculty members in Harvard's economics department; the other woman was Rachel McCulloch. The pair struck up a close friendship and went on to write several academic papers together.[18] In 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors after failing to win tenure at Harvard; she was recruited as a staff economist for the Board of Governors by Edwin M. Truman, who had known her from Yale. Truman was a junior professor when he heard Yellen's oral exam and was then about to take over the Fed's Division of International Finance. She was assigned to research international monetary reform.[21]\n\n\nWhile at the Fed, she met her husband, economist George Akerlof, in the bank's cafeteria; they married in 1978, less than a year later.[21] By the time of their marriage, Akerlof had already accepted a teaching position at the London School of Economics (LSE). Yellen left her post at the Fed to accompany him and was given a tenure-track lectureship by LSE. The couple stayed in the United Kingdom for two years before returning to the United States, in part due to identity issues because they felt American, not English.[22]\n\n\nIn 1980, Yellen joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, where she taught at the Haas School of Business to conduct macroeconomics research and teach undergraduate and MBA students for more than two decades. She earned the Haas School's outstanding teaching award twice, in 1985 and 1988.[23] Prof. Yellen became just the second woman at Berkeley-Haas to earn tenure in 1982, as well as the title of full professor in 1985.[23] She was named the Bernard T. Rocca, Jr. Professor of International Business and Trade in 1992.[24][25]\n\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, Yellen took a leave of absence from Berkeley to go into public service. After returning to academia, she resumed her teaching assignment at Haas and received a joint appointment with Berkeley's Department of Economics.[26] She was appointed the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics in 1999[24] and remained an active faculty member until she was appointed president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004.[27] Yellen was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus at UC Berkeley in 2006.[25]\n\n\nThroughout her career, Yellen served as an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, and the National Science Foundation's Panel in Economics. She was also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1999 to 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n### Contributions to economics[edit]\n\n\nYellen's academic career has largely focused on the analysis of the mechanisms of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade. She has written a few widely cited papers, often collaborating on research with her husband, Professor George Akerlof.[28][29]\n\n\n\n#### Efficiency wage models[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, Yellen and Akerlof have addressed what's known in the economics literature as \"efficiency wage theory\" – the idea that paying people more than the market wage does increase their productivity. Their 1990 paper, entitled \"The Fair-Wage Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment\", coined \"the fair wage effort hypothesis\" and was considered by economists to be a significant contribution to the topic: \"A precursor to the efficiency wage literature...it had an influence, although the work on efficiency wage theory has had a bigger influence.\"[30] Akerlof and Yellen introduced the gift-exchange game, which argues that workers who are paid less than what they consider to be a fair wage will purposefully work less hard to exact revenge on their employer.[30][28]\n\n\n\n#### Reproductive technology shock[edit]\n\n\nAnother work, \"An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States\", co-written with Akerlof and Michael Katz and published in 1996, aims to explain why out-of-wedlock births have grown considerably in previous decades in the United States. A research study led to a theory called \"reproductive technology shock\", arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s, amidst the sexual revolution, eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy, and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood.[31] At the same time, this transformation encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations.[32]\n\n\n\n## Federal Reserve (1994–1997)[edit]\n\n\nOn April 22, 1994, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Yellen as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, alongside Alan Blinder, who has been designated as vice chairman. They were the first Democratic appointees to the Board since 1980.[33][34] In an issued statement, the president praised her as \"one of the most prominent economists of her generation on the intersection of macroeconomics and labor markets.\"[35] President Clinton played an indirect role in the selection process, delegating most of the responsibility to NEC Director Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and CEA Chair Laura Tyson, who was a colleague of Yellen's at Berkeley. The group settled on her candidacy after an exhaustive search that at one point included nearly 50 names.[33] In July 1994, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said that Fed policies should keep the economy growing as much as possible without accelerating inflation but avoid taking a clear position on the prospect of further increases in interest rates.[36] The Senate panel approved her nomination without much Republican opposition, by a vote of 18 to 1; the only dissenting vote came from Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), who said that her concerns should be limited to inflation.[37] The nomination was confirmed in the full United States Senate by a vote of 94–6.[38] On August 12, 1994, Yellen was appointed to a full 14-year term and assumed the seat vacated by Republican Wayne Angell.[37] She was installed as the fourth female governor, joining Susan M. Phillips, which marks the first time that two women have sat on the Federal Reserve Board simultaneously.[39]\n\n\nIn July 1996, the Federal Reserve resisted pressure to raise interest rates as unemployment dropped. Yellen marshaled academic research to dissuade Chairman Alan Greenspan from committing the Fed to a zero inflation policy and demonstrate that the central bank should seek to moderate inflation rather than eliminate it. According to the study, a low inflation rate of around 2 percent provided a better foundation for reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth than the goal of zero.[40]\n\n\nUpon her confirmation as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, she resigned as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 17, 1997.\n\n\n\n## Council of Economic Advisers (1997–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official photo as CEA chair, c. 1990s\nOn December 20, 1996, Yellen joined the Clinton administration as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), replacing Joseph Stiglitz in office.[41] She was reluctant to leave the Federal Reserve, but White House officials talked her into a job, passing over others with greater marquee value because, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, \"We wanted someone who could bring a rigorous analytic approach to the issues and who could work well with others.\"[42] Yellen was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1997,[43] thereby becoming the second woman to serve as chief economic advisor to the president after Laura Tyson.[44][42] While serving within the Administration, she concurrently chaired the OECD Economic Policy Committee from 1997 to 1999.[25]\n\n\nDuring her time with the Council of Economic Advisers, Yellen oversaw a June 1998 report, \"Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap\",[45] which focused on the gender pay divide. Within this study, the Council analyzed data from 1969 to 1996 to determine the reasons why women earn substantially less than men. By observing trends attributable to issues such as occupation and industry, as well as familial status, it was determined that while the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a step forward, there was no explanation for a 25-percent difference between average pay for women and men – an improvement from the 40-percent gap two decades earlier. It was concluded that this gap had no correlation with differences in productivity and, as such, was the result of discrimination within the workforce.[18]\n\n\nIn June 1999, Yellen announced that she was stepping down from the CEA for personal reasons and would return to teaching at UC Berkeley.[46] It was reported that President Clinton asked her to take over from Alice Rivlin, the central bank's vice chairwoman – an offer she turned down.[47]\n\n\n\n## Return to the Federal Reserve (2004–2018)[edit]\n\n\n### Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco[edit]\n\n\nOn April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T. Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14.[48] She was the first woman to hold this position.[18] While serving as Federal Reserve District president, she sat on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and was a voting member once every three years on a rotating basis, with her first being in 2006.[48] During her time at the San Francisco Fed, the largest of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks in terms of population and economic output, Yellen publicly downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of the boom in housing prices; at FOMC meetings, on the contrary, she sounded the alarm on banks' heavy concentration in risky construction and home-development loans.[49] On the other hand, she did not lead the San Francisco Fed to \"move to check [the] increasingly indiscriminate lending\" of Countrywide Financial, the United States' largest lender.[50][51]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2009, Yellen said that the Federal Reserve should consider raising interest rates earlier to prevent another housing bubble. She argued that higher short-term interest rates probably went against the expansion of a bubble in certain circumstances, like restraining the demand for housing and high-risk mortgages.[52]\n\n\nIn July 2009, Yellen was mentioned as a potential successor to Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term was set to expire before he was re-nominated for a second four-year term.[53] She eventually emerged as the leading contender for vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board in March 2010,[54] and following her Senate confirmation, she resigned from the San Francisco Fed in October of that year.[55]\n\n\n\n### Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen takes the oath of office administered by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke in the Eccles Building, October 4, 2010\nOn April 28, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Yellen to succeed Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve.[56] In July 2010, the Senate Banking Committee voted 17–6 to confirm her, though the top Republican on the panel, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted no, saying \"President Yellen presided over a regional housing bubble and failed to restrain the excesses.\"[57]\n\n\nAround the same time, on the heels of related testimony by Fed chairman Bernanke, FOMC voting member James B. Bullard of the St. Louis Fed stated that the U.S. economy was at risk of becoming \"enmeshed in a Japanese-style deflationary outcome within the next several years.\"[58] That statement was interpreted as a possible shift within the FOMC balance between inflation hawks and doves. Yellen's pending confirmation, along with those of Peter Diamond and Sarah Bloom Raskin to fill vacancies, was seen as possibly furthering such a shift in the FOMC. All three nominations were seen as \"on track to be confirmed by the Senate.\"[58]\n\n\nOn September 29, 2010, Yellen, along with Raskin,[59] was confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote to be both a member of the board of governors[60] and vice chairman of the Federal Reserve System.[61] On October 4, the pair were sworn in as Fed governors, while Yellen also took the oath of office as vice chair of the board for a four-year term.[55] Simultaneously, she began a 14-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, filling a vacant seat last held by Mark W. Olson.[55] Yellen was just the second woman to hold the Federal Reserve's No. 2 post, after Alice Rivlin.[62]\n\n\nIn contrast to her predecessors, Yellen acted more independently within the institution in her role as vice chair.[63] She has been urging Bernanke and the other FOMC members to follow her preferred route for monetary policy, arguing for more forceful actions to inject money into the economy to reduce unemployment.[64] Yellen played a leading role in moving the Federal Reserve to announce its inflation target of two percent a year after her long campaign with Chairman Bernanke; she was an early supporter of inflation targeting, facing opposition from Chairman Greenspan during her first stint at the Fed in the 1990s.[65][63]\n\n\nYellen was widely considered the front-runner to succeed Bernanke as the Federal Reserve's chair when his second term ceased.[65][66][67] Lawrence Summers, a former President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and former director of President Obama's National Economic Council, was the other leading contender in the highly publicized race; media outlets reported that the president was leaning toward selecting the latter candidate.[68] However, throughout the race, Summers drew criticism from both sides of the aisle for his role in deregulating parts of the banking sector while he served in the Clinton administration. He sparked further controversy for remarks on women's aptitude in math and science, which he made in 2005 while serving as Harvard University's president.[18] In July 2013, Yellen was pushed to be named the first chairwoman of the central bank in a letter that was circulated among the Senate Democrats and had been signed by almost a third of the 54 caucus senators, who primarily represent the liberal wing of the party.[69] In addition, more than 500 professional economists from around 200 colleges and universities across the United States signed an open letter in support of her candidacy for Fed chair and sent it to the White House.[70] After weeks of opposition to his potential nomination, Summers withdrew his name from consideration for the position in September.[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Chair of the Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait as Federal Reserve chair, 2015\n![](image)From left to right: Janet Yellen, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Paul Volcker, May 1, 2014\n![](image)Yellen in conversation with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, July 2, 2014\nOn October 9, 2013, Yellen was officially nominated to replace Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve,[73][74] the first vice chair ever to be elevated to that post.[75] While announcing his decision, President Obama called her \"one of the nation's foremost economists and policymakers\" and said that \"America's workers and their families will have a champion in Janet Yellen.\"[76] During the nomination hearings held in November, Yellen defended the more than $3 trillion in stimulus funds that the central bank had been injecting into the U.S. economy.[77] She also said that it is important for the Fed to try to detect asset bubbles and that if she saw one, she would work to address it.[78]\n\n\nOn December 20, 2013, the U.S. Senate voted 59–34 for cloture on Yellen's nomination.[79] On January 6, 2014, she was confirmed as chair of the Federal Reserve by a vote of 56–26,[80] the narrowest margin ever for the position.[81] Yellen was a trailblazer as the first woman to head the U.S. central bank, or any major central bank, and the first Democrat to do so since Paul Volcker assumed that position in 1979 via President Jimmy Carter.[1] She was sworn into office on February 3, 2014,[82] and was previously elected as FOMC chair on January 30.[83] According to a Fed representative, on Yellen's request, her title would be altered to \"chair\" rather than \"chairman\" or \"chairwoman\", as she prefers a gender-neutral manner.[62][18] Only one woman had ever led the central bank of a G8 country before Yellen – Russia's Elvira Nabiullina.[84]\n\n\nIn July 2014, at her first semi-annual congressional testimony on U S. monetary policy, Yellen said, \"while real estate, equities, and corporate bond prices have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased they were generally in line with historical norms.\" She also acknowledged some concerns about the valuations of lower-rated corporate debt and affirmed that she and other Fed officials were monitoring trends but did not believe that a so-called \"everything bubble\" was forming.[85]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2015, the Federal Reserve under Yellen increased its key interest rate for the first time since 2006.[86] That move was largely expected because extraordinarily low rates for an extremely long time may contribute to financial instability and pose a threat to the economy, and was considered a departure from the previous controversial Fed policy, commonly known as the \"Greenspan put\".[87][88] During her tenure, the Fed has gradually raised rates four additional times, leaving its key rate in a still-low range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent – well below historical standards.[89]\n\n\nFollowing the 2016 presidential election, Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd–Frank Act in her Joint Economic Committee testimony, standing in opposition to incoming President Donald Trump's plans to review the landmark legislation. She argued that it would be inappropriate to weaken or repeal the law designed to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis.[90] Yellen provided further support for financial regulations enacted in the wake of the Great Recession in a speech to the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on August 25, 2017. In her remarks about the aftermath of the crisis, she said, \"The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.\" Yellen warned that any adjustment to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience.[91]\n\n\nIn November 2017, as Yellen's tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve was coming to an end, Trump considered nominating her for another term, but on the advice of his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, he picked a Republican Fed governor, Jerome Powell, instead.[92] Yellen made her resignation from the Federal Reserve Board at the conclusion of her chairmanship known after Trump's choice, despite still having her assignment as Fed governor until 2024.[93] She served a single term and became just the second Federal Reserve chair eligible for reappointment not renominated by a successor presidential administration, the first being Arthur F. Burns almost 40 years prior.[94] That unusual departure makes her the briefest-serving central bank chief since G. William Miller, who held that office for over a year, from 1978 to 1979.[95]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2018, Yellen enforced enormous sanctions on Wells Fargo, which was the third-largest U.S. bank at the time, with a consent order restricting the firm's expansion unless it resolved its internal issues.[96][97] That move came in response to a string of \"widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns\" at the company, particularly a fake account scandal,[98] and marked the first time the Fed has imposed a cap on the entire assets of a financial institution.[97]\n\n\nRegarding labor markets, Yellen has been dubbed one of the Federal Reserve System's most successful chairpersons. During her term, the unemployment rate dropped from 6.7 percent to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years.[99][100][89] For the first time since central bank creation, the economy added jobs throughout every month of any Fed chair's tenure.[100] Yellen completed her time at the Fed with the lowest final unemployment rate of any Fed chair since William McChesney Martin in 1970.[101] Under her leadership, the U.S. unemployment rate fell more than during any other chair's term in the post-World War II era, declining 2.6 percentage points.[101] On the other hand, inflation remained below the Fed's annual two percent target, which led to the suggestion that the central bank could have done even more to bolster the economy without the risk of price increases.[102]\n\n\nYellen became the first person in U.S. central bank history to have served as a Federal Reserve chair (2014–2018), vice chair (2010–2014), district president (FRB of San Francisco, 2004–2010), Fed governor (1994–1997 and 2010–2018), and staff economist (1977–1978).[103]\n\n\n\n## After the Federal Reserve (2018–2020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen delivers her farewell speech to Federal Reserve staff, February 1, 2018\nOn February 2, 2018, the Brookings Institution announced that Yellen would join the think tank as a distinguished fellow in residence with the Economic Studies program, effective February 5, 2018.[104] She's been affiliated with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings.[105] On July 31, 2018, the Hutchins Center announced Yellen, James H. Stock, and Louise Sheiner as co-chairs of the newly launched Productivity Measurement Initiative, aimed at improving the quality of economic statistics.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Yellen left her position at Brookings after being selected as a nominee to serve as Treasury secretary.[2] Within the think tank, she has been providing expertise and commentary on a range of economic issues, offering her perspective and analysis at Brookings panels, congressional testimony, lectures across the United States and abroad, and regularly serving as a commentator in the media.[2]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Yellen stated that she did not expect another financial crisis \"in our lifetime\" because she thought banks were \"much stronger\" as a result of Federal Reserve oversight.[107] In a December 10, 2018 conversation with Paul Krugman at the City University of New York, she warned of the possibility of another financial crisis by citing \"gigantic holes in the system\" after she departs from the Federal Reserve.[108]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2019, in an interview with *Marketplace*, when asked if she believed Trump has \"a grasp of macroeconomic policy,\" Yellen replied, \"No, I do not.\"[109] She expressed her doubts about the president's ability to articulate the Federal Reserve's explicit goals of \"maximum employment and price stability\" and emphasized his assertions that the Federal Reserve's goals include trade, which she explains are objectively false. She raised further concern over Trump's regard for the independence of the central bank and voiced support for her successor, Jerome Powell.[109] This interview marked a notable change in tone for Yellen, who traditionally handled her differences with the president in a neutral manner.[110]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2020, at the hearing of the House Select Oversight Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which was set up by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, former Federal Reserve chairs Bernanke and Yellen testified about the economic policy response to the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic. They urged lawmakers to act aggressively with fiscal stimulus in three areas: extending the supplementary unemployment payments; providing additional financial assistance to hard-hit states and local governments; and investing in the medical response to the pandemic.[111] She also expressed this commitment to stimulus in an op-ed for *The New York Times* with Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.[112]\n\n\nIn August 2020, it was reported that Yellen was among a handful of economists who briefed former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, and his chosen running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, on economic issues.[113] The meeting was one of the first times the Biden campaign announced its economic expert, whom few at the time predicted would take a presidential cabinet post.[114]\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Yellen received over $7 million in speaking fees from financial companies such as Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and the hedge fund Citadel after leaving the Federal Reserve.[115][116][117] With her return to government, she pledged to get official permission from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to participate in substantive issues involving such firms to avoid any conflict of interest.[118][117]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of the Treasury (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris receive an economic briefing from Treasury Secretary Yellen in the Oval Office, January 29, 2021\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a possible secretary of the treasury in the incoming Biden administration.[119][120] She edged out other top contenders to obtain the position, including Fed Board Gov. Lael Brainard and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman.[114][121]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2020, then-President-elect Biden announced he would nominate Yellen as Treasury Secretary in his cabinet.[122][123] In his remarks on the announcement, Biden lauded her as \"one of the most important economic thinkers of our time\" who \"spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work.\"[124] Despite being a highly respected figure across the political spectrum and expected to win confirmation easily, she was considered an unusual pick for the position because of her lack of experience in political maneuvering. Unlike her predecessors, she is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to achieving the goals of Biden's economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress.[125][126][127] All living former U.S. treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed Yellen for the position in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm her.[128]\n\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved Yellen's candidacy by a 26–0 vote on January 22, 2021.[129] The full U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination with a vote of 84–15 (with one abstention, Marco Rubio, R-FL)[130] on January 25.[131] With her oath of office administered by Vice President Harris the next day,[132] Yellen became the first female Secretary of the Treasury and the first person in American history to lead the three most powerful economic bodies in the federal government of the United States: the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.[3][131]\n\n\nOnly two other women within the G7 nations – France's Christine Lagarde and Canada's Chrystia Freeland – have held positions analogous to Yellen's as Treasury Secretary.[133]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### Proposed international tax reform[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen meeting with German finance minister Olaf Scholz, July 2, 2021\nIn April 2021, Yellen proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance.[134] In an accompanying written piece for *The Wall Street Journal*, she outlined the enormous benefits of the discussed tax system for the US economy as well as the global economy.[135] On June 5, 2021, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to reinstate a minimum worldwide corporate tax rate of at least 15% as part of a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system, while \nFrance's Bruno Le Maire called it \"a starting point\" that could be increased in the future.[136] A few days later, Treasury Secretary Yellen co-wrote an op-ed for *The Washington Post* with four of her international counterparts, describing the new agreement as \"an historic opportunity to end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation, restoring government resources at a time when they are most needed.\"[137] The next month, financial leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\"[138]\n\n\nIn October 2021, more than 130 countries, accounting for more than 90% of global GDP, including several low-tax jurisdictions that had previously fought the pact, enforced through the OECD a landmark agreement to establish a global minimum tax rate of 15% for businesses worldwide. The projected gain from the deal, which was anticipated to take effect in 2023, may result in an increase of $150 billion in annual tax revenues. It is worth noting, however, that the treaty's implementation path remains uncertain because its ratification requires a two-thirds majority in the evenly divided U.S. Senate as well as passing domestic legislation in each of the signed countries.[139]\n\n\n\n#### Debt ceiling crisis[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2021, Yellen sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders in which she urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the nation's debt limit as soon as possible before it hit its statutory limit in August and the government would be unable to pay its bills. She warned Congress that failing to meet those financial obligations would cause \"irreparable harm\" to the U.S. economy and that the Treasury Department would take \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the United States from suffering a government shutdown or even a debt default.[140]\n\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Yellen, in an op-ed for *The Wall Street Journal*, again called for an increase in the debt ceiling; otherwise, sometime in October, the Treasury expected to exhaust its cash reserves, which would trigger a financial crisis.[141] After lawmakers adopted a short-term debt ceiling bill to raise the United States' borrowing limit through early December, she said that a longer-term measure should be provided to ensure certainty in government's solvency.[142] In November, Yellen expressed her willingness to consider solutions to the debt crisis without GOP support if necessary, using a budget reconciliation as a viable alternative.[143] She also supported the idea for Democrats to raise the debt limit high enough that it would not be reached until after the 2024 general elections while the party holds a majority in both houses of Congress, therefore preventing the issue from being weaponized for political reasons.[144]\n\n\nIn December 2021, President Biden signed a debt ceiling increase into law, preventing a U.S. default, a day after the Treasury's previously estimated deadline to address the issue. Congressional legislation designated to cover the government's financial commitments beyond the 2022 midterm elections was passed in a nearly party-line vote.[145]\n\n\nIn January 2023, after Republicans took control over the House, Yellen informed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and new congressional leadership that the U.S. expected to hit the debt ceiling on January 19 and that the Treasury yet again would be forced to use \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent default, and it could last until June of that year. She repeated her call to \"act in a timely manner to increase or suspend the debt limit.\"[146] Yellen rejected the GOP plan on government payments prioritization once \"extraordinary measures\" are exhausted, insisting that her department doesn't have the systems to do so and that proposal effectively means a default.[147]\n\n\nOn June 3, 2023, President Biden signed into law bipartisan congressional legislation that suspended the public debt limit throughout his first term in office, therefore ending the ongoing debt-ceiling crisis. It came as a compromise on fiscal spending between the White House and House Republicans two days before the United States was estimated to reach the debt ceiling and subsequently could no longer meet its own financial obligations.[148]\n\n\n\n#### Sanctions against Russia and oil price cap[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Yellen and senior Treasury personnel were tasked with crafting a sanctions strategy that would maximize the costs inflicted on Russia's economy while limiting, if possible, \nthe expected negative impact on the United States and its allies if a potential aggression began.[149] The Treasury Department worked closely across government agencies and with US allies abroad to impose unprecedented international sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[149]\n\n\nYellen was a key proponent of a price cap on Russian oil, a plan designed to deprive the Kremlin of funding for Russia's war in Ukraine while reducing an inflation surge by preserving the global oil supply.[150] On December 2, 2022, following months of lobbying and negotiations by the United States, the emerging alliance of the G7 nations, the European Union, and Australia agreed to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel as an upper limit, with regular reviews to check that the ceiling stays at least 5 percent below average market prices.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Digital Assets Regulation[edit]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2022, at American University's Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation, Yellen addressed for the first time the growing impact of digital assets on the American economy. Yellen outlined policy objectives and lessons that apply to the navigation of emerging technologies, which include \"first, the U.S. financial system benefits from responsible innovation; second, it's often society's vulnerable who suffer most in an economic crisis when regulation is not moving at the same pace as innovation; third, regulation should focus on activities and risk, not technology; fourth, sovereign money is the core of a functioning financial system; and fifth, it'll take thoughtful public and private dialogue between various groups to move forward.\"[152]\n\n\nYellen also announced possible plans for a government version of a stablecoin; the administration is studying the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital dollar while taking into consideration the impact of a CBDC on monetary policy, national security, and international trade, as well as its utility for consumers. Solving such problems is an \"engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months,\" she said.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Friendshoring of supply chains[edit]\n\n\nIn a speech delivered at the Atlantic Council on April 13, 2022, Yellen advised against the supply chain risks posed by reliance on commodities from countries that aligned with authoritarian regimes like Russia or China and favored friendshoring strategy, an approach that limits supply chain networks to allies and partner countries. She said that any moves from the other nations to undermine collective international effort to make Russia accountable for its aggression would draw the ire of the U.S. and its allies.[154] Yellen also called for the modernization of international financial institutions so that they could meet the world's 21st-century challenges, invoking precedent of the Bretton Woods Conference, which was held during the Second World War to discuss post-war economic order.[155]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Yellen wrote an essay for *Project Syndicate* in which she singled out the key risks for the U.S. economy that may be mitigated with the implementation of friendshoring policies. Those risks include: \"first, over-concentration of critical goods in any particular market may result in vulnerability in supply chains that hurt workers and customers; second, the need to protect from geopolitical and security risks emanating from hostile states; and third, the need to shift away from supply chains that relied on violations of core human rights, such as the use of forced labour in producing goods for import.\"[156]\n\n\n\n#### Comments on *Roe v. Wade* overturning[edit]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2022, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Yellen made comments on the economic consequences of *Roe v. Wade* overturning after a leaked draft majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* showed the Supreme Court was poised to overrule its previous decisions that legalized abortion in the United States. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked what reversing the landmark ruling would mean economically for the United States; Yellen responded, \"I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.\" She added that keeping women from accessing abortions \"increases their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance.\" Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) disagreed with her assertion and said, \"I think finding a way to have a debate around abortion in a meeting for the economic stability of our country is harsh.\" She replied, \"This is not harsh. This is the truth.\"[157]\n\n\nFollowing that heated exchange, Senator Scott penned an op-ed for *The Washington Post* in which he called Yellen's claim \"simply false\" and compared her arguments to those of Margaret Sanger in support of eugenics.[158] A number of prominent conservative media outlets and public figures alike similarly interpreted her comments on women's reproductive rights, responding with sharp criticism.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Internal Revenue Service reforms[edit]\n\n\nAfter the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, Yellen directed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 billion in additional funding over a decade to clear backlogs, improve taxpayer services, update technology, and hire thousands of new employees.[160]\n\n\nIn June 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was passed to reach a bipartisan agreement on debt ceiling, reallocated more than a quarter of the funding previously approved for IRS modernization to other budgetary areas. Despite that, Yellen assured that the agency still possesses the resources it needs in the near term to enhance service and ramp up enforcement. Furthermore, she said that the Treasury Department would continue to advocate for additional funds to make service improvements and help ensure that high-end taxpayers don't avoid paying their fair share.[161]\n\n\n\n#### Visit to Ukraine[edit]\n\n\nOn February 27, 2023, Yellen made a surprise visit to Kyiv, in which she reaffirmed ongoing U.S. economic support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's invasion, including nearly $50 billion in security, financial, and humanitarian aid the federal government has provided over the past year as Ukraine's largest bilateral donor. She met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to discuss the rollout of about $1.25 billion in budget relief, the first of a $10 billion package of civilian assistance for things like schools, hospitals, and emergency services, among others.[162]\n\n\nCoinciding with her visit, Yellen wrote an op-ed for *The New York Times* in which she highlighted the importance of America's support and repeated President Biden's message that Washington will stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes. She said, \"We cannot allow Ukraine to lose the war for economic reasons when it has shown an ability to succeed on the battlefield.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Banking crisis[edit]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2023, amidst the banking crisis, Yellen made an appearance on CBS' *Face the Nation* and affirmed that financial regulators closely monitored the state of the banking system to make sure it remained safe and well-capitalized. Addressing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, she said she had been working with bank regulators to \"design appropriate policies\" to tackle the issue, though declining to provide further details. She stressed that the possibility of a bailout was off the table.[164] Despite her statement, on the same day, Yellen approved actions enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors by announcing a systemic risk exception, with similar provisions being made for Signature Bank, another failed lender.[165] These extraordinary measures were taken to ensure confidence in the U.S. banking system and prevent spreading of a bank run.[166]\n\n\nOn March 21, Yellen delivered a speech to an American Bankers Association (ABA) summit in which she defended the forceful actions taken by regulators to avert a sweeping banking crisis and pledged resolute Biden administration support for lenders in need, regardless of their respective sizes. She said, \"Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system,\" and it was \"not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks.\" Yellen went on to assure that \"similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion.\"[167]\n\n\nNevertheless, Yellen stated in her testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government the following day that the FDIC was not considering providing \"blanket insurance or guarantees of deposits.\" She said uninsured bank deposits beyond the law-established $250,000 limit could be protected only if a failed bank was deemed to pose a systemic risk to the financial system, and that determination would occur only on a case-by-case basis by the regulators.[168]\n\n\nOn April 21, Yellen announced a proposal by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for a new procedure to designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision. It marked an effective reversal of previous guidance, which was issued in 2019 under the Trump administration and, according to Yellen, \"created inappropriate hurdles as part of the designation process.\" She said such a designation process \"could take six years to complete, which could prevent the council from acting to address an emerging risk to financial stability before it's too late.\" The revised guidance relied on a quantitative and qualitative analysis under which the council determined whether \"material financial distress at the company or the company's activities could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability\" and allowed for ample engagement between regulators and the company under review.[169]\n\n\nOn May 18, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) convened a meeting of more than two dozen bank CEOs to discuss the current state of the economy. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNN Business reported on Yellen's remarks that more bank mergers may be necessary to overcome the sector's crisis.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Economic approach to China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen meet Premier Li Qiang\nIn a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023, Yellen laid out three principal objectives of the Biden administration's economic approach toward China. Those principles are: first, the paramount importance of securing American national security interests as well as protecting human rights; second, seeking healthy and fair economic competition with China based on international rules; and third, aiming to engage on major global challenges like easing the debt burden of the developing world and climate change.[171] Though she emphasized that national security would always take priority if it collided with economics, her address ought to be interpreted as an olive branch to Beijing instead of the confrontation that has for a long time prevailed in relations between the two nations. Yellen's speech attempted to revive dialogue, at least on economic matters, as she made clear her desire to visit China as soon as possible to get the countries' previously pragmatic approach to each other back on track. However, its ultimate success is not at all obvious.[172]\n\n\nBetween 6–9 July, Yellen visited China, the first trip to the country by a U.S. Treasury secretary in four years and her first since taking office. She began her visit by holding informal talks with the country's former vice premier Liu He, and People’s Bank of China (PBC) governor Yi Gang about the state of their domestic economies, as well as the global outlook, in a bid to reopen communication lines and find areas of common economic ground between the two nations.[173] Yellen then met with China's newly appointed economic team, including Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, finance minister Liu Kun, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) central bank chief Pan Gongsheng. During those bilateral meetings, she reaffirmed that the US national security restrictions on Chinese investment were intended to be narrowly focused and not have broad effects on the country's economy.[174] Yellen also expressed concerns about Chinese economic policies and went on to criticize the country's authorities for their treatment of foreign, particularly American, companies; she stated, \"We seek healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but that, with a fair set of rules, can benefit both countries over time.\"[175]\n\n\nOverall, Yellen's visit was part of a broader push by the Biden administration to rebuild bridges between the two countries and open more lines of high-level communication with America’s main geopolitical rival, in particular with China's new economic leaders. In a press conference capping her four-day trip to Beijing, Yellen described it as a mission to revive engagement between the two largest economies and said she believes it has brought US-China ties closer to a \"surer footing.\"[176]\n\n\n\"We certainly have improved communication,\" Yellen said regarding China in an October interview with Sky News. The U.S. established a set of principles to govern Sino-American relations, Yellen said. These principles are: 1. The U.S. will always protect its national security and call out human rights abuses, 2. The U.S. is not seeking to decouple economically from China, and 3. The U.S. and China need to cooperate on a variety of global challenges, including climate change and debt relief.[177]\n\n\n**Comments on Israel**\n\n\nWhen asked about the potential economic implications of Israel's war with Hamas, Yellen told Sky News in an October 2023 interview, \"I think it's too early to speculate on whether or not there will be significant consequences. I think, importantly, it depends on whether the hostilities extend beyond Israel and Gaza, and that's certainly an outcome we would like to avoid.\"[177]\n\n\nYellen maintained that the U.S. can manage funding wars in both Israel and Ukraine, saying, \"America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel's military needs and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia.\"\n\n\n\n## Economic philosophy[edit]\n\n\nYellen is widely considered to be a \"dove\" on monetary policy (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and, as such, generally favors lower rather than higher Federal Reserve interest rates.[178][179][180] She was overall in favor of more stringent financial regulation to lessen systemic risks brought on by flaws in the financial system.[181] Yellen was arguably the most liberal Federal Reserve leader since Marriner S. Eccles, who was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt amidst the Great Depression in 1934.[7] On fiscal policy, publications frequently refer to her as \"sort of\" a deficit hawk.[180][182] She expressed concern about the United States fiscal path prior to the COVID-19 recession, particularly about the national debt; in 2018, she said, \"If I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\"[180] The following year, she again suggested that she favored both raising revenue and making changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs to control spending.[180] In September 2021, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Yellen lent support to efforts for the complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the borrowing cap is \"very destructive\" and poses an unnecessary threat to the American economy.[183]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Yellen was among the 45 original signers of the Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends, which was eventually signed by over 3,500 prominent American economists promoting a carbon dividends framework for the U.S. policy on climate change.[184] In October 2020, the Group of Thirty's Steering Committee Working Group on Climate Change and Finance, which Yellen co-chaired with Mark Carney, prepared a report that developed a robust and inclusive strategy to amplify and mainstream the global transition to a net-zero emissions economy.[185] The study calls upon governments, businesses, and financial institutions to assess climate risks and supports a phase-in of carbon pricing to accelerate a shift to carbon neutrality.[186]\n\n\nYellen is a Keynesian economist and has been described as a \"Keynesian to her fingertips\".[187] In April 1999, Yellen discussed her views on the application of Keynesian economics to policymaking at the Yale economics department reunion. She stated that while most economists \"appreciate the value of markets and incentives,\" Yalies \"can recognize when they are not operating correctly and have higher concern for policies to remedy them.\"[188] During the financial crisis of a decade ago, she \"warned against an over-hasty removal of stimulus,\" and \"believes the state has a duty to tackle poverty and inequality.\"[189] When her appointment as treasury secretary was announced, Yellen was viewed by Wall Street as a \"Treasury secretary who will push hard for expansionary policies aimed at boosting growth, profits and share prices,\" although the ability of Yellen to push through her preferred fiscal policies was seen as likely to be constrained by congressional gridlock.[189]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nYellen has received numerous honors in recognition of her career in academia and politics. These include:\n\n\n\n### Academic[edit]\n\n\n\n\nChancellor, visitor, governor, rector, and fellowships\n| Location\n | Date\n | Organization\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) New York\n | 1986–1987 | John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation | Guggenheim Fellowship[190] |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | 2000–2006\n | Yale Corporation | Alumni Fellow[191] |\n| ![](image) California\n | 2003–2004\n | Western Economic Association International | President[192] |\n| ![](image) Tennessee\n | 2004–2005\n | American Economic Association | Vice President[193]* Served with Angus Deaton\n |\n| ![](image) California\n | 2013–present\n | University of California, Berkeley | Berkeley Fellow[194] |\n| ![](image) Tennessee\n | 2020–2021\n | American Economic Association | President[195] |\n\n\n\n\nHonorary degrees\n| Location\n | Date\n | School\n | Degree\n | Gave Commencement Address\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Rhode Island\n | May 25, 1998\n | Brown University | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[196] | Yes[197] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | May 27, 2000\n | Bard College | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[198] | No\n |\n| ![](image) New York\n | May 21, 2014\n | New York University | Doctor of Commercial Science (DCS)[199] | Yes[200] |\n| ![](image) England\n | May 15, 2015\n | London School of Economics | Doctor of Science (DSc)[201] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | May 15, 2015\n | Yale University | Doctor of Social Science (DSSc)[202] | No\n |\n| ![](image) England\n | November 19, 2015\n | University of Warwick | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[203] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Maryland\n | December 19, 2016\n | University of Baltimore | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[204] | Yes[205] |\n| ![](image) Israel\n | June 5, 2019\n | Tel Aviv University | Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)[206] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Michigan\n | December 15, 2019\n | University of Michigan | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[207] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Pennsylvania\n | May 17, 2021\n | University of Pennsylvania | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[208] | No\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Memberships and fellowships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Location\n | Date\n | Organization\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Massachusetts\n | 1999–2010\n | National Bureau of Economic Research | Research Associate (Monetary Economics)[209] |\n| ![](image) Massachusetts\n | 2001–present\n | American Academy of Arts and Sciences | Member[210] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | 2002–2010\n | Economists for Peace and Security | Trustee[211] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | 2005–present\n | Council on Foreign Relations | Member[25] |\n| ![](image) District of Columbia\n | 2009–present\n | Group of Thirty | Senior Member[212] |\n| ![](image) Tennessee\n | 2012–present\n | American Economic Association | Distinguished Fellow[213] |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | 2014–present\n | Econometric Society | Fellow[214] |\n| ![](image) District of Columbia\n | 2010–present\n | National Association for Business Economics | NABE Fellow[215] |\n| ![](image) England\n | 2016–present\n | British Academy | Honorary Fellow[216] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Location\n | Date\n | Organisation\n | Award\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | May 26, 1997\n | Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | Wilbur Cross Medal[217] |\n| ![](image) District of Columbia\n | October 11, 2010\n | National Association for Business Economics | Adam Smith Award[218] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | January 22, 2015\n | Hobart and William Smith Colleges | Elizabeth Blackwell Award[219] |\n| ![](image) Massachusetts\n | May 27, 2016\n | Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study | Radcliffe Medal[220] |\n| ![](image) Rhode Island\n | May 5, 2017\n | Brown University | The President's Medal[221] |\n| ![](image) Illinois\n | November 7, 2017\n | *Institute of Government and Public Affairs* | The Paul H.

Ellis endowed *The Janet L. Yellen Chair* at the Yale School of Management, which was named after her. Professor Andrew Metrick has been invested as the inaugural *Janet L. Yellen Professor of Finance and Management* at the School.[227]\n* In December 2018, *Federal Reserve Board* presented an annual *Janet L. Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development* to recognize the exemplary work of Federal Reserve System staff, intended to honor former chair Yellen's commitment to public service.[228] Ariel Cisneros of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has been named the first recipient of the newly created award.[229]\n* Yellen has been named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by *Time* magazine four times. This occurred in the years 2014,[230] 2015,[231] 2017,[232] and 2023.[233] Additionally, she was named a runner-up for *Time* Person of the Year in 2022.[234]\n* Yellen has been ranked on multiple occasions in *Forbes* magazine's list of the world's 100 most powerful women. She was named the second-most powerful woman in the world in 2014.[235] *Forbes* also ranked her several times on its list of the world's most powerful people. She was named the sixth-most powerful person in the world in 2014 and 2016.[236]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nYellen is married to George Akerlof, an economist who is a university professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and Koshland Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as a 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate.[22][237] The couple met in the fall of 1977, became engaged by that December, and married in June 1978, less than a year after meeting.[238][21] Their son, Robert Akerlof (born 1981), is a fellow economist. He received a bachelor's *summa cum laude* in economics and mathematics from Yale University and earned his PhD in economics from Harvard University, where he was a Presidential Scholar. Robert is an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick.[239]\n\n\nYellen and Akerlof have often collaborated on research, including topics such as poverty, unemployment and a paper on the costs of out-of-wedlock childbearing. One of their most discussed papers at Berkeley, on why lower wages sometimes lead to lower employment, came from the personal experience of hiring a nanny for the first time.[238] Yellen says Akerlof has been her biggest intellectual influence.[238] Both frequently state that their lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than he is.[21][22]\n\n\nYellen has an estimated net worth of $20 million, accrued from stock holdings, speaking engagements, and various government and academic positions.[240] Upon taking office as U.S. Treasury Secretary, she divested her shares including those in Pfizer, ConocoPhillips, and AT&T, among others.[241]\n\n\nYellen inherited from her mother a collection of postage stamps worth between $15,000 and $50,000.[242][115] She doesn't collect them on her own.[243]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n\"Who's Yellen Now?\" is a song by Dessa, a member of the indie hip-hop collective Doomtree and contributor to *The Hamilton Mixtape*. *Marketplace* commissioned the song after then-President-elect Biden announced his intention to nominate Yellen as the nation's first female Treasury Secretary and joked that Lin-Manuel Miranda should write a Hamiltonesque musical about her.[244] In addition, *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* premiered a parody of Hamilton's opening song about Yellen.[245]\n\n\nOn NBC's sketch comedy show *Saturday Night Live* (SNL), Yellen has been parodied by SNL cast member Kate McKinnon in 2021.[246]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Akerlof, George A.; Yellen, Janet L., eds.

She previously served as the 15th chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018. She is the first person to hold those positions having also led the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the first woman to hold either post.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Yellen graduated from Brown University in 1967 and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in 1971. She taught as an assistant professor at Harvard University from 1971 to 1976, was a staff economist for the Federal Reserve Board from 1977 to 1978, and was a faculty member at the London School of Economics from 1978 to 1980. Yellen is professor emeritus at the Haas School of Business and the University of California, Berkeley, where she has been a faculty member since 1980 and became the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics.\n\n\nYellen served as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 1994 to 1997 and was nominated to the position by President Bill Clinton, who then named her chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999. She subsequently returned to academia before being appointed president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 2004 until 2010. Afterward, President Barack Obama chose her to replace Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve from 2010 to 2014 before nominating her to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve three years later. She was succeeded by Jerome Powell after President Donald Trump declined to renominate her for a second term. Following her resignation from the Federal Reserve, Yellen joined the Brookings Institution as a distinguished fellow in residence from 2018 until 2020, when she again went into public service.[2]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2020, then-President-elect Joe Biden nominated Yellen to serve as secretary of the treasury; she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 25, 2021, and took office the next day.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nYellen was born on August 13, 1946,[4] to a family of Polish Jewish[5] ancestry in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, neighborhood of New York City, and grew up there.[6] Her mother was Anna Ruth (née Blumenthal; 1907–1986), an elementary school teacher who gave up her teaching job to become a stay-at-home mother. Her father was Julius Yellen (1906–1975), a family physician who worked from the ground floor of their house. Janet has an older brother, John (born 1942), who is a program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation.[7][8]\n\n\nIn a speech at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Yellen said that her father's family immigrated to the United States from Sokołów Podlaski, a small town about 50 miles outside of Warsaw. She shared that nearly the entirety of its Jewish population, including many of her relatives, was deported or murdered during the Holocaust.[9]\n\n\nYellen attended the local Fort Hamilton High School, where she was an honor society member and participated in the booster club, the psychology club, and the history club.[8] She also served as editor-in-chief of *The Pilot*, the school newspaper, which continued its 13-year streak as the first-place winner of the prestigious Columbia Scholastic Press Association contest under her leadership.[10] She earned a National Merit commendation letter and was admitted to a selective science honors program at Columbia University to voluntarily study mathematics on Saturday mornings. Yellen was one of 30 students to win state Regents scholarships for college and one of a select few to win the mayor's citation for a scholarship.[10] She graduated in 1963 as the valedictorian of her class. In line with school tradition, for the editor to interview the valedictorian, she interviewed herself in the third person.[11][8][10]\n\n\nYellen enrolled at Pembroke College in Brown University, initially intending to study philosophy. During her freshman year, she switched her planned major to economics and was particularly influenced by professors George Herbert Borts and Herschel Grossman.[12] In the spring of 1964, she also joined the business staff of *The Brown Daily Herald*, but soon afterward she left the paper to focus on her academic studies.[13] Yellen graduated *summa cum laude* and Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's in economics from Brown University in 1967,[14] and earned her master's and PhD in economics from Yale University in 1971.[15] Her dissertation was titled *Employment, Output and Capital Accumulation in an Open Economy: A Disequilibrium Approach* under the supervision of James Tobin,[16] a noted economist who would later receive the Nobel Memorial Prize.[17] As a teaching assistant, Yellen was so meticulous in her note-taking during Tobin's macroeconomics class that her notes became the unofficial textbook and were referred to as \"Yellen Notes\" while being circulated among generations of graduate students.[17] Her former professor and Nobel Prize in Economics laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, has called her one of his brightest and most memorable students.[18] She later described Yale professors Tobin and William Brainard as \"lifelong mentors\" who laid the intellectual groundwork for her economic views.[19] Yellen was the only woman among the two dozen economists who earned their doctorates from Yale in 1971.[18]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter receiving her Ph.D., Yellen obtained the position of assistant professor of economics at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976.[20] At that time, she was one of only two female faculty members in Harvard's economics department; the other woman was Rachel McCulloch. The pair struck up a close friendship and went on to write several academic papers together.[18] In 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors after failing to win tenure at Harvard; she was recruited as a staff economist for the Board of Governors by Edwin M. Truman, who had known her from Yale. Truman was a junior professor when he heard Yellen's oral exam and was then about to take over the Fed's Division of International Finance. She was assigned to research international monetary reform.[21]\n\n\nWhile at the Fed, she met her husband, economist George Akerlof, in the bank's cafeteria; they married in 1978, less than a year later.[21] By the time of their marriage, Akerlof had already accepted a teaching position at the London School of Economics (LSE). Yellen left her post at the Fed to accompany him and was given a tenure-track lectureship by LSE. The couple stayed in the United Kingdom for two years before returning to the United States, in part due to identity issues because they felt American, not English.[22]\n\n\nIn 1980, Yellen joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, where she taught at the Haas School of Business to conduct macroeconomics research and teach undergraduate and MBA students for more than two decades. She earned the Haas School's outstanding teaching award twice, in 1985 and 1988.[23] Prof. Yellen became just the second woman at Berkeley-Haas to earn tenure in 1982, as well as the title of full professor in 1985.[23] She was named the Bernard T. Rocca, Jr. Professor of International Business and Trade in 1992.[24][25]\n\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, Yellen took a leave of absence from Berkeley to go into public service. After returning to academia, she resumed her teaching assignment at Haas and received a joint appointment with Berkeley's Department of Economics.[26] She was appointed the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics in 1999[24] and remained an active faculty member until she was appointed president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004.[27] Yellen was awarded the title of Professor Emeritus at UC Berkeley in 2006.[25]\n\n\nThroughout her career, Yellen served as an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, and the National Science Foundation's Panel in Economics. She was also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1999 to 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n### Contributions to economics[edit]\n\n\nYellen's academic career has largely focused on the analysis of the mechanisms of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade. She has written a few widely cited papers, often collaborating on research with her husband, Professor George Akerlof.[28][29]\n\n\n\n#### Efficiency wage models[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, Yellen and Akerlof have addressed what's known in the economics literature as \"efficiency wage theory\" – the idea that paying people more than the market wage does increase their productivity. Their 1990 paper, entitled \"The Fair-Wage Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment\", coined \"the fair wage effort hypothesis\" and was considered by economists to be a significant contribution to the topic: \"A precursor to the efficiency wage literature...it had an influence, although the work on efficiency wage theory has had a bigger influence.\"[30] Akerlof and Yellen introduced the gift-exchange game, which argues that workers who are paid less than what they consider to be a fair wage will purposefully work less hard to exact revenge on their employer.[30][28]\n\n\n\n#### Reproductive technology shock[edit]\n\n\nAnother work, \"An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States\", co-written with Akerlof and Michael Katz and published in 1996, aims to explain why out-of-wedlock births have grown considerably in previous decades in the United States. A research study led to a theory called \"reproductive technology shock\", arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s, amidst the sexual revolution, eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy, and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood.[31] At the same time, this transformation encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations.[32]\n\n\n\n## Federal Reserve (1994–1997)[edit]\n\n\nOn April 22, 1994, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Yellen as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, alongside Alan Blinder, who has been designated as vice chairman. They were the first Democratic appointees to the Board since 1980.[33][34] In an issued statement, the president praised her as \"one of the most prominent economists of her generation on the intersection of macroeconomics and labor markets.\"[35] President Clinton played an indirect role in the selection process, delegating most of the responsibility to NEC Director Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and CEA Chair Laura Tyson, who was a colleague of Yellen's at Berkeley. The group settled on her candidacy after an exhaustive search that at one point included nearly 50 names.[33] In July 1994, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said that Fed policies should keep the economy growing as much as possible without accelerating inflation but avoid taking a clear position on the prospect of further increases in interest rates.[36] The Senate panel approved her nomination without much Republican opposition, by a vote of 18 to 1; the only dissenting vote came from Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), who said that her concerns should be limited to inflation.[37] The nomination was confirmed in the full United States Senate by a vote of 94–6.[38] On August 12, 1994, Yellen was appointed to a full 14-year term and assumed the seat vacated by Republican Wayne Angell.[37] She was installed as the fourth female governor, joining Susan M. Phillips, which marks the first time that two women have sat on the Federal Reserve Board simultaneously.[39]\n\n\nIn July 1996, the Federal Reserve resisted pressure to raise interest rates as unemployment dropped. Yellen marshaled academic research to dissuade Chairman Alan Greenspan from committing the Fed to a zero inflation policy and demonstrate that the central bank should seek to moderate inflation rather than eliminate it. According to the study, a low inflation rate of around 2 percent provided a better foundation for reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth than the goal of zero.[40]\n\n\nUpon her confirmation as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, she resigned as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 17, 1997.\n\n\n\n## Council of Economic Advisers (1997–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official photo as CEA chair, c. 1990s\nOn December 20, 1996, Yellen joined the Clinton administration as chair of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), replacing Joseph Stiglitz in office.[41] She was reluctant to leave the Federal Reserve, but White House officials talked her into a job, passing over others with greater marquee value because, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, \"We wanted someone who could bring a rigorous analytic approach to the issues and who could work well with others.\"[42] Yellen was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1997,[43] thereby becoming the second woman to serve as chief economic advisor to the president after Laura Tyson.[44][42] While serving within the Administration, she concurrently chaired the OECD Economic Policy Committee from 1997 to 1999.[25]\n\n\nDuring her time with the Council of Economic Advisers, Yellen oversaw a June 1998 report, \"Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap\",[45] which focused on the gender pay divide. Within this study, the Council analyzed data from 1969 to 1996 to determine the reasons why women earn substantially less than men. By observing trends attributable to issues such as occupation and industry, as well as familial status, it was determined that while the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a step forward, there was no explanation for a 25-percent difference between average pay for women and men – an improvement from the 40-percent gap two decades earlier. It was concluded that this gap had no correlation with differences in productivity and, as such, was the result of discrimination within the workforce.[18]\n\n\nIn June 1999, Yellen announced that she was stepping down from the CEA for personal reasons and would return to teaching at UC Berkeley.[46] It was reported that President Clinton asked her to take over from Alice Rivlin, the central bank's vice chairwoman – an offer she turned down.[47]\n\n\n\n## Return to the Federal Reserve (2004–2018)[edit]\n\n\n### Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco[edit]\n\n\nOn April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T. Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14.[48] She was the first woman to hold this position.[18] While serving as Federal Reserve District president, she sat on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and was a voting member once every three years on a rotating basis, with her first being in 2006.[48] During her time at the San Francisco Fed, the largest of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks in terms of population and economic output, Yellen publicly downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of the boom in housing prices; at FOMC meetings, on the contrary, she sounded the alarm on banks' heavy concentration in risky construction and home-development loans.[49] On the other hand, she did not lead the San Francisco Fed to \"move to check [the] increasingly indiscriminate lending\" of Countrywide Financial, the United States' largest lender.[50][51]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2009, Yellen said that the Federal Reserve should consider raising interest rates earlier to prevent another housing bubble. She argued that higher short-term interest rates probably went against the expansion of a bubble in certain circumstances, like restraining the demand for housing and high-risk mortgages.[52]\n\n\nIn July 2009, Yellen was mentioned as a potential successor to Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term was set to expire before he was re-nominated for a second four-year term.[53] She eventually emerged as the leading contender for vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board in March 2010,[54] and following her Senate confirmation, she resigned from the San Francisco Fed in October of that year.[55]\n\n\n\n### Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen takes the oath of office administered by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke in the Eccles Building, October 4, 2010\nOn April 28, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Yellen to succeed Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve.[56] In July 2010, the Senate Banking Committee voted 17–6 to confirm her, though the top Republican on the panel, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted no, saying \"President Yellen presided over a regional housing bubble and failed to restrain the excesses.\"[57]\n\n\nAround the same time, on the heels of related testimony by Fed chairman Bernanke, FOMC voting member James B. Bullard of the St. Louis Fed stated that the U.S. economy was at risk of becoming \"enmeshed in a Japanese-style deflationary outcome within the next several years.\"[58] That statement was interpreted as a possible shift within the FOMC balance between inflation hawks and doves. Yellen's pending confirmation, along with those of Peter Diamond and Sarah Bloom Raskin to fill vacancies, was seen as possibly furthering such a shift in the FOMC. All three nominations were seen as \"on track to be confirmed by the Senate.\"[58]\n\n\nOn September 29, 2010, Yellen, along with Raskin,[59] was confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote to be both a member of the board of governors[60] and vice chairman of the Federal Reserve System.[61] On October 4, the pair were sworn in as Fed governors, while Yellen also took the oath of office as vice chair of the board for a four-year term.[55] Simultaneously, she began a 14-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, filling a vacant seat last held by Mark W. Olson.[55] Yellen was just the second woman to hold the Federal Reserve's No. 2 post, after Alice Rivlin.[62]\n\n\nIn contrast to her predecessors, Yellen acted more independently within the institution in her role as vice chair.[63] She has been urging Bernanke and the other FOMC members to follow her preferred route for monetary policy, arguing for more forceful actions to inject money into the economy to reduce unemployment.[64] Yellen played a leading role in moving the Federal Reserve to announce its inflation target of two percent a year after her long campaign with Chairman Bernanke; she was an early supporter of inflation targeting, facing opposition from Chairman Greenspan during her first stint at the Fed in the 1990s.[65][63]\n\n\nYellen was widely considered the front-runner to succeed Bernanke as the Federal Reserve's chair when his second term ceased.[65][66][67] Lawrence Summers, a former President Clinton's Treasury Secretary and former director of President Obama's National Economic Council, was the other leading contender in the highly publicized race; media outlets reported that the president was leaning toward selecting the latter candidate.[68] However, throughout the race, Summers drew criticism from both sides of the aisle for his role in deregulating parts of the banking sector while he served in the Clinton administration. He sparked further controversy for remarks on women's aptitude in math and science, which he made in 2005 while serving as Harvard University's president.[18] In July 2013, Yellen was pushed to be named the first chairwoman of the central bank in a letter that was circulated among the Senate Democrats and had been signed by almost a third of the 54 caucus senators, who primarily represent the liberal wing of the party.[69] In addition, more than 500 professional economists from around 200 colleges and universities across the United States signed an open letter in support of her candidacy for Fed chair and sent it to the White House.[70] After weeks of opposition to his potential nomination, Summers withdrew his name from consideration for the position in September.[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Chair of the Federal Reserve[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait as Federal Reserve chair, 2015\n![](image)From left to right: Janet Yellen, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke, and Paul Volcker, May 1, 2014\n![](image)Yellen in conversation with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde, July 2, 2014\nOn October 9, 2013, Yellen was officially nominated to replace Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve,[73][74] the first vice chair ever to be elevated to that post.[75] While announcing his decision, President Obama called her \"one of the nation's foremost economists and policymakers\" and said that \"America's workers and their families will have a champion in Janet Yellen.\"[76] During the nomination hearings held in November, Yellen defended the more than $3 trillion in stimulus funds that the central bank had been injecting into the U.S. economy.[77] She also said that it is important for the Fed to try to detect asset bubbles and that if she saw one, she would work to address it.[78]\n\n\nOn December 20, 2013, the U.S. Senate voted 59–34 for cloture on Yellen's nomination.[79] On January 6, 2014, she was confirmed as chair of the Federal Reserve by a vote of 56–26,[80] the narrowest margin ever for the position.[81] Yellen was a trailblazer as the first woman to head the U.S. central bank, or any major central bank, and the first Democrat to do so since Paul Volcker assumed that position in 1979 via President Jimmy Carter.[1] She was sworn into office on February 3, 2014,[82] and was previously elected as FOMC chair on January 30.[83] According to a Fed representative, on Yellen's request, her title would be altered to \"chair\" rather than \"chairman\" or \"chairwoman\", as she prefers a gender-neutral manner.[62][18] Only one woman had ever led the central bank of a G8 country before Yellen – Russia's Elvira Nabiullina.[84]\n\n\nIn July 2014, at her first semi-annual congressional testimony on U S. monetary policy, Yellen said, \"while real estate, equities, and corporate bond prices have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased they were generally in line with historical norms.\" She also acknowledged some concerns about the valuations of lower-rated corporate debt and affirmed that she and other Fed officials were monitoring trends but did not believe that a so-called \"everything bubble\" was forming.[85]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2015, the Federal Reserve under Yellen increased its key interest rate for the first time since 2006.[86] That move was largely expected because extraordinarily low rates for an extremely long time may contribute to financial instability and pose a threat to the economy, and was considered a departure from the previous controversial Fed policy, commonly known as the \"Greenspan put\".[87][88] During her tenure, the Fed has gradually raised rates four additional times, leaving its key rate in a still-low range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percent – well below historical standards.[89]\n\n\nFollowing the 2016 presidential election, Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd–Frank Act in her Joint Economic Committee testimony, standing in opposition to incoming President Donald Trump's plans to review the landmark legislation. She argued that it would be inappropriate to weaken or repeal the law designed to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis.[90] Yellen provided further support for financial regulations enacted in the wake of the Great Recession in a speech to the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on August 25, 2017. In her remarks about the aftermath of the crisis, she said, \"The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.\" Yellen warned that any adjustment to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience.[91]\n\n\nIn November 2017, as Yellen's tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve was coming to an end, Trump considered nominating her for another term, but on the advice of his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, he picked a Republican Fed governor, Jerome Powell, instead.[92] Yellen made her resignation from the Federal Reserve Board at the conclusion of her chairmanship known after Trump's choice, despite still having her assignment as Fed governor until 2024.[93] She served a single term and became just the second Federal Reserve chair eligible for reappointment not renominated by a successor presidential administration, the first being Arthur F. Burns almost 40 years prior.[94] That unusual departure makes her the briefest-serving central bank chief since G. William Miller, who held that office for over a year, from 1978 to 1979.[95]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2018, Yellen enforced enormous sanctions on Wells Fargo, which was the third-largest U.S. bank at the time, with a consent order restricting the firm's expansion unless it resolved its internal issues.[96][97] That move came in response to a string of \"widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns\" at the company, particularly a fake account scandal,[98] and marked the first time the Fed has imposed a cap on the entire assets of a financial institution.[97]\n\n\nRegarding labor markets, Yellen has been dubbed one of the Federal Reserve System's most successful chairpersons. During her term, the unemployment rate dropped from 6.7 percent to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years.[99][100][89] For the first time since central bank creation, the economy added jobs throughout every month of any Fed chair's tenure.[100] Yellen completed her time at the Fed with the lowest final unemployment rate of any Fed chair since William McChesney Martin in 1970.[101] Under her leadership, the U.S. unemployment rate fell more than during any other chair's term in the post-World War II era, declining 2.6 percentage points.[101] On the other hand, inflation remained below the Fed's annual two percent target, which led to the suggestion that the central bank could have done even more to bolster the economy without the risk of price increases.[102]\n\n\nYellen became the first person in U.S. central bank history to have served as a Federal Reserve chair (2014–2018), vice chair (2010–2014), district president (FRB of San Francisco, 2004–2010), Fed governor (1994–1997 and 2010–2018), and staff economist (1977–1978).[103]\n\n\n\n## After the Federal Reserve (2018–2020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen delivers her farewell speech to Federal Reserve staff, February 1, 2018\nOn February 2, 2018, the Brookings Institution announced that Yellen would join the think tank as a distinguished fellow in residence with the Economic Studies program, effective February 5, 2018.[104] She's been affiliated with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings.[105] On July 31, 2018, the Hutchins Center announced Yellen, James H. Stock, and Louise Sheiner as co-chairs of the newly launched Productivity Measurement Initiative, aimed at improving the quality of economic statistics.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Yellen left her position at Brookings after being selected as a nominee to serve as Treasury secretary.[2] Within the think tank, she has been providing expertise and commentary on a range of economic issues, offering her perspective and analysis at Brookings panels, congressional testimony, lectures across the United States and abroad, and regularly serving as a commentator in the media.[2]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2017, Yellen stated that she did not expect another financial crisis \"in our lifetime\" because she thought banks were \"much stronger\" as a result of Federal Reserve oversight.[107] In a December 10, 2018 conversation with Paul Krugman at the City University of New York, she warned of the possibility of another financial crisis by citing \"gigantic holes in the system\" after she departs from the Federal Reserve.[108]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2019, in an interview with *Marketplace*, when asked if she believed Trump has \"a grasp of macroeconomic policy,\" Yellen replied, \"No, I do not.\"[109] She expressed her doubts about the president's ability to articulate the Federal Reserve's explicit goals of \"maximum employment and price stability\" and emphasized his assertions that the Federal Reserve's goals include trade, which she explains are objectively false. She raised further concern over Trump's regard for the independence of the central bank and voiced support for her successor, Jerome Powell.[109] This interview marked a notable change in tone for Yellen, who traditionally handled her differences with the president in a neutral manner.[110]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2020, at the hearing of the House Select Oversight Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which was set up by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, former Federal Reserve chairs Bernanke and Yellen testified about the economic policy response to the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic. They urged lawmakers to act aggressively with fiscal stimulus in three areas: extending the supplementary unemployment payments; providing additional financial assistance to hard-hit states and local governments; and investing in the medical response to the pandemic.[111] She also expressed this commitment to stimulus in an op-ed for *The New York Times* with Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.[112]\n\n\nIn August 2020, it was reported that Yellen was among a handful of economists who briefed former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, and his chosen running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, on economic issues.[113] The meeting was one of the first times the Biden campaign announced its economic expert, whom few at the time predicted would take a presidential cabinet post.[114]\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2020, Yellen received over $7 million in speaking fees from financial companies such as Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and the hedge fund Citadel after leaving the Federal Reserve.[115][116][117] With her return to government, she pledged to get official permission from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to participate in substantive issues involving such firms to avoid any conflict of interest.[118][117]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of the Treasury (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris receive an economic briefing from Treasury Secretary Yellen in the Oval Office, January 29, 2021\nFollowing the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a possible secretary of the treasury in the incoming Biden administration.[119][120] She edged out other top contenders to obtain the position, including Fed Board Gov. Lael Brainard and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman.[114][121]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2020, then-President-elect Biden announced he would nominate Yellen as Treasury Secretary in his cabinet.[122][123] In his remarks on the announcement, Biden lauded her as \"one of the most important economic thinkers of our time\" who \"spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work.\"[124] Despite being a highly respected figure across the political spectrum and expected to win confirmation easily, she was considered an unusual pick for the position because of her lack of experience in political maneuvering. Unlike her predecessors, she is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to achieving the goals of Biden's economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress.[125][126][127] All living former U.S. treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed Yellen for the position in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm her.[128]\n\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved Yellen's candidacy by a 26–0 vote on January 22, 2021.[129] The full U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination with a vote of 84–15 (with one abstention, Marco Rubio, R-FL)[130] on January 25.[131] With her oath of office administered by Vice President Harris the next day,[132] Yellen became the first female Secretary of the Treasury and the first person in American history to lead the three most powerful economic bodies in the federal government of the United States: the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.[3][131]\n\n\nOnly two other women within the G7 nations – France's Christine Lagarde and Canada's Chrystia Freeland – have held positions analogous to Yellen's as Treasury Secretary.[133]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### Proposed international tax reform[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen meeting with German finance minister Olaf Scholz, July 2, 2021\nIn April 2021, Yellen proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance.[134] In an accompanying written piece for *The Wall Street Journal*, she outlined the enormous benefits of the discussed tax system for the US economy as well as the global economy.[135] On June 5, 2021, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to reinstate a minimum worldwide corporate tax rate of at least 15% as part of a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system, while \nFrance's Bruno Le Maire called it \"a starting point\" that could be increased in the future.[136] A few days later, Treasury Secretary Yellen co-wrote an op-ed for *The Washington Post* with four of her international counterparts, describing the new agreement as \"an historic opportunity to end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation, restoring government resources at a time when they are most needed.\"[137] The next month, financial leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a \"more stable and fair international tax architecture.\"[138]\n\n\nIn October 2021, more than 130 countries, accounting for more than 90% of global GDP, including several low-tax jurisdictions that had previously fought the pact, enforced through the OECD a landmark agreement to establish a global minimum tax rate of 15% for businesses worldwide. The projected gain from the deal, which was anticipated to take effect in 2023, may result in an increase of $150 billion in annual tax revenues. It is worth noting, however, that the treaty's implementation path remains uncertain because its ratification requires a two-thirds majority in the evenly divided U.S. Senate as well as passing domestic legislation in each of the signed countries.[139]\n\n\n\n#### Debt ceiling crisis[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2021, Yellen sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders in which she urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the nation's debt limit as soon as possible before it hit its statutory limit in August and the government would be unable to pay its bills. She warned Congress that failing to meet those financial obligations would cause \"irreparable harm\" to the U.S. economy and that the Treasury Department would take \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent the United States from suffering a government shutdown or even a debt default.[140]\n\n\nOn September 19, 2021, Yellen, in an op-ed for *The Wall Street Journal*, again called for an increase in the debt ceiling; otherwise, sometime in October, the Treasury expected to exhaust its cash reserves, which would trigger a financial crisis.[141] After lawmakers adopted a short-term debt ceiling bill to raise the United States' borrowing limit through early December, she said that a longer-term measure should be provided to ensure certainty in government's solvency.[142] In November, Yellen expressed her willingness to consider solutions to the debt crisis without GOP support if necessary, using a budget reconciliation as a viable alternative.[143] She also supported the idea for Democrats to raise the debt limit high enough that it would not be reached until after the 2024 general elections while the party holds a majority in both houses of Congress, therefore preventing the issue from being weaponized for political reasons.[144]\n\n\nIn December 2021, President Biden signed a debt ceiling increase into law, preventing a U.S. default, a day after the Treasury's previously estimated deadline to address the issue. Congressional legislation designated to cover the government's financial commitments beyond the 2022 midterm elections was passed in a nearly party-line vote.[145]\n\n\nIn January 2023, after Republicans took control over the House, Yellen informed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and new congressional leadership that the U.S. expected to hit the debt ceiling on January 19 and that the Treasury yet again would be forced to use \"extraordinary measures\" to prevent default, and it could last until June of that year. She repeated her call to \"act in a timely manner to increase or suspend the debt limit.\"[146] Yellen rejected the GOP plan on government payments prioritization once \"extraordinary measures\" are exhausted, insisting that her department doesn't have the systems to do so and that proposal effectively means a default.[147]\n\n\nOn June 3, 2023, President Biden signed into law bipartisan congressional legislation that suspended the public debt limit throughout his first term in office, therefore ending the ongoing debt-ceiling crisis. It came as a compromise on fiscal spending between the White House and House Republicans two days before the United States was estimated to reach the debt ceiling and subsequently could no longer meet its own financial obligations.[148]\n\n\n\n#### Sanctions against Russia and oil price cap[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Yellen and senior Treasury personnel were tasked with crafting a sanctions strategy that would maximize the costs inflicted on Russia's economy while limiting, if possible, \nthe expected negative impact on the United States and its allies if a potential aggression began.[149] The Treasury Department worked closely across government agencies and with US allies abroad to impose unprecedented international sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.[149]\n\n\nYellen was a key proponent of a price cap on Russian oil, a plan designed to deprive the Kremlin of funding for Russia's war in Ukraine while reducing an inflation surge by preserving the global oil supply.[150] On December 2, 2022, following months of lobbying and negotiations by the United States, the emerging alliance of the G7 nations, the European Union, and Australia agreed to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel as an upper limit, with regular reviews to check that the ceiling stays at least 5 percent below average market prices.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Digital Assets Regulation[edit]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2022, at American University's Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation, Yellen addressed for the first time the growing impact of digital assets on the American economy. Yellen outlined policy objectives and lessons that apply to the navigation of emerging technologies, which include \"first, the U.S. financial system benefits from responsible innovation; second, it's often society's vulnerable who suffer most in an economic crisis when regulation is not moving at the same pace as innovation; third, regulation should focus on activities and risk, not technology; fourth, sovereign money is the core of a functioning financial system; and fifth, it'll take thoughtful public and private dialogue between various groups to move forward.\"[152]\n\n\nYellen also announced possible plans for a government version of a stablecoin; the administration is studying the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital dollar while taking into consideration the impact of a CBDC on monetary policy, national security, and international trade, as well as its utility for consumers. Solving such problems is an \"engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months,\" she said.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Friendshoring of supply chains[edit]\n\n\nIn a speech delivered at the Atlantic Council on April 13, 2022, Yellen advised against the supply chain risks posed by reliance on commodities from countries that aligned with authoritarian regimes like Russia or China and favored friendshoring strategy, an approach that limits supply chain networks to allies and partner countries. She said that any moves from the other nations to undermine collective international effort to make Russia accountable for its aggression would draw the ire of the U.S. and its allies.[154] Yellen also called for the modernization of international financial institutions so that they could meet the world's 21st-century challenges, invoking precedent of the Bretton Woods Conference, which was held during the Second World War to discuss post-war economic order.[155]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Yellen wrote an essay for *Project Syndicate* in which she singled out the key risks for the U.S. economy that may be mitigated with the implementation of friendshoring policies. Those risks include: \"first, over-concentration of critical goods in any particular market may result in vulnerability in supply chains that hurt workers and customers; second, the need to protect from geopolitical and security risks emanating from hostile states; and third, the need to shift away from supply chains that relied on violations of core human rights, such as the use of forced labour in producing goods for import.\"[156]\n\n\n\n#### Comments on *Roe v. Wade* overturning[edit]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2022, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Yellen made comments on the economic consequences of *Roe v. Wade* overturning after a leaked draft majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* showed the Supreme Court was poised to overrule its previous decisions that legalized abortion in the United States. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked what reversing the landmark ruling would mean economically for the United States; Yellen responded, \"I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.\" She added that keeping women from accessing abortions \"increases their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance.\" Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) disagreed with her assertion and said, \"I think finding a way to have a debate around abortion in a meeting for the economic stability of our country is harsh.\" She replied, \"This is not harsh. This is the truth.\"[157]\n\n\nFollowing that heated exchange, Senator Scott penned an op-ed for *The Washington Post* in which he called Yellen's claim \"simply false\" and compared her arguments to those of Margaret Sanger in support of eugenics.[158] A number of prominent conservative media outlets and public figures alike similarly interpreted her comments on women's reproductive rights, responding with sharp criticism.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Internal Revenue Service reforms[edit]\n\n\nAfter the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, Yellen directed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 billion in additional funding over a decade to clear backlogs, improve taxpayer services, update technology, and hire thousands of new employees.[160]\n\n\nIn June 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was passed to reach a bipartisan agreement on debt ceiling, reallocated more than a quarter of the funding previously approved for IRS modernization to other budgetary areas. Despite that, Yellen assured that the agency still possesses the resources it needs in the near term to enhance service and ramp up enforcement. Furthermore, she said that the Treasury Department would continue to advocate for additional funds to make service improvements and help ensure that high-end taxpayers don't avoid paying their fair share.[161]\n\n\n\n#### Visit to Ukraine[edit]\n\n\nOn February 27, 2023, Yellen made a surprise visit to Kyiv, in which she reaffirmed ongoing U.S. economic support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's invasion, including nearly $50 billion in security, financial, and humanitarian aid the federal government has provided over the past year as Ukraine's largest bilateral donor. She met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to discuss the rollout of about $1.25 billion in budget relief, the first of a $10 billion package of civilian assistance for things like schools, hospitals, and emergency services, among others.[162]\n\n\nCoinciding with her visit, Yellen wrote an op-ed for *The New York Times* in which she highlighted the importance of America's support and repeated President Biden's message that Washington will stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes. She said, \"We cannot allow Ukraine to lose the war for economic reasons when it has shown an ability to succeed on the battlefield.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Banking crisis[edit]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2023, amidst the banking crisis, Yellen made an appearance on CBS' *Face the Nation* and affirmed that financial regulators closely monitored the state of the banking system to make sure it remained safe and well-capitalized. Addressing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, she said she had been working with bank regulators to \"design appropriate policies\" to tackle the issue, though declining to provide further details. She stressed that the possibility of a bailout was off the table.[164] Despite her statement, on the same day, Yellen approved actions enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors by announcing a systemic risk exception, with similar provisions being made for Signature Bank, another failed lender.[165] These extraordinary measures were taken to ensure confidence in the U.S. banking system and prevent spreading of a bank run.[166]\n\n\nOn March 21, Yellen delivered a speech to an American Bankers Association (ABA) summit in which she defended the forceful actions taken by regulators to avert a sweeping banking crisis and pledged resolute Biden administration support for lenders in need, regardless of their respective sizes. She said, \"Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system,\" and it was \"not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks.\" Yellen went on to assure that \"similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion.\"[167]\n\n\nNevertheless, Yellen stated in her testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government the following day that the FDIC was not considering providing \"blanket insurance or guarantees of deposits.\" She said uninsured bank deposits beyond the law-established $250,000 limit could be protected only if a failed bank was deemed to pose a systemic risk to the financial system, and that determination would occur only on a case-by-case basis by the regulators.[168]\n\n\nOn April 21, Yellen announced a proposal by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for a new procedure to designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision. It marked an effective reversal of previous guidance, which was issued in 2019 under the Trump administration and, according to Yellen, \"created inappropriate hurdles as part of the designation process.\" She said such a designation process \"could take six years to complete, which could prevent the council from acting to address an emerging risk to financial stability before it's too late.\" The revised guidance relied on a quantitative and qualitative analysis under which the council determined whether \"material financial distress at the company or the company's activities could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability\" and allowed for ample engagement between regulators and the company under review.[169]\n\n\nOn May 18, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) convened a meeting of more than two dozen bank CEOs to discuss the current state of the economy. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNN Business reported on Yellen's remarks that more bank mergers may be necessary to overcome the sector's crisis.[170]\n\n\n\n#### Economic approach to China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellen meet Premier Li Qiang\nIn a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023, Yellen laid out three principal objectives of the Biden administration's economic approach toward China. Those principles are: first, the paramount importance of securing American national security interests as well as protecting human rights; second, seeking healthy and fair economic competition with China based on international rules; and third, aiming to engage on major global challenges like easing the debt burden of the developing world and climate change.[171] Though she emphasized that national security would always take priority if it collided with economics, her address ought to be interpreted as an olive branch to Beijing instead of the confrontation that has for a long time prevailed in relations between the two nations. Yellen's speech attempted to revive dialogue, at least on economic matters, as she made clear her desire to visit China as soon as possible to get the countries' previously pragmatic approach to each other back on track. However, its ultimate success is not at all obvious.[172]\n\n\nBetween 6–9 July, Yellen visited China, the first trip to the country by a U.S. Treasury secretary in four years and her first since taking office. She began her visit by holding informal talks with the country's former vice premier Liu He, and People’s Bank of China (PBC) governor Yi Gang about the state of their domestic economies, as well as the global outlook, in a bid to reopen communication lines and find areas of common economic ground between the two nations.[173] Yellen then met with China's newly appointed economic team, including Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, finance minister Liu Kun, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) central bank chief Pan Gongsheng. During those bilateral meetings, she reaffirmed that the US national security restrictions on Chinese investment were intended to be narrowly focused and not have broad effects on the country's economy.[174] Yellen also expressed concerns about Chinese economic policies and went on to criticize the country's authorities for their treatment of foreign, particularly American, companies; she stated, \"We seek healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but that, with a fair set of rules, can benefit both countries over time.\"[175]\n\n\nOverall, Yellen's visit was part of a broader push by the Biden administration to rebuild bridges between the two countries and open more lines of high-level communication with America’s main geopolitical rival, in particular with China's new economic leaders. In a press conference capping her four-day trip to Beijing, Yellen described it as a mission to revive engagement between the two largest economies and said she believes it has brought US-China ties closer to a \"surer footing.\"[176]\n\n\n\"We certainly have improved communication,\" Yellen said regarding China in an October interview with Sky News. The U.S. established a set of principles to govern Sino-American relations, Yellen said. These principles are: 1. The U.S. will always protect its national security and call out human rights abuses, 2. The U.S. is not seeking to decouple economically from China, and 3. The U.S. and China need to cooperate on a variety of global challenges, including climate change and debt relief.[177]\n\n\n**Comments on Israel**\n\n\nWhen asked about the potential economic implications of Israel's war with Hamas, Yellen told Sky News in an October 2023 interview, \"I think it's too early to speculate on whether or not there will be significant consequences. I think, importantly, it depends on whether the hostilities extend beyond Israel and Gaza, and that's certainly an outcome we would like to avoid.\"[177]\n\n\nYellen maintained that the U.S. can manage funding wars in both Israel and Ukraine, saying, \"America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel's military needs and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia.\"\n\n\n\n## Economic philosophy[edit]\n\n\nYellen is widely considered to be a \"dove\" on monetary policy (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and, as such, generally favors lower rather than higher Federal Reserve interest rates.[178][179][180] She was overall in favor of more stringent financial regulation to lessen systemic risks brought on by flaws in the financial system.[181] Yellen was arguably the most liberal Federal Reserve leader since Marriner S. Eccles, who was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt amidst the Great Depression in 1934.[7] On fiscal policy, publications frequently refer to her as \"sort of\" a deficit hawk.[180][182] She expressed concern about the United States fiscal path prior to the COVID-19 recession, particularly about the national debt; in 2018, she said, \"If I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.\"[180] The following year, she again suggested that she favored both raising revenue and making changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs to control spending.[180] In September 2021, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Yellen lent support to efforts for the complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the borrowing cap is \"very destructive\" and poses an unnecessary threat to the American economy.[183]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Yellen was among the 45 original signers of the Economists' Statement on Carbon Dividends, which was eventually signed by over 3,500 prominent American economists promoting a carbon dividends framework for the U.S. policy on climate change.[184] In October 2020, the Group of Thirty's Steering Committee Working Group on Climate Change and Finance, which Yellen co-chaired with Mark Carney, prepared a report that developed a robust and inclusive strategy to amplify and mainstream the global transition to a net-zero emissions economy.[185] The study calls upon governments, businesses, and financial institutions to assess climate risks and supports a phase-in of carbon pricing to accelerate a shift to carbon neutrality.[186]\n\n\nYellen is a Keynesian economist and has been described as a \"Keynesian to her fingertips\".[187] In April 1999, Yellen discussed her views on the application of Keynesian economics to policymaking at the Yale economics department reunion. She stated that while most economists \"appreciate the value of markets and incentives,\" Yalies \"can recognize when they are not operating correctly and have higher concern for policies to remedy them.\"[188] During the financial crisis of a decade ago, she \"warned against an over-hasty removal of stimulus,\" and \"believes the state has a duty to tackle poverty and inequality.\"[189] When her appointment as treasury secretary was announced, Yellen was viewed by Wall Street as a \"Treasury secretary who will push hard for expansionary policies aimed at boosting growth, profits and share prices,\" although the ability of Yellen to push through her preferred fiscal policies was seen as likely to be constrained by congressional gridlock.[189]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nYellen has received numerous honors in recognition of her career in academia and politics. These include:\n\n\n\n### Academic[edit]\n\n\n\n\nChancellor, visitor, governor, rector, and fellowships\n| Location\n | Date\n | Organization\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) New York\n | 1986–1987 | John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation | Guggenheim Fellowship[190] |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | 2000–2006\n | Yale Corporation | Alumni Fellow[191] |\n| ![](image) California\n | 2003–2004\n | Western Economic Association International | President[192] |\n| ![](image) Tennessee\n | 2004–2005\n | American Economic Association | Vice President[193]* Served with Angus Deaton\n |\n| ![](image) California\n | 2013–present\n | University of California, Berkeley | Berkeley Fellow[194] |\n| ![](image) Tennessee\n | 2020–2021\n | American Economic Association | President[195] |\n\n\n\n\nHonorary degrees\n| Location\n | Date\n | School\n | Degree\n | Gave Commencement Address\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Rhode Island\n | May 25, 1998\n | Brown University | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[196] | Yes[197] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | May 27, 2000\n | Bard College | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[198] | No\n |\n| ![](image) New York\n | May 21, 2014\n | New York University | Doctor of Commercial Science (DCS)[199] | Yes[200] |\n| ![](image) England\n | May 15, 2015\n | London School of Economics | Doctor of Science (DSc)[201] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | May 15, 2015\n | Yale University | Doctor of Social Science (DSSc)[202] | No\n |\n| ![](image) England\n | November 19, 2015\n | University of Warwick | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[203] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Maryland\n | December 19, 2016\n | University of Baltimore | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[204] | Yes[205] |\n| ![](image) Israel\n | June 5, 2019\n | Tel Aviv University | Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)[206] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Michigan\n | December 15, 2019\n | University of Michigan | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[207] | No\n |\n| ![](image) Pennsylvania\n | May 17, 2021\n | University of Pennsylvania | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[208] | No\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(May 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Memberships and fellowships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Location\n | Date\n | Organization\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Massachusetts\n | 1999–2010\n | National Bureau of Economic Research | Research Associate (Monetary Economics)[209] |\n| ![](image) Massachusetts\n | 2001–present\n | American Academy of Arts and Sciences | Member[210] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | 2002–2010\n | Economists for Peace and Security | Trustee[211] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | 2005–present\n | Council on Foreign Relations | Member[25] |\n| ![](image) District of Columbia\n | 2009–present\n | Group of Thirty | Senior Member[212] |\n| ![](image) Tennessee\n | 2012–present\n | American Economic Association | Distinguished Fellow[213] |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | 2014–present\n | Econometric Society | Fellow[214] |\n| ![](image) District of Columbia\n | 2010–present\n | National Association for Business Economics | NABE Fellow[215] |\n| ![](image) England\n | 2016–present\n | British Academy | Honorary Fellow[216] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Location\n | Date\n | Organisation\n | Award\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Connecticut\n | May 26, 1997\n | Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | Wilbur Cross Medal[217] |\n| ![](image) District of Columbia\n | October 11, 2010\n | National Association for Business Economics | Adam Smith Award[218] |\n| ![](image) New York\n | January 22, 2015\n | Hobart and William Smith Colleges | Elizabeth Blackwell Award[219] |\n| ![](image) Massachusetts\n | May 27, 2016\n | Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study | Radcliffe Medal[220] |\n| ![](image) Rhode Island\n | May 5, 2017\n | Brown University | The President's Medal[221] |\n| ![](image) Illinois\n | November 7, 2017\n | *Institute of Government and Public Affairs* | The Paul H.

Ellis endowed *The Janet L. Yellen Chair* at the Yale School of Management, which was named after her. Professor Andrew Metrick has been invested as the inaugural *Janet L. Yellen Professor of Finance and Management* at the School.[227]\n* In December 2018, *Federal Reserve Board* presented an annual *Janet L. Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development* to recognize the exemplary work of Federal Reserve System staff, intended to honor former chair Yellen's commitment to public service.[228] Ariel Cisneros of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has been named the first recipient of the newly created award.[229]\n* Yellen has been named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by *Time* magazine four times. This occurred in the years 2014,[230] 2015,[231] 2017,[232] and 2023.[233] Additionally, she was named a runner-up for *Time* Person of the Year in 2022.[234]\n* Yellen has been ranked on multiple occasions in *Forbes* magazine's list of the world's 100 most powerful women. She was named the second-most powerful woman in the world in 2014.[235] *Forbes* also ranked her several times on its list of the world's most powerful people. She was named the sixth-most powerful person in the world in 2014 and 2016.[236]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nYellen is married to George Akerlof, an economist who is a university professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and Koshland Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as a 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate.[22][237] The couple met in the fall of 1977, became engaged by that December, and married in June 1978, less than a year after meeting.[238][21] Their son, Robert Akerlof (born 1981), is a fellow economist. He received a bachelor's *summa cum laude* in economics and mathematics from Yale University and earned his PhD in economics from Harvard University, where he was a Presidential Scholar. Robert is an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick.[239]\n\n\nYellen and Akerlof have often collaborated on research, including topics such as poverty, unemployment and a paper on the costs of out-of-wedlock childbearing. One of their most discussed papers at Berkeley, on why lower wages sometimes lead to lower employment, came from the personal experience of hiring a nanny for the first time.[238] Yellen says Akerlof has been her biggest intellectual influence.[238] Both frequently state that their lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than he is.[21][22]\n\n\nYellen has an estimated net worth of $20 million, accrued from stock holdings, speaking engagements, and various government and academic positions.[240] Upon taking office as U.S. Treasury Secretary, she divested her shares including those in Pfizer, ConocoPhillips, and AT&T, among others.[241]\n\n\nYellen inherited from her mother a collection of postage stamps worth between $15,000 and $50,000.[242][115] She doesn't collect them on her own.[243]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n\"Who's Yellen Now?\" is a song by Dessa, a member of the indie hip-hop collective Doomtree and contributor to *The Hamilton Mixtape*. *Marketplace* commissioned the song after then-President-elect Biden announced his intention to nominate Yellen as the nation's first female Treasury Secretary and joked that Lin-Manuel Miranda should write a Hamiltonesque musical about her.[244] In addition, *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert* premiered a parody of Hamilton's opening song about Yellen.[245]\n\n\nOn NBC's sketch comedy show *Saturday Night Live* (SNL), Yellen has been parodied by SNL cast member Kate McKinnon in 2021.[246]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Akerlof, George A.; Yellen, Janet L., eds.

He was the first African American to hold each of these positions.[2] After retiring from the armed services Austin joined the boards of Raytheon Technologies, Nucor, Tenet Healthcare, and Auburn University.[3][4] On December 7, 2020, he was nominated for defense secretary by then-President-elect Joe Biden. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 22, 2021, by a vote of 93–2.[5]\n\n\nAustin holds the unique distinction of having commanded in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan at the one-, two-, three- and four-star levels, and was the first African American to command a division, corps, and field army in combat. He is a recipient of the Silver Star, the nation's third highest award for valor, for his actions during the Iraq invasion, as well as five Defense Distinguished Service Medals.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAustin was born on August 8, 1953, in Mobile, Alabama;[3] he was raised in Thomasville, Georgia.[7] He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975.[8][9] While at the Academy, Austin played rugby and ran track.[10] He later earned a Master of Arts degree in counselor education from Auburn University's College of Education in 1986, and a Master of Business Administration in business management from Webster University in 1989. He is a graduate of the Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, the Army Command and General Staff College, and the Army War College.[9]\n\n\n\n## Military career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colonel Lloyd Austin in 1998In June 1975, Austin graduated from West Point and was commissioned in the Infantry as a second lieutenant.[9] He completed Airborne and Ranger schools prior to receiving his initial assignment in Germany with the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) as a rifle platoon leader and later as a scout platoon leader and company executive officer in 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry.[9][11]\n\n\nFollowing this assignment and attendance at the Infantry Officer Advanced Course, he was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he commanded the Combat Support Company, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry and served as the Assistant S-3 (Operations) for 1st Brigade.[9]\nIn 1981, Austin was assigned to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he was the operations officer for the Army Indianapolis District Recruiting Command, and where he later commanded a company in the Army Recruiting Battalion. Upon conclusion of this assignment, he attended Auburn University, where he completed studies for a Master's in education. He then returned to the West Point as a company tactical officer.[9][12]\n\n\nAfter completion of the Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, he was assigned to the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), Fort Drum, New York, where he served as the S-3 (Operations) and later executive officer for the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry. He subsequently served as Executive Officer for 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain, and later Director of Plans, Training, Mobilization, and Security for Fort Drum.[9]\n\n\nIn 1993, Austin returned to the 82nd Airborne Division where he commanded the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry.[13] He later served as G-3 for the 82nd.\n\n\n\nFollowing graduation from Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, he returned to the 82nd Airborne Division for a third tour of duty there to command 3rd Brigade.[9]\n\n![](image)Austin in a meeting with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Lieutenant General David Barno, and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad in Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2003Shortly after brigade command, he served as Chief, Joint Operations Division, J-3, on the Joint Staff at The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. His next assignment, in 2001, was as Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver (ADC-M), 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Stewart, Georgia. As the ADC-M, he helped lead the division's invasion of Iraq in March 2003.[9] Leading the fight from the front, Austin traveled the 500 miles from Kuwait to Baghdad in his command and control vehicle. The division reached Baghdad and secured the city.[14][15] Austin was awarded a Silver Star, the nation's third highest award for valor, for his actions as commander during the invasion.[16]\n\n\n**Commanding General of 10th Mtn Division (Light) and CJTF-180 – Afghanistan**\n\n\nAustin served from September 2003 until August 2005 as Commanding General of 10th Mountain Division, with duty as Commander, Combined Joint Task Force 180, during the War in Afghanistan. He was the first African American to serve as a U.S. Army division commander in combat.[15] He subsequently served as Chief of Staff of US Central Command at MacDill AFB, in Tampa, Florida, from September 2005 until October 2006.[9]\n\n\n**Commanding General of Multi-National Corps – Iraq**\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin during the Iraq War on September 11, 2007\nOn December 8, 2006, Austin was promoted to Lieutenant General and assumed command of XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina.[17] In February 2008, Austin became the second highest ranking commander in Iraq, taking command of the Multi-National Corps – Iraq (MNC-I). As commander of MNC-I, he directed the operations of approximately 152,000 joint and coalition forces across all sectors of Iraq.[18] He was the first African American general officer to lead a corps-sized element in combat.[15] Austin assumed the mission during the period when the Surge forces were drawing down. He expertly oversaw the responsible transition of forces out of the country while ensuring that progress continued on the ground.[19]\n\n\nAustin handed over command of XVIII Corps to become Director of the Joint Staff in August 2009.[9] This promotion came at the direction of Admiral Michael Mullen, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While Director, Austin was told by Mullen to increase the diversity of the Joint Staff. Austin credited the appointment as having jumpstarted his later career, saying: \"People who might not have known Lloyd Austin began to know him.\"[7]\n\n\n\n### Commanding General of US Forces – Iraq[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Lloyd Austin, commander of United States Forces-Iraq with General James Mattis, commander of United States Central Command, during the United States Forces-Iraq end of mission ceremony on December 15, 2011. Both would later serve as Secretaries of Defense.On September 1, 2010 at a ceremony at Al-Faw Palace in Baghdad, Austin was promoted to the rank of General, becoming the Army's 200th four-star general officer and the sixth African American in the U.S. Army to achieve the top rank.[20] He subsequently assumed the role of Commanding General (CG) of United States Forces – Iraq (USF-I), becoming the first African American in history to command an entire theater of war.[20] He was preceded in the role by General Ray Odierno.[21][22] As CG, USF-I, Austin was the senior military commander in charge of all US and remaining coalition forces in Iraq.[23] Their mission was to advise, train, assist, and equip the Iraqi Armed Forces and the security agencies part of the Ministry of the Interior. As commander, Austin requested an additional troop presence in Iraq from 14,000 to 18,000.[24]\n\n\nAustin oversaw the transition from Operation Iraqi Freedom and combat operations to Operation New Dawn and stability operations focused on advising, assisting, and training the ISF.[25] He was extensively involved in the internal U.S. discussions and then negotiations with the Iraqi Government leading up to the signing of the Strategic Partnership Agreement.[26] Opposing total U.S. withdrawal, Austin preferred that the U.S. maintain about 10,000 troops in Iraq after 2011 and he approved staff planning for up to 20,000 remaining troops.[27][28]\n\n\nIn the absence of a new Status of Forces Agreement, President Barack Obama made the decision to retrograde all U.S. forces out of Iraq by the end of 2011.[29] Austin oversaw the entire operation, concurrently planning and executing the orderly drawdown and redeployment of approximately 50,000 service members. The U.S. command in Iraq formally cased its colors on December 15, 2011, at a reduced-sized BIAP complex, and Austin's speech there cited his division's seizure of the airport over eight years beforehand.[30] Austin, along with other members of the USF-I staff, departed Iraq on December 18, 2011.[31]\n\n\n\n### Army Vice Chief of Staff[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Austin was nominated to become Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army (VCSA).[32] He took office on January 31, 2012.[33] As VCSA, he managed the day-to-day administration of the Army's budget and headquarters staff. Under his direction, the Army took steps to reduce the incidence of suicide in the ranks.[34][35] He spearheaded the Army's efforts to increase awareness and improve treatment options for the \"invisible wounds\" of war, namely traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress.[36]\n\n\n\n### United States Central Command[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Lloyd Austin with President Barack Obama at MacDill Air Force Base, September 17, 2014Austin became the commander of CENTCOM on March 22, 2013, after being nominated by President Obama in late 2012.[37][38][39] Austin was preceded as CENTCOM Commander by General James Mattis, whom Austin would later succeed as Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, General Austin oversaw all United States troops deployed and major United States Military operations around the area of Middle-East and Central Asia and some parts of South Asia. The area of command consisted of 20 countries including Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Egypt and Lebanon.[40]\n\n\nHe directed the activities of our service component commands, one subordinate unified command (U.S. Forces-Afghanistan/Resolute Support Mission), two major subordinate multi-service commands, and several temporary task forces actively engaged in military operations. Austin oversaw more than 150,000 American and coalition forces involved in operations throughout the region.\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Austin routinely advised the President, the Secretary of Defense, and other national-level leadership on challenges afflicting the CENTCOM region, and directed U.S. and allied military response to multiple crises and operations. These included the explosive crisis and transition of power in Egypt (2013–14); the resurgence of Al Qaeda's affiliate in the Arabian Peninsula; the Huthi-led insurgency against the Hadi government and the civil war in Yemen; continued support for the operations in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups; malign activity by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Forces; and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Lloyd Austin with Lieutenant General Charles Q. Brown Jr. during the Air Forces Central Command change of command ceremony at Shaw Air Force Base, June 29, 2015.\n![](image)General Austin in 2016\nAs commander, after ISIL seized control of Mosul in June 2014, Austin oversaw the development and execution of the military campaign plan to counter ISIL in Iraq and Syria.[42][43] As of October 2014, Austin argued that the U.S. military's primary focus in operations against ISIL should be Iraq, as opposed to Syria.[44] In 2015, Austin conceded in a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing that a CENTCOM-developed U.S. program intended to train Syrians to combat ISIL had resulted in only a handful of fighters.[45][46] At the hearing, he faced particularly pointed questioning from Senator John McCain over the direction of military engagement in Syria.[47]\n\n\nAustin's retirement ceremony took place at Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall on April 5, 2016.[48] During his departure and retirement ceremony, General Austin said that he was extremely proud of the achievements of the troops under his command. He said \"I'm very proud to have had the opportunity to lead troops in combat, I have seen our young leaders do amazing things in really tough and dangerous situations.\"[40]\n\n\n\n## Private sector[edit]\n\n\nImmediately after retiring as CENTCOM Commander, Austin joined the board of Raytheon Technologies, a military contractor, in April 2016.[49][50] As of October 2020[update], his Raytheon stock holdings were worth roughly $500,000 and his compensation, including stock, totaled $2.7 million.[49] On September 18, 2017, he was appointed to Nucor's board of directors.[51] On May 29, 2018, Austin was appointed as an independent director on the board of Tenet Healthcare.[52] He also operates a consulting firm and has been a partner at Pine Island Capital, an investment company with which Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Michèle Flournoy are affiliated.[53][49]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Defense (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Austin being sworn in as Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon on January 22, 2021\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn December 7, 2020, it was reported that President-elect Joe Biden would nominate Austin as Secretary of Defense.[53][54] \nAustin had a close relationship with Beau, Biden's late son, when he served on Austin's staff in Iraq in 2008 and 2009. Austin and Beau kept in touch with each other after Beau returned from his deployment.[55][56] Biden became acquainted with Austin while Austin was CENTCOM commander in the Obama administration, and reportedly grew to trust Austin after receiving Austin's briefings.[57] Like former defense secretary James Mattis,[58] Austin required a congressional waiver of the National Security Act of 1947 to bypass the seven-year waiting period after leaving active-duty military, as prescribed by 10 U.S.C. § 113(a), in order to be appointed as Secretary of Defense.[57] Austin's nomination, and the attendant requirement for a waiver, met with some concern in Congress regarding its implications for civil–military relations.[59][60] Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, among others, issued statements supporting Austin's nomination.[61]\n\n\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee held a confirmation hearing for Austin on January 19, 2021.[62] On January 21, Congress granted Austin a waiver of the seven-year requirement by a 326–78 vote in the House and a 69–27 vote in the Senate.[63][64] He was confirmed by the Senate in a 93–2 vote on January 22, 2021.[65] Republican senators Josh Hawley and Mike Lee were the only \"no\" votes. Upon his confirmation and swearing-in later that day, Austin became the first black secretary of defense.[66] Austin took office on January 22, 2021, after being sworn in by a Defense Department official, and was sworn in ceremonially by Vice President Kamala Harris on January 25, 2021.[67]\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with U.S. President Joe Biden at The Pentagon on February 10, 2021.\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nUpon assuming the office, Austin announced his top three priorities for the Defense Department in a memorandum issued to all DoD employees. It stated in part, \"As the Secretary of Defense, I am committed to ensuring that the Department develops the right people, priorities, and purpose of mission to continue to defend our Nation from enemies foreign and domestic. This will require aligning our priorities and capabilities to a changing and dynamic threat landscape. We will do so in a way that is based on a sober assessment of our strategic needs and recognize the importance of building and sustaining a strong workforce and unity within our Department, across the Nation and with our allies and partners around the world. Three priorities - defending the Nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork - will guide our efforts.\"[68]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2023, Austin testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on DoD's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 and the Future Years Defense Program. In his opening statement he reiterated the objectives of the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS):\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto in Manama, Bahrain on November 20, 2021\n\"The NDS directs the Department to act urgently to sustain and strengthen U.S. deterrence, with the [People's Republic of China] as our pacing challenge. The NDS also directs the Department to tackle the acute threat of Russia, as well as the persistent threats from Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and global terrorist groups. The NDS clearly articulates our priorities: defend the homeland from the growing, multi-domain challenge posed by the PRC; deter strategic attacks against the United States, our Allies, and our Partners; deter aggression, while preparing to prevail in conflict if necessary, by prioritizing the PRC challenge in the Indo-Pacific, followed by the Russian challenge in Europe; and build a resilient Joint Force and defense ecosystem.\"[69]\n\n\n\nSeveral days after assuming office as Secretary of Defense, Austin visited the National Guard deployed to Washington D.C. Austin praised the Guard for protecting the Capitol in the days after the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol.[70] During a press conference, he confirmed that the National Guard was expected to leave the U.S. Capitol within weeks and that there would be no further requests from federal authorities or lawmakers to keep the National Guard's troops in the Capitol complex following their March departure.[71] Austin would subsequently order the troops stay through May.[72]\n\n![](image)Austin speaks to Department of Defense personnel in 2021Part of Austin's primary agenda as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense's plan—in coordination with Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the president—to confront the COVID-19 pandemic within the department. Austin's first step was to urge service members to get vaccinated, especially after the revelation that almost one-third of active-duty service members had turned down the opportunity to get administered the vaccine.[73] In order to tout the safety of the coronavirus vaccine, Austin took the vaccine himself and also emphasized that taking the coronavirus vaccine will prevent disease among the troops, particularly those who were deployed overseas.[74] On February 19, 2021, Austin directed his staff to gather more information about a viral TikTok video from a female Marine regarding a sexual misconduct case.[75]\n\n\nAmong his early acts as Secretary of Defense, Austin removed former president Trump's appointees from the Pentagon advisory boards. As part of a review, he ordered their resignations, most notably former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Many of those removed were last minute political appointees after the 2020 election.[76]\n\n\n\n### Extremism in the ranks[edit]\n\n\nConcerns of possible right-wing extremism among the troops caused Austin to implement new training requirements. On February 5, 2021, Austin announced that all members of the United States military would be required to stand down within the next 60 days in order to conduct training. The training includes the importance of the oath of office, a review of impermissible behaviors, and procedures for reporting suspected or actual extremist behavior.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, March 9, 2023\n### Middle East[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen\n\nThroughout his tenure, Austin has engaged with civil and military leaders in the Middle East, reinforcing the United States' commitment to partnerships and security in the region. Areas for collaboration between the U.S. and allies include integrated air and missile defense, maritime security, intelligence sharing and early warning systems.[80]\n\n\nThere are more than 30,000 U.S. troops in the Middle East, despite the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan and significant drawdown in Iraq.[80]\n\n\nAt the AIPAC Political Leadership Forum in January 2023, Austin stated: \"Our network of alliances and partnerships is one of America's core strategic strengths. And no other country on Earth has anything like it. And that's especially important in today's Middle East.\"[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the Presidential Palace in Cairo, March 8, 2023\nDuring a speech delivered at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain in November 2021, Austin said: \"We do crucial work together with our friends in this [Middle East] region—to deter aggression from any quarter, to disrupt terrorist networks, and to maintain freedom of navigation in some of the world's most important waterways. And over the decades, we have worked side-by-side as you invested in the capabilities to defend yourselves. We've supported you along the way, and we're going to keep doing so. Our forces train together, plan together, and work together—and that makes us stronger together.\"[82]\n\n\nHe went on to say: \"So we're going to build on our longstanding investments in this crucial region—in security cooperation, and training, and professional military education, capacity building, and intelligence sharing, and joint exercises. It is a core part of my mission as Secretary of Defense to deepen and widen our partnerships.\"[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Turkish Defense Minister Yaşar Güler at NATO headquarters in Brussels, June 16, 2023\nOn July 16, 2022, President Biden met in Jeddah with the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – the Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Iraq, and the Kingdom of Jordan (together known as the GCC+3) for the first of its kind \"Jeddah Security and Development Summit\". At the Summit, Biden reiterated the importance the United States places on its decades-long strategic partnerships in the Middle East region, affirmed the U.S.' enduring commitment to the security and territorial defense of U.S. partners, and recognized the region's increasingly important role as a trade and technology crossroads between hemispheres. He also strongly affirmed the centrality of the Middle East region to the long-term security and prosperity of the United States and the American people.[84]\n\n\n\n### Iran[edit]\n\n\nDuring a visit to Israel in March 2023, in a joint press conference with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Austin said: \"Iran remains the primary driver of instability in the region and we remain deeply concerned by Iran's support for terrorism, its dangerous proxies, its nuclear advances, its aggression at sea, its cyber threats, and its proliferation of attack drones and advanced conventional weapons.\"[85]\n\n\nAt the AIPAC Political Leadership Forum on January 10, 2023, Austin stated: \"Going back to my days at CENTCOM, I have consistently said that the greatest threat to Israeli security, and to the region, is the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. We fully understand the dangers of the Iranian government's destabilizing actions—including its support for terrorism, its dangerous proxies, and its threats to wipe Israel off the map. But Iran is also stoking instability across the region—including its support for terrorists and militias, its proliferation of drones, its menacing cyber activities, its maritime aggression, and its continued threats against foreign officials. So Iran's reckless actions don't just threaten Israel. They endanger the entire Middle East and beyond, including by supporting Russia's cruel targeting of civilians in Ukraine. And increasingly, U.S. partners understand the importance of a regional approach to this kind of shared danger. So we're working closely with Israel, our partners in the Middle East, and our allies and partners to impose coordinated pressure on the Iranian regime.\"[81]\n\n\nOn February 19, 2021, Austin spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying that \"We discussed the continued commitment to the 70-year US-Saudi security partnership, and I'm looking forward to working together to achieve regional security and stability.\" Austin expressed support for Saudi Arabia in the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict.[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hosts Saudi prince Khalid bin Salman at the Pentagon, July 6, 2021\nOn February 25, 2021, under Biden's direction, Austin coordinated military defensive airstrikes against an Iranian-backed militia in Syria. Austin had previously recommended such airstrikes as a response to Iranian attacks on Americans in Iraq earlier in the month. It was also believed that the militia is responsible for killing a civilian contractor and injuring one American soldier as well as other troops in a missile attack on February 15, 2021.[87][88]\n\n\n\n### Combatting terrorism[edit]\n\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 28, 2023, Austin stated that, \"ISIS, al-Qa'ida, and other terrorist groups continue to threaten the security of the United States, our citizens, and our Partners in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. We are investing in a modernized, over-the-horizon counterterrorism architecture to prevent future attacks on our citizens and the U.S. homeland, and we have proven our continued ability to remove the most threatening al-Qa'ida and ISIS operatives from the battlefield.\"[89]\n\n\n\n### Israel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lloyd with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 13, 2023\n\"America's commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. It is not negotiable. And it never will be.\"[81]\n\n\nIn January 2023, the U.S. and Israel conducted the largest U.S.-Israel partnered exercise in history: Juniper Oak 23.2. The exercise integrated unmanned aerial vehicles, strategic bombers, jet fighters and precision fires. U.S. and Israeli forces conducted long-range strikes, suppression of enemy air defense, electronic attacks, offensive counter and air interdiction, and air operations in the maritime domain. More than 7,000 personnel participated in the all-domain exercise.[90]\n\n\nOn October 8, 2023, the day after the Hamas attack on Israel, Lloyd Austin directed *Gerald R. Ford* carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean in response. Along with the carrier, the group also includes the cruiser *Normandy*, and the destroyers *Ramage*, *Carney*, *Roosevelt* and *Thomas Hudner*.[91] On October 13, 2023, he arrived in Israel and met with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Austin said: \"I am here in person to make something crystal-clear: America’s support for Israel is ironclad.\"[92]\n\n\n\n### Indo-Pacific[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with Commander of U.S. Forces Japan Lt. Gen. Kevin Schneider at Yokota Air Force Base in Japan.In his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on March 29, 2023, Austin said: \"The PRC is our pacing challenge. And we're driving hard to meet it. Our budget builds on our previous investments to deter aggression. We're investing in a more resilient force posture in the Indo-Pacific and increasing the scale and the scope of our exercises with our partners.\n\n\nAnd in recent months, our friends in the Indo-Pacific have taken major steps forward. The Philippines has agreed to nearly double the number of sites where we cooperate together. Japan has committed to double its defense spending. And through the historic AUKUS partnership, we'll work with our Australian and British allies to build game-changing defense advantages that will deter aggression and boost our defense industrial capacity.\"[93]\n\n\nIn March 2021, as part of their first overseas trip as members of the Biden administration, Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Japan and South Korea.[94] The trip reflected the Biden administration's concerns about China's growing influence within the Indo-Pacific region, especially their military buildup during the pandemic, as well North Korea's nuclear threat and the February 2021 coup d'état in Myanmar.[95] The trip was also part of the Biden administration's \"America is back\" diplomatic theme, and Austin pledged the U.S.'s commitment to reaffirm ties with its allies and to maintain a robust military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.[94] Austin added that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remains a top priority for the Biden Administration, and that the alliances with South Korea and Japan are among the most important tools the United States has in that regard.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin meets with Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, Vietnam, July 29, 2021\nOn March 16, 2021, the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (SCC) (Japan-U.S. \"2+2\") was convened in Tokyo. The meeting was attended by Austin and Blinken from the U.S. side, and Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu and Defense Minister Kishi Nobuo from the Japanese side. The four ministers reaffirmed that the Japan-U.S. Alliance remains the \"cornerstone\" of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, and renewed the unwavering commitment of both countries to the Japan-U.S. Alliance.[97]\n\n\nIn June 2023, as part of his seventh official visit to the Indo-Pacific region, Austin traveled to Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada and other senior leaders, including Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi. Austin's visit comes as the United States and Japan take important strides to modernize Alliance capabilities, optimize U.S. force posture, and build links with like-minded partners following the historic U.S.-Japan \"2+2\" Ministerial meeting earlier this year.[98]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Austin traveled to Australia where he participated in the 33rd Australia/U.S. ministerial consultations, also called AUSMIN. Following the meeting, DoD officials stated, \"the unbreakable alliance between the United States and Australia has never been stronger\" and \"it is doing more than ever for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.\"[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos at the Pentagon, May 3, 2023\nIn March 2021, Austin also made a three-day visit to India, where he met with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh, and other senior government officials.[100] India drew closer to the United States following its tensions with China on their disputed Sino-Indian border. Austin urged India to cancel the planned purchase of Russia's S-400 air defence system.[101]\n\n\nAustin made a second visit to India in June 2023, where he again met with Defense Minister Rajnath Singh as well as other senior leaders to discuss the ongoing joint efforts to modernize the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership.[98]\n\n\nThe India-U.S. defense partnership has strengthened considerably in the last few years with the countries signing key defense and security pacts, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement in 2016 that allows their militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Chinese State councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, November 22, 2022\nDuring a press conference following Austin's visit to New Delhi, a senior Defense Department official described the progress between the U.S. and India: \"India's growing commitment to playing a more engaged international role, including in the Indo-Pacific Quad, demonstrates a new and growing willingness to join the United States to protect and advance a shared vision of a free, open and rules-based global order.[103]\n\n\nOn June 11, 2022, Austin condemned China's \"provocative, destabilising\" military activity near Taiwan,[104] a day after China's Defence Minister Wei Fenghe warned Austin that \"if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will definitely not hesitate to start a war no matter the cost.\"[105] Austin said the United States \"will continue to fulfill our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act. That includes assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.\"[106] By February 2023, he had secured the U.S. military access to nine military bases in the Philippines, which is orthogonally situated between Taiwan and the South China Sea, expediting the full implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement signed during the Obama administration.[107] At the June 2023 Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Austin warned that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would be devastating.[108]\n\n\n\n### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Austin meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on June 25, 2021\nOn February 19, 2021, Austin told reporters at the Pentagon that the Biden Administration had not yet determined whether the U.S. would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the May 1 deadline set by the Trump administration in February 2020 as part of the Doha Agreement, a deal reached between the United States and the Taliban.[109] The Biden administration was considering a six-month extension.[110] Austin promised that the United States \"will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"[111] On March 21, 2021, Austin met with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul.[112]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Biden directed his national security team, including Austin, to begin withdrawal planning that accounted for a range of possible contingencies, including a non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO).[113] On April 14, 2021, in an address to the nation, President Biden announced that a new deadline for full withdrawal of all U.S. troops had been set for September 11, 2021. \"After consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, as well as with [Afghan President Ashraf Ghani] and many others around the world, I concluded that it's time to end America's longest war. It's time for American troops to come home,\" he said.[114]\n\n\nSoon after the withdrawal of U.S. troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces.[115][116] On July 24, 2021, Austin said: \"In terms of whether or not [Afghanistan's military] will stop the Taliban, I think the first thing to do is to make sure that they can slow the momentum.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with NATO's Resolute Support Mission commander Austin S. Miller in Kabul, Afghanistan, March 2021\nOn August 12, 2021, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden Administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to Kabul Airport to evacuate embassy personnel, US nationals and Special Immigrant Visa applicants.[118] Over the next few weeks, the Defense Department oversaw one of the largest airlifts in history, evacuating more than 120,000 Americans, Afghans and people of other nationalities.[119] Tragically, on August 26, 2021, an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a suicide bomb at Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing more than 170 civilians and 13 US service members.[120] In a statement issued on the one-year anniversary of that devastating attack at Abbey Gate, Austin said: \"The heroes we lost that day gave their lives to defend their teammates and to help save the lives of tens of thousands of innocent Afghan people who sought freedom and the opportunity for a better life.\"[121] On August 30, 2021, the last American service member left Afghanistan.[122]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Austin directed an independent After Action Review (AAR) be conducted to provide a detailed assessment of the Defense Department's implementation of US Afghanistan policy from January 2020 through August 2021. \"The purpose of the AAR was to examine decision points, constraints, and assumptions in order to contribute toward a whole-of-government effort to learn, improve and incorporate lessons learned into the Department's response to future crises.\"[123]\n\n\n\n### War in Ukraine[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Russia–United States relations and 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n![](image)Austin stated, \"I will always prioritize the protection of US military personnel in anything that we do.\"[124]\nDuring the Russian war against Ukraine, the U.S. sent tens of billions of dollars in missiles, ammunition and other items to Ukraine.[125] Austin said that he wanted to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\".[126] The *New York Times* reported that U.S. military may be providing real-time battlefield targeting intelligence to Ukraine.[127][128][129] Austin said he \"does not\" believe that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will result in a nuclear war.[130]\n\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine, stating the \"special military operation\" is aimed at \"demilitarization\" and \"denazification\" of the country to protect ethnic Russians, prevent Kyiv's NATO membership and to keep it in Russia's \"sphere of influence\".[131]\n\n\nAustin immediately ordered deployment of 7,000 U.S. military personnel and key enablers to locations across Europe in support of Ukraine. The next day, the NATO Response Force was activated,[132] and the Biden administration authorized $350 million in military assistance from Defense Department inventories, including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment.[133]\n\n\nIn March 2022, the Biden administration announced $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including direct transfers of Defense Department equipment to the Ukrainian military. In total, the United States has committed more than $44.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden Administration, including $43.9 billion since the beginning of Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion on February 24, 2022.[134]\n\n\nOn April 24, 2022, Secretary Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv, Ukraine, and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian leaders. They discussed America's stalwart support for the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people, including through the U.S.' significant assistance to Ukraine's security, governance, economic and humanitarian needs.[135]\n\n\nOn April 26, 2022, Austin hosted a forum at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, where nearly 40 nations met to discuss current and future efforts to provide support for Ukraine. In his opening comments he articulated the purpose of the gathering, \"to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia's unjust invasion—and to build up Ukraine's defenses for tomorrow's challenges.\" Austin also made clear that the invasion of Ukraine was a \"war of choice\". \"Nobody is fooled by Putin's pretexts or by his phony claims on the Donbas [region],\" Austin said. \"Let's be clear — Russia's invasion is indefensible, and so are Russian atrocities. We all start today from a position of moral clarity: Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man.\"[136]\n\n\n\"Russia's invasion is baseless, reckless and lawless,\" Austin said. \"It is an affront to the rules-based international order. It is a challenge to free people everywhere. And, as we see this morning, nations of goodwill from around the world stand united in our resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's imperial aggression. And that's the way it should be.\" \"The contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to intensify our efforts, coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning today's fight and the struggles to come. The monthly meetings may be in-person, virtual or mixed. And they'll extend the transparency, the integration, and the dialogue that we saw today.\"[137]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on April 24, 2022\nOn January 20, 2023, Austin traveled to Ramstein Air Base, Germany to conduct the eighth such meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). He was joined by ministers of defense and chiefs of defense from nearly 50 nations, including Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.[138] The meeting produced an unprecedented level of donations from allies and partners,[139] including the procurement of 31 M1 Abrams tanks for Ukraine by the U.S.[140] as part of a $400 million Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package.[141] On May 15, 2023, the Defense Department announced the arrival of the Abrams tanks to Grafenwoehr, Germany in preparation for U.S.-led training of Ukrainian tank crews and maintainers before the tanks are sent to the front lines to arm Ukrainian forces.[142]\n\n\nDuring a May 2023 Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hearing about the Department of Defense's (DoD) Fiscal Year 2024 budget request, Senator Dick Durbin asked Austin: \"Why are you reluctant to share [with the International Criminal Court] the evidence that we have gathered in the United States through the Department of Defense for those who are holding [Russian President] Vladimir Putin accountable for his war crimes?\" Austin responded, \"The Department firmly supports the goal of holding Russia accountable for its violations in Ukraine.\" But he added, \"I will always prioritize the protection of US military personnel in anything that we do.\" When Durbin pushed him for further clarification, Austin said, \"Again, I do have concerns about reciprocity [against U.S. military personnel] going forward.\"[124][143][144]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2023, Austin hosted the 12th meeting of the UDCG, this one held virtually and attended by leaders from 50 countries.[145] Austin told those gathered, \"Today, we committed to doing even more to support Ukraine's fight for freedom. I came away from today's meeting as confident as ever in the contact group's resolve and sustained unity.\"[146]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2023, Austin delivered remarks at the 13th meeting of the UDCG, marking the United States' new package of more than $2 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.[147] On July 17, 2023, he spoke at the 14th meeting of the UDCG, noting that \"Russia's war of choice has now lasted more than 500 days.[148] On September 19, 2023, at the 15th meeting of the UDCG, Austin said: \"Back in June, President Biden joined the leaders of the G7 in a joint declaration condemning, and I quote, \"Russia's illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Those leaders committed to working together with Ukraine on long-term bilateral security commitments and arrangements to help secure its future.  Since June, more than 22 countries have signed on to this statement and they've started working to further deepen their support for Ukraine now and in the years to come.\"[149]\n\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has grown to include more than 54 countries – from North America to Europe to the Indo-Pacific – providing military assistance to help Ukraine. These nations also have committed: 1,000+ tanks and other armored vehicles, 800+ artillery systems, 2M+ rounds of artillery ammunition and 50+ advanced multiple rocket launching systems.[150] The group of nations has also trained thousands of Ukrainian service members in these new capabilities.[146]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Austin made his first trip to the Africa continent as Secretary of Defense. He started his tour in Djibouti, home to the primary U.S. military base on the African continent, where he met with Djiboutian leaders and Somalia’s president. He then traveled to Kenya, where he and his Kenyan counterpart signed a five-year security agreement to support working together against their common terror threat. Austin also pledged $100 million in support of Kenyan security deployments, as Kenya prepares to lead a multinational peacekeeping mission to Haiti to combat gang violence. He concluded his trip on Africa’s western coast, becoming the first U.S. defense secretary to ever visit Angola.[151]\n\n\nIn a speech delivered at the National Archives Auditorium in Luanda, Angola on September 27, Austin said: \n\n\n\"I'm here in Angola to strengthen that robust and equal partnership.  But I'm also here to underscore an important point, and that is that Africa matters. It matters profoundly to the shape of the 21st Century world.  And it matters for our common prosperity and our shared security.\"[152]\n\n\nHe went on to say: \"We know that the walk to freedom can be long, and no one gets it right all of the time.  You know, I love my country so much that I fought for it, but America isn't trying to cover up for our imperfections.  When a democracy falls short, when it falls short of its best traditions, as we all sometimes do, the whole world gets to see it.  But that's not the point.  The genius of a democracy is not that it's perfect.  The genius of a democracy is that it can always open up space to let its citizen strive to live the universal values of freedom and self-government and human rights.\n\n\nAnd the genius of a democracy is that it is always a work in progress, and that's personal for me.  I am a child of America's segregated South.  I grew up in a time of legalized and racist segregation in America, and I stand here today in Africa as America's first black secretary of defense.\"[153]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nAustin was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother and remains practicing himself.[154][155]\n\n\nAustin and his wife, Charlene Denise Banner Austin, have been married for over forty years.[3][156] Charlene worked as a non-profit administrator and served on the board of the Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University.[157] Austin has two stepsons.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Awards and decorations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The XVIII Airborne Corps command group returns home from Operation Iraqi Freedom in April 2009;

He was the first African American to hold each of these positions.[2] After retiring from the armed services Austin joined the boards of Raytheon Technologies, Nucor, Tenet Healthcare, and Auburn University.[3][4] On December 7, 2020, he was nominated for defense secretary by then-President-elect Joe Biden. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 22, 2021, by a vote of 93–2.[5]\n\n\nAustin holds the unique distinction of having commanded in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan at the one-, two-, three- and four-star levels, and was the first African American to command a division, corps, and field army in combat. He is a recipient of the Silver Star, the nation's third highest award for valor, for his actions during the Iraq invasion, as well as five Defense Distinguished Service Medals.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAustin was born on August 8, 1953, in Mobile, Alabama;[3] he was raised in Thomasville, Georgia.[7] He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1975.[8][9] While at the Academy, Austin played rugby and ran track.[10] He later earned a Master of Arts degree in counselor education from Auburn University's College of Education in 1986, and a Master of Business Administration in business management from Webster University in 1989. He is a graduate of the Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced courses, the Army Command and General Staff College, and the Army War College.[9]\n\n\n\n## Military career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colonel Lloyd Austin in 1998In June 1975, Austin graduated from West Point and was commissioned in the Infantry as a second lieutenant.[9] He completed Airborne and Ranger schools prior to receiving his initial assignment in Germany with the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized) as a rifle platoon leader and later as a scout platoon leader and company executive officer in 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry.[9][11]\n\n\nFollowing this assignment and attendance at the Infantry Officer Advanced Course, he was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where he commanded the Combat Support Company, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 508th Infantry and served as the Assistant S-3 (Operations) for 1st Brigade.[9]\nIn 1981, Austin was assigned to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he was the operations officer for the Army Indianapolis District Recruiting Command, and where he later commanded a company in the Army Recruiting Battalion. Upon conclusion of this assignment, he attended Auburn University, where he completed studies for a Master's in education. He then returned to the West Point as a company tactical officer.[9][12]\n\n\nAfter completion of the Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, he was assigned to the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry), Fort Drum, New York, where he served as the S-3 (Operations) and later executive officer for the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry. He subsequently served as Executive Officer for 1st Brigade, 10th Mountain, and later Director of Plans, Training, Mobilization, and Security for Fort Drum.[9]\n\n\nIn 1993, Austin returned to the 82nd Airborne Division where he commanded the 2d Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry.[13] He later served as G-3 for the 82nd.\n\n\n\nFollowing graduation from Army War College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, he returned to the 82nd Airborne Division for a third tour of duty there to command 3rd Brigade.[9]\n\n![](image)Austin in a meeting with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Lieutenant General David Barno, and U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad in Kandahar, Afghanistan in 2003Shortly after brigade command, he served as Chief, Joint Operations Division, J-3, on the Joint Staff at The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. His next assignment, in 2001, was as Assistant Division Commander for Maneuver (ADC-M), 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized), Fort Stewart, Georgia. As the ADC-M, he helped lead the division's invasion of Iraq in March 2003.[9] Leading the fight from the front, Austin traveled the 500 miles from Kuwait to Baghdad in his command and control vehicle. The division reached Baghdad and secured the city.[14][15] Austin was awarded a Silver Star, the nation's third highest award for valor, for his actions as commander during the invasion.[16]\n\n\n**Commanding General of 10th Mtn Division (Light) and CJTF-180 – Afghanistan**\n\n\nAustin served from September 2003 until August 2005 as Commanding General of 10th Mountain Division, with duty as Commander, Combined Joint Task Force 180, during the War in Afghanistan. He was the first African American to serve as a U.S. Army division commander in combat.[15] He subsequently served as Chief of Staff of US Central Command at MacDill AFB, in Tampa, Florida, from September 2005 until October 2006.[9]\n\n\n**Commanding General of Multi-National Corps – Iraq**\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin during the Iraq War on September 11, 2007\nOn December 8, 2006, Austin was promoted to Lieutenant General and assumed command of XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina.[17] In February 2008, Austin became the second highest ranking commander in Iraq, taking command of the Multi-National Corps – Iraq (MNC-I). As commander of MNC-I, he directed the operations of approximately 152,000 joint and coalition forces across all sectors of Iraq.[18] He was the first African American general officer to lead a corps-sized element in combat.[15] Austin assumed the mission during the period when the Surge forces were drawing down. He expertly oversaw the responsible transition of forces out of the country while ensuring that progress continued on the ground.[19]\n\n\nAustin handed over command of XVIII Corps to become Director of the Joint Staff in August 2009.[9] This promotion came at the direction of Admiral Michael Mullen, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While Director, Austin was told by Mullen to increase the diversity of the Joint Staff. Austin credited the appointment as having jumpstarted his later career, saying: \"People who might not have known Lloyd Austin began to know him.\"[7]\n\n\n\n### Commanding General of US Forces – Iraq[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Lloyd Austin, commander of United States Forces-Iraq with General James Mattis, commander of United States Central Command, during the United States Forces-Iraq end of mission ceremony on December 15, 2011. Both would later serve as Secretaries of Defense.On September 1, 2010 at a ceremony at Al-Faw Palace in Baghdad, Austin was promoted to the rank of General, becoming the Army's 200th four-star general officer and the sixth African American in the U.S. Army to achieve the top rank.[20] He subsequently assumed the role of Commanding General (CG) of United States Forces – Iraq (USF-I), becoming the first African American in history to command an entire theater of war.[20] He was preceded in the role by General Ray Odierno.[21][22] As CG, USF-I, Austin was the senior military commander in charge of all US and remaining coalition forces in Iraq.[23] Their mission was to advise, train, assist, and equip the Iraqi Armed Forces and the security agencies part of the Ministry of the Interior. As commander, Austin requested an additional troop presence in Iraq from 14,000 to 18,000.[24]\n\n\nAustin oversaw the transition from Operation Iraqi Freedom and combat operations to Operation New Dawn and stability operations focused on advising, assisting, and training the ISF.[25] He was extensively involved in the internal U.S. discussions and then negotiations with the Iraqi Government leading up to the signing of the Strategic Partnership Agreement.[26] Opposing total U.S. withdrawal, Austin preferred that the U.S. maintain about 10,000 troops in Iraq after 2011 and he approved staff planning for up to 20,000 remaining troops.[27][28]\n\n\nIn the absence of a new Status of Forces Agreement, President Barack Obama made the decision to retrograde all U.S. forces out of Iraq by the end of 2011.[29] Austin oversaw the entire operation, concurrently planning and executing the orderly drawdown and redeployment of approximately 50,000 service members. The U.S. command in Iraq formally cased its colors on December 15, 2011, at a reduced-sized BIAP complex, and Austin's speech there cited his division's seizure of the airport over eight years beforehand.[30] Austin, along with other members of the USF-I staff, departed Iraq on December 18, 2011.[31]\n\n\n\n### Army Vice Chief of Staff[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Austin was nominated to become Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army (VCSA).[32] He took office on January 31, 2012.[33] As VCSA, he managed the day-to-day administration of the Army's budget and headquarters staff. Under his direction, the Army took steps to reduce the incidence of suicide in the ranks.[34][35] He spearheaded the Army's efforts to increase awareness and improve treatment options for the \"invisible wounds\" of war, namely traumatic brain injuries and post-traumatic stress.[36]\n\n\n\n### United States Central Command[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Lloyd Austin with President Barack Obama at MacDill Air Force Base, September 17, 2014Austin became the commander of CENTCOM on March 22, 2013, after being nominated by President Obama in late 2012.[37][38][39] Austin was preceded as CENTCOM Commander by General James Mattis, whom Austin would later succeed as Secretary of Defense. In this capacity, General Austin oversaw all United States troops deployed and major United States Military operations around the area of Middle-East and Central Asia and some parts of South Asia. The area of command consisted of 20 countries including Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Egypt and Lebanon.[40]\n\n\nHe directed the activities of our service component commands, one subordinate unified command (U.S. Forces-Afghanistan/Resolute Support Mission), two major subordinate multi-service commands, and several temporary task forces actively engaged in military operations. Austin oversaw more than 150,000 American and coalition forces involved in operations throughout the region.\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Austin routinely advised the President, the Secretary of Defense, and other national-level leadership on challenges afflicting the CENTCOM region, and directed U.S. and allied military response to multiple crises and operations. These included the explosive crisis and transition of power in Egypt (2013–14); the resurgence of Al Qaeda's affiliate in the Arabian Peninsula; the Huthi-led insurgency against the Hadi government and the civil war in Yemen; continued support for the operations in Afghanistan against Al Qaeda and other extremist groups; malign activity by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Forces; and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq and Syria.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Lloyd Austin with Lieutenant General Charles Q. Brown Jr. during the Air Forces Central Command change of command ceremony at Shaw Air Force Base, June 29, 2015.\n![](image)General Austin in 2016\nAs commander, after ISIL seized control of Mosul in June 2014, Austin oversaw the development and execution of the military campaign plan to counter ISIL in Iraq and Syria.[42][43] As of October 2014, Austin argued that the U.S. military's primary focus in operations against ISIL should be Iraq, as opposed to Syria.[44] In 2015, Austin conceded in a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing that a CENTCOM-developed U.S. program intended to train Syrians to combat ISIL had resulted in only a handful of fighters.[45][46] At the hearing, he faced particularly pointed questioning from Senator John McCain over the direction of military engagement in Syria.[47]\n\n\nAustin's retirement ceremony took place at Joint Base Myer–Henderson Hall on April 5, 2016.[48] During his departure and retirement ceremony, General Austin said that he was extremely proud of the achievements of the troops under his command. He said \"I'm very proud to have had the opportunity to lead troops in combat, I have seen our young leaders do amazing things in really tough and dangerous situations.\"[40]\n\n\n\n## Private sector[edit]\n\n\nImmediately after retiring as CENTCOM Commander, Austin joined the board of Raytheon Technologies, a military contractor, in April 2016.[49][50] As of October 2020[update], his Raytheon stock holdings were worth roughly $500,000 and his compensation, including stock, totaled $2.7 million.[49] On September 18, 2017, he was appointed to Nucor's board of directors.[51] On May 29, 2018, Austin was appointed as an independent director on the board of Tenet Healthcare.[52] He also operates a consulting firm and has been a partner at Pine Island Capital, an investment company with which Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Michèle Flournoy are affiliated.[53][49]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Defense (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Austin being sworn in as Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon on January 22, 2021\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn December 7, 2020, it was reported that President-elect Joe Biden would nominate Austin as Secretary of Defense.[53][54] \nAustin had a close relationship with Beau, Biden's late son, when he served on Austin's staff in Iraq in 2008 and 2009. Austin and Beau kept in touch with each other after Beau returned from his deployment.[55][56] Biden became acquainted with Austin while Austin was CENTCOM commander in the Obama administration, and reportedly grew to trust Austin after receiving Austin's briefings.[57] Like former defense secretary James Mattis,[58] Austin required a congressional waiver of the National Security Act of 1947 to bypass the seven-year waiting period after leaving active-duty military, as prescribed by 10 U.S.C. § 113(a), in order to be appointed as Secretary of Defense.[57] Austin's nomination, and the attendant requirement for a waiver, met with some concern in Congress regarding its implications for civil–military relations.[59][60] Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, among others, issued statements supporting Austin's nomination.[61]\n\n\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee held a confirmation hearing for Austin on January 19, 2021.[62] On January 21, Congress granted Austin a waiver of the seven-year requirement by a 326–78 vote in the House and a 69–27 vote in the Senate.[63][64] He was confirmed by the Senate in a 93–2 vote on January 22, 2021.[65] Republican senators Josh Hawley and Mike Lee were the only \"no\" votes. Upon his confirmation and swearing-in later that day, Austin became the first black secretary of defense.[66] Austin took office on January 22, 2021, after being sworn in by a Defense Department official, and was sworn in ceremonially by Vice President Kamala Harris on January 25, 2021.[67]\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with U.S. President Joe Biden at The Pentagon on February 10, 2021.\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nUpon assuming the office, Austin announced his top three priorities for the Defense Department in a memorandum issued to all DoD employees. It stated in part, \"As the Secretary of Defense, I am committed to ensuring that the Department develops the right people, priorities, and purpose of mission to continue to defend our Nation from enemies foreign and domestic. This will require aligning our priorities and capabilities to a changing and dynamic threat landscape. We will do so in a way that is based on a sober assessment of our strategic needs and recognize the importance of building and sustaining a strong workforce and unity within our Department, across the Nation and with our allies and partners around the world. Three priorities - defending the Nation, taking care of our people, and succeeding through teamwork - will guide our efforts.\"[68]\n\n\nOn March 28, 2023, Austin testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on DoD's Budget Request for Fiscal Year 2024 and the Future Years Defense Program. In his opening statement he reiterated the objectives of the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS):\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Indonesian Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto in Manama, Bahrain on November 20, 2021\n\"The NDS directs the Department to act urgently to sustain and strengthen U.S. deterrence, with the [People's Republic of China] as our pacing challenge. The NDS also directs the Department to tackle the acute threat of Russia, as well as the persistent threats from Iran, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and global terrorist groups. The NDS clearly articulates our priorities: defend the homeland from the growing, multi-domain challenge posed by the PRC; deter strategic attacks against the United States, our Allies, and our Partners; deter aggression, while preparing to prevail in conflict if necessary, by prioritizing the PRC challenge in the Indo-Pacific, followed by the Russian challenge in Europe; and build a resilient Joint Force and defense ecosystem.\"[69]\n\n\n\nSeveral days after assuming office as Secretary of Defense, Austin visited the National Guard deployed to Washington D.C. Austin praised the Guard for protecting the Capitol in the days after the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol.[70] During a press conference, he confirmed that the National Guard was expected to leave the U.S. Capitol within weeks and that there would be no further requests from federal authorities or lawmakers to keep the National Guard's troops in the Capitol complex following their March departure.[71] Austin would subsequently order the troops stay through May.[72]\n\n![](image)Austin speaks to Department of Defense personnel in 2021Part of Austin's primary agenda as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense's plan—in coordination with Anthony Fauci, the chief medical advisor to the president—to confront the COVID-19 pandemic within the department. Austin's first step was to urge service members to get vaccinated, especially after the revelation that almost one-third of active-duty service members had turned down the opportunity to get administered the vaccine.[73] In order to tout the safety of the coronavirus vaccine, Austin took the vaccine himself and also emphasized that taking the coronavirus vaccine will prevent disease among the troops, particularly those who were deployed overseas.[74] On February 19, 2021, Austin directed his staff to gather more information about a viral TikTok video from a female Marine regarding a sexual misconduct case.[75]\n\n\nAmong his early acts as Secretary of Defense, Austin removed former president Trump's appointees from the Pentagon advisory boards. As part of a review, he ordered their resignations, most notably former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Many of those removed were last minute political appointees after the 2020 election.[76]\n\n\n\n### Extremism in the ranks[edit]\n\n\nConcerns of possible right-wing extremism among the troops caused Austin to implement new training requirements. On February 5, 2021, Austin announced that all members of the United States military would be required to stand down within the next 60 days in order to conduct training. The training includes the importance of the oath of office, a review of impermissible behaviors, and procedures for reporting suspected or actual extremist behavior.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, March 9, 2023\n### Middle East[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen\n\nThroughout his tenure, Austin has engaged with civil and military leaders in the Middle East, reinforcing the United States' commitment to partnerships and security in the region. Areas for collaboration between the U.S. and allies include integrated air and missile defense, maritime security, intelligence sharing and early warning systems.[80]\n\n\nThere are more than 30,000 U.S. troops in the Middle East, despite the United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan and significant drawdown in Iraq.[80]\n\n\nAt the AIPAC Political Leadership Forum in January 2023, Austin stated: \"Our network of alliances and partnerships is one of America's core strategic strengths. And no other country on Earth has anything like it. And that's especially important in today's Middle East.\"[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi at the Presidential Palace in Cairo, March 8, 2023\nDuring a speech delivered at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain in November 2021, Austin said: \"We do crucial work together with our friends in this [Middle East] region—to deter aggression from any quarter, to disrupt terrorist networks, and to maintain freedom of navigation in some of the world's most important waterways. And over the decades, we have worked side-by-side as you invested in the capabilities to defend yourselves. We've supported you along the way, and we're going to keep doing so. Our forces train together, plan together, and work together—and that makes us stronger together.\"[82]\n\n\nHe went on to say: \"So we're going to build on our longstanding investments in this crucial region—in security cooperation, and training, and professional military education, capacity building, and intelligence sharing, and joint exercises. It is a core part of my mission as Secretary of Defense to deepen and widen our partnerships.\"[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Turkish Defense Minister Yaşar Güler at NATO headquarters in Brussels, June 16, 2023\nOn July 16, 2022, President Biden met in Jeddah with the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – the Republic of Egypt, the Republic of Iraq, and the Kingdom of Jordan (together known as the GCC+3) for the first of its kind \"Jeddah Security and Development Summit\". At the Summit, Biden reiterated the importance the United States places on its decades-long strategic partnerships in the Middle East region, affirmed the U.S.' enduring commitment to the security and territorial defense of U.S. partners, and recognized the region's increasingly important role as a trade and technology crossroads between hemispheres. He also strongly affirmed the centrality of the Middle East region to the long-term security and prosperity of the United States and the American people.[84]\n\n\n\n### Iran[edit]\n\n\nDuring a visit to Israel in March 2023, in a joint press conference with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Austin said: \"Iran remains the primary driver of instability in the region and we remain deeply concerned by Iran's support for terrorism, its dangerous proxies, its nuclear advances, its aggression at sea, its cyber threats, and its proliferation of attack drones and advanced conventional weapons.\"[85]\n\n\nAt the AIPAC Political Leadership Forum on January 10, 2023, Austin stated: \"Going back to my days at CENTCOM, I have consistently said that the greatest threat to Israeli security, and to the region, is the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. We fully understand the dangers of the Iranian government's destabilizing actions—including its support for terrorism, its dangerous proxies, and its threats to wipe Israel off the map. But Iran is also stoking instability across the region—including its support for terrorists and militias, its proliferation of drones, its menacing cyber activities, its maritime aggression, and its continued threats against foreign officials. So Iran's reckless actions don't just threaten Israel. They endanger the entire Middle East and beyond, including by supporting Russia's cruel targeting of civilians in Ukraine. And increasingly, U.S. partners understand the importance of a regional approach to this kind of shared danger. So we're working closely with Israel, our partners in the Middle East, and our allies and partners to impose coordinated pressure on the Iranian regime.\"[81]\n\n\nOn February 19, 2021, Austin spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, saying that \"We discussed the continued commitment to the 70-year US-Saudi security partnership, and I'm looking forward to working together to achieve regional security and stability.\" Austin expressed support for Saudi Arabia in the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict.[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin hosts Saudi prince Khalid bin Salman at the Pentagon, July 6, 2021\nOn February 25, 2021, under Biden's direction, Austin coordinated military defensive airstrikes against an Iranian-backed militia in Syria. Austin had previously recommended such airstrikes as a response to Iranian attacks on Americans in Iraq earlier in the month. It was also believed that the militia is responsible for killing a civilian contractor and injuring one American soldier as well as other troops in a missile attack on February 15, 2021.[87][88]\n\n\n\n### Combatting terrorism[edit]\n\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 28, 2023, Austin stated that, \"ISIS, al-Qa'ida, and other terrorist groups continue to threaten the security of the United States, our citizens, and our Partners in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. We are investing in a modernized, over-the-horizon counterterrorism architecture to prevent future attacks on our citizens and the U.S. homeland, and we have proven our continued ability to remove the most threatening al-Qa'ida and ISIS operatives from the battlefield.\"[89]\n\n\n\n### Israel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lloyd with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 13, 2023\n\"America's commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. It is not negotiable. And it never will be.\"[81]\n\n\nIn January 2023, the U.S. and Israel conducted the largest U.S.-Israel partnered exercise in history: Juniper Oak 23.2. The exercise integrated unmanned aerial vehicles, strategic bombers, jet fighters and precision fires. U.S. and Israeli forces conducted long-range strikes, suppression of enemy air defense, electronic attacks, offensive counter and air interdiction, and air operations in the maritime domain. More than 7,000 personnel participated in the all-domain exercise.[90]\n\n\nOn October 8, 2023, the day after the Hamas attack on Israel, Lloyd Austin directed *Gerald R. Ford* carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean in response. Along with the carrier, the group also includes the cruiser *Normandy*, and the destroyers *Ramage*, *Carney*, *Roosevelt* and *Thomas Hudner*.[91] On October 13, 2023, he arrived in Israel and met with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Austin said: \"I am here in person to make something crystal-clear: America’s support for Israel is ironclad.\"[92]\n\n\n\n### Indo-Pacific[edit]\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin with Commander of U.S. Forces Japan Lt. Gen. Kevin Schneider at Yokota Air Force Base in Japan.In his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee on March 29, 2023, Austin said: \"The PRC is our pacing challenge. And we're driving hard to meet it. Our budget builds on our previous investments to deter aggression. We're investing in a more resilient force posture in the Indo-Pacific and increasing the scale and the scope of our exercises with our partners.\n\n\nAnd in recent months, our friends in the Indo-Pacific have taken major steps forward. The Philippines has agreed to nearly double the number of sites where we cooperate together. Japan has committed to double its defense spending. And through the historic AUKUS partnership, we'll work with our Australian and British allies to build game-changing defense advantages that will deter aggression and boost our defense industrial capacity.\"[93]\n\n\nIn March 2021, as part of their first overseas trip as members of the Biden administration, Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Japan and South Korea.[94] The trip reflected the Biden administration's concerns about China's growing influence within the Indo-Pacific region, especially their military buildup during the pandemic, as well North Korea's nuclear threat and the February 2021 coup d'état in Myanmar.[95] The trip was also part of the Biden administration's \"America is back\" diplomatic theme, and Austin pledged the U.S.'s commitment to reaffirm ties with its allies and to maintain a robust military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.[94] Austin added that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remains a top priority for the Biden Administration, and that the alliances with South Korea and Japan are among the most important tools the United States has in that regard.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin meets with Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, Vietnam, July 29, 2021\nOn March 16, 2021, the Japan-U.S. Security Consultative Committee (SCC) (Japan-U.S. \"2+2\") was convened in Tokyo. The meeting was attended by Austin and Blinken from the U.S. side, and Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu and Defense Minister Kishi Nobuo from the Japanese side. The four ministers reaffirmed that the Japan-U.S. Alliance remains the \"cornerstone\" of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region, and renewed the unwavering commitment of both countries to the Japan-U.S. Alliance.[97]\n\n\nIn June 2023, as part of his seventh official visit to the Indo-Pacific region, Austin traveled to Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada and other senior leaders, including Prime Minister Kishida Fumio and Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi. Austin's visit comes as the United States and Japan take important strides to modernize Alliance capabilities, optimize U.S. force posture, and build links with like-minded partners following the historic U.S.-Japan \"2+2\" Ministerial meeting earlier this year.[98]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Austin traveled to Australia where he participated in the 33rd Australia/U.S. ministerial consultations, also called AUSMIN. Following the meeting, DoD officials stated, \"the unbreakable alliance between the United States and Australia has never been stronger\" and \"it is doing more than ever for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.\"[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos at the Pentagon, May 3, 2023\nIn March 2021, Austin also made a three-day visit to India, where he met with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh, and other senior government officials.[100] India drew closer to the United States following its tensions with China on their disputed Sino-Indian border. Austin urged India to cancel the planned purchase of Russia's S-400 air defence system.[101]\n\n\nAustin made a second visit to India in June 2023, where he again met with Defense Minister Rajnath Singh as well as other senior leaders to discuss the ongoing joint efforts to modernize the U.S.-India Major Defense Partnership.[98]\n\n\nThe India-U.S. defense partnership has strengthened considerably in the last few years with the countries signing key defense and security pacts, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement in 2016 that allows their militaries to use each other's bases for repair and replenishment of supplies.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with Chinese State councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe, November 22, 2022\nDuring a press conference following Austin's visit to New Delhi, a senior Defense Department official described the progress between the U.S. and India: \"India's growing commitment to playing a more engaged international role, including in the Indo-Pacific Quad, demonstrates a new and growing willingness to join the United States to protect and advance a shared vision of a free, open and rules-based global order.[103]\n\n\nOn June 11, 2022, Austin condemned China's \"provocative, destabilising\" military activity near Taiwan,[104] a day after China's Defence Minister Wei Fenghe warned Austin that \"if anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese army will definitely not hesitate to start a war no matter the cost.\"[105] Austin said the United States \"will continue to fulfill our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act. That includes assisting Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.\"[106] By February 2023, he had secured the U.S. military access to nine military bases in the Philippines, which is orthogonally situated between Taiwan and the South China Sea, expediting the full implementation of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement signed during the Obama administration.[107] At the June 2023 Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Austin warned that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would be devastating.[108]\n\n\n\n### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Austin meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on June 25, 2021\nOn February 19, 2021, Austin told reporters at the Pentagon that the Biden Administration had not yet determined whether the U.S. would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the May 1 deadline set by the Trump administration in February 2020 as part of the Doha Agreement, a deal reached between the United States and the Taliban.[109] The Biden administration was considering a six-month extension.[110] Austin promised that the United States \"will not undertake a hasty or disorderly withdrawal from Afghanistan.\"[111] On March 21, 2021, Austin met with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul.[112]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Biden directed his national security team, including Austin, to begin withdrawal planning that accounted for a range of possible contingencies, including a non-combatant evacuation operation (NEO).[113] On April 14, 2021, in an address to the nation, President Biden announced that a new deadline for full withdrawal of all U.S. troops had been set for September 11, 2021. \"After consulting closely with our allies and partners, with our military leaders and intelligence personnel, with our diplomats and our development experts, with the Congress and the Vice President, as well as with [Afghan President Ashraf Ghani] and many others around the world, I concluded that it's time to end America's longest war. It's time for American troops to come home,\" he said.[114]\n\n\nSoon after the withdrawal of U.S. troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces.[115][116] On July 24, 2021, Austin said: \"In terms of whether or not [Afghanistan's military] will stop the Taliban, I think the first thing to do is to make sure that they can slow the momentum.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin with NATO's Resolute Support Mission commander Austin S. Miller in Kabul, Afghanistan, March 2021\nOn August 12, 2021, following continued Taliban victories across Afghanistan, the Biden Administration announced that 3,000 U.S. troops would be deployed to Kabul Airport to evacuate embassy personnel, US nationals and Special Immigrant Visa applicants.[118] Over the next few weeks, the Defense Department oversaw one of the largest airlifts in history, evacuating more than 120,000 Americans, Afghans and people of other nationalities.[119] Tragically, on August 26, 2021, an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a suicide bomb at Hamid Karzai International Airport, killing more than 170 civilians and 13 US service members.[120] In a statement issued on the one-year anniversary of that devastating attack at Abbey Gate, Austin said: \"The heroes we lost that day gave their lives to defend their teammates and to help save the lives of tens of thousands of innocent Afghan people who sought freedom and the opportunity for a better life.\"[121] On August 30, 2021, the last American service member left Afghanistan.[122]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Austin directed an independent After Action Review (AAR) be conducted to provide a detailed assessment of the Defense Department's implementation of US Afghanistan policy from January 2020 through August 2021. \"The purpose of the AAR was to examine decision points, constraints, and assumptions in order to contribute toward a whole-of-government effort to learn, improve and incorporate lessons learned into the Department's response to future crises.\"[123]\n\n\n\n### War in Ukraine[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Russia–United States relations and 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n![](image)Austin stated, \"I will always prioritize the protection of US military personnel in anything that we do.\"[124]\nDuring the Russian war against Ukraine, the U.S. sent tens of billions of dollars in missiles, ammunition and other items to Ukraine.[125] Austin said that he wanted to see \"Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine\".[126] The *New York Times* reported that U.S. military may be providing real-time battlefield targeting intelligence to Ukraine.[127][128][129] Austin said he \"does not\" believe that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will result in a nuclear war.[130]\n\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine, stating the \"special military operation\" is aimed at \"demilitarization\" and \"denazification\" of the country to protect ethnic Russians, prevent Kyiv's NATO membership and to keep it in Russia's \"sphere of influence\".[131]\n\n\nAustin immediately ordered deployment of 7,000 U.S. military personnel and key enablers to locations across Europe in support of Ukraine. The next day, the NATO Response Force was activated,[132] and the Biden administration authorized $350 million in military assistance from Defense Department inventories, including anti-armor, small arms and various munitions, body armor, and related equipment.[133]\n\n\nIn March 2022, the Biden administration announced $1 billion in security assistance to Ukraine, including direct transfers of Defense Department equipment to the Ukrainian military. In total, the United States has committed more than $44.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden Administration, including $43.9 billion since the beginning of Russia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion on February 24, 2022.[134]\n\n\nOn April 24, 2022, Secretary Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Kyiv, Ukraine, and met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and other Ukrainian leaders. They discussed America's stalwart support for the Ukrainian government and Ukrainian people, including through the U.S.' significant assistance to Ukraine's security, governance, economic and humanitarian needs.[135]\n\n\nOn April 26, 2022, Austin hosted a forum at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, where nearly 40 nations met to discuss current and future efforts to provide support for Ukraine. In his opening comments he articulated the purpose of the gathering, \"to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia's unjust invasion—and to build up Ukraine's defenses for tomorrow's challenges.\" Austin also made clear that the invasion of Ukraine was a \"war of choice\". \"Nobody is fooled by Putin's pretexts or by his phony claims on the Donbas [region],\" Austin said. \"Let's be clear — Russia's invasion is indefensible, and so are Russian atrocities. We all start today from a position of moral clarity: Russia is waging a war of choice to indulge the ambitions of one man.\"[136]\n\n\n\"Russia's invasion is baseless, reckless and lawless,\" Austin said. \"It is an affront to the rules-based international order. It is a challenge to free people everywhere. And, as we see this morning, nations of goodwill from around the world stand united in our resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia's imperial aggression. And that's the way it should be.\" \"The contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to intensify our efforts, coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning today's fight and the struggles to come. The monthly meetings may be in-person, virtual or mixed. And they'll extend the transparency, the integration, and the dialogue that we saw today.\"[137]\n\n\n\n![](image)Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on April 24, 2022\nOn January 20, 2023, Austin traveled to Ramstein Air Base, Germany to conduct the eighth such meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG). He was joined by ministers of defense and chiefs of defense from nearly 50 nations, including Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.[138] The meeting produced an unprecedented level of donations from allies and partners,[139] including the procurement of 31 M1 Abrams tanks for Ukraine by the U.S.[140] as part of a $400 million Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package.[141] On May 15, 2023, the Defense Department announced the arrival of the Abrams tanks to Grafenwoehr, Germany in preparation for U.S.-led training of Ukrainian tank crews and maintainers before the tanks are sent to the front lines to arm Ukrainian forces.[142]\n\n\nDuring a May 2023 Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense hearing about the Department of Defense's (DoD) Fiscal Year 2024 budget request, Senator Dick Durbin asked Austin: \"Why are you reluctant to share [with the International Criminal Court] the evidence that we have gathered in the United States through the Department of Defense for those who are holding [Russian President] Vladimir Putin accountable for his war crimes?\" Austin responded, \"The Department firmly supports the goal of holding Russia accountable for its violations in Ukraine.\" But he added, \"I will always prioritize the protection of US military personnel in anything that we do.\" When Durbin pushed him for further clarification, Austin said, \"Again, I do have concerns about reciprocity [against U.S. military personnel] going forward.\"[124][143][144]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2023, Austin hosted the 12th meeting of the UDCG, this one held virtually and attended by leaders from 50 countries.[145] Austin told those gathered, \"Today, we committed to doing even more to support Ukraine's fight for freedom. I came away from today's meeting as confident as ever in the contact group's resolve and sustained unity.\"[146]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2023, Austin delivered remarks at the 13th meeting of the UDCG, marking the United States' new package of more than $2 billion under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.[147] On July 17, 2023, he spoke at the 14th meeting of the UDCG, noting that \"Russia's war of choice has now lasted more than 500 days.[148] On September 19, 2023, at the 15th meeting of the UDCG, Austin said: \"Back in June, President Biden joined the leaders of the G7 in a joint declaration condemning, and I quote, \"Russia's illegal, unjustifiable and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. Those leaders committed to working together with Ukraine on long-term bilateral security commitments and arrangements to help secure its future.  Since June, more than 22 countries have signed on to this statement and they've started working to further deepen their support for Ukraine now and in the years to come.\"[149]\n\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has grown to include more than 54 countries – from North America to Europe to the Indo-Pacific – providing military assistance to help Ukraine. These nations also have committed: 1,000+ tanks and other armored vehicles, 800+ artillery systems, 2M+ rounds of artillery ammunition and 50+ advanced multiple rocket launching systems.[150] The group of nations has also trained thousands of Ukrainian service members in these new capabilities.[146]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Austin made his first trip to the Africa continent as Secretary of Defense. He started his tour in Djibouti, home to the primary U.S. military base on the African continent, where he met with Djiboutian leaders and Somalia’s president. He then traveled to Kenya, where he and his Kenyan counterpart signed a five-year security agreement to support working together against their common terror threat. Austin also pledged $100 million in support of Kenyan security deployments, as Kenya prepares to lead a multinational peacekeeping mission to Haiti to combat gang violence. He concluded his trip on Africa’s western coast, becoming the first U.S. defense secretary to ever visit Angola.[151]\n\n\nIn a speech delivered at the National Archives Auditorium in Luanda, Angola on September 27, Austin said: \n\n\n\"I'm here in Angola to strengthen that robust and equal partnership.  But I'm also here to underscore an important point, and that is that Africa matters. It matters profoundly to the shape of the 21st Century world.  And it matters for our common prosperity and our shared security.\"[152]\n\n\nHe went on to say: \"We know that the walk to freedom can be long, and no one gets it right all of the time.  You know, I love my country so much that I fought for it, but America isn't trying to cover up for our imperfections.  When a democracy falls short, when it falls short of its best traditions, as we all sometimes do, the whole world gets to see it.  But that's not the point.  The genius of a democracy is not that it's perfect.  The genius of a democracy is that it can always open up space to let its citizen strive to live the universal values of freedom and self-government and human rights.\n\n\nAnd the genius of a democracy is that it is always a work in progress, and that's personal for me.  I am a child of America's segregated South.  I grew up in a time of legalized and racist segregation in America, and I stand here today in Africa as America's first black secretary of defense.\"[153]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nAustin was raised by a devoutly Catholic mother and remains practicing himself.[154][155]\n\n\nAustin and his wife, Charlene Denise Banner Austin, have been married for over forty years.[3][156] Charlene worked as a non-profit administrator and served on the board of the Military Family Research Institute at Purdue University.[157] Austin has two stepsons.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Awards and decorations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The XVIII Airborne Corps command group returns home from Operation Iraqi Freedom in April 2009;

He previously served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 2021. In 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Republican-led U.S. Senate effectively blocked Garland's appointment.\n\n\nA native of the Chicago area, Garland attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and to U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and then practiced corporate litigation at Arnold & Porter, after which he worked as a federal prosecutor in the United States Department of Justice, where he supervised the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers. President Bill Clinton appointed Garland to the D.C. Court of Appeals in 1997, and he served as its chief judge from 2013 to 2020.\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in March 2016 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia. However, the Republican Senate majority refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination. The unprecedented refusal of a Senate majority to consider a Supreme Court nomination was highly controversial. Garland's nomination lasted 293 days (the longest to date), and it expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. Eventually, President Donald Trump, a Republican, nominated Neil Gorsuch to the vacant seat, and the Republican Senate majority confirmed him.\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden nominated Garland as U.S. attorney general in January 2021. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 70–30 vote, and took office in March of that same year.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMerrick Brian Garland was born on November 13, 1952, in Chicago.[1] He grew up in the north Chicago border suburb of Lincolnwood.[2][3]\n\n\nHis mother Shirley (*née* Horwitz; 1925–2016)[4] was a director of volunteer services at Chicago's Council for Jewish Elderly (now called CJE SeniorLife). His father, Cyril Garland (1915–2000),[5] headed Garland Advertising, a small business run out of the family home.[3][6][7] Garland was raised in Conservative Judaism; the family name had been changed from *Garfinkel* several generations earlier. His grandparents left the Pale of Settlement in the western Russian Empire in the early 20th century, fleeing antisemitic pogroms in what is now Ukraine and Poland, and seeking a better life for their children in the United States.[7][8] Two of his grandmother's siblings were later murdered in the Holocaust.[9] He is a second cousin of Republican six-term Iowa Governor and former Ambassador to China Terry Branstad.[10]\n\n\nGarland attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois, where he was president of the student council, acted in theatrical productions, and was a member of the debate team.[11] He graduated in 1970 as the class valedictorian.[3][2] Garland was also a Presidential Scholar and National Merit Scholar.[12][13]\n\n\nAfter high school, Garland studied social studies at Harvard University.[3][14][15] He initially wanted to become a physician, but soon decided to become a lawyer instead.[11] He allied himself with his future boss, Jamie Gorelick, when he was elected the only freshman member of a campus-wide committee on which Gorelick also served.[16] During his college summers Garland volunteered as a speechwriter to Congressman Abner J. Mikva.[16] After President Jimmy Carter appointed Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, Mikva would rely on Garland when hiring law clerks.[17] At Harvard, Garland wrote news articles and theater reviews for the *Harvard Crimson*, and was a resident of Quincy House.[18][19] Garland wrote his 235-page honors thesis on industrial mergers in Britain in the 1960s.[16][20] Garland graduated from Harvard in 1974 with an Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\n\nGarland then attended Harvard Law School,[14] where he was a member of the *Harvard Law Review*. Garland ran for the presidency of the *Law Review* but lost to Susan Estrich, so he served as an articles editor instead.[16][15] As an articles editor, Garland assigned himself to edit a submission by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan on the topic of the role of state constitutions in safeguarding individual rights.[16][17][21] This correspondence with Brennan later contributed to his winning a clerkship with the justice.[21] Garland graduated from Harvard Law in 1977 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Garland spent two years as a judicial law clerk, first for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York City) from 1977 to 1978 and then for Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1978 to 1979.[15] After his clerkships, Garland spent two years as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti.[3]\n\n\nAfter the Carter administration ended in 1981, Garland entered private practice at the law firm Arnold & Porter.[3] Garland mostly practiced corporate litigation, and was made a partner in 1985.[3] In *Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Ass'n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.* (1983) Garland acted as counsel to an insurance company suing to reinstate an unpopular automatic seat belt mandate.[22]\nAfter winning the case in both the District of Columbia Circuit Court and the Supreme Court, Garland wrote an 87-page *Harvard Law Review* article describing the way courts use a heightened \"hard look\" standard of review and scope of review when an agency chooses deregulation, with increasing focus on the fidelity of the agencies' actions to congressional intent.[22]\nIn 1985–86, while at Arnold & Porter, Garland was a lecturer at Harvard Law School, where he taught antitrust law.[15][23] He also published an article in the *Yale Law Journal* urging a broader application of antitrust immunity to state and local governments.[22]\n\n\nDesiring to return to public service and do more trial work, in 1989 Garland became an assistant United States attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. As a line prosecutor, Garland represented the government in criminal cases ranging from drug trafficking to complex public corruption matters.[3] Garland was one of the three principal prosecutors who handled the investigation into Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry's possession of cocaine.[24]\n\n\nGarland then briefly returned to Arnold & Porter, working there from 1992 to 1993.[16] In 1993, Garland joined the new Clinton administration as deputy assistant attorney general in the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice.[3] The following year, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick – a key mentor of Garland's[25] – asked Garland to be her principal associate deputy attorney general.[3][26]\n\n\nIn that role, Garland's responsibilities included the supervision of high-profile domestic-terrorism cases, including the Oklahoma City bombing, Ted Kaczynski (also known as the \"Unabomber\"), and the Atlanta Olympics bombings.[3][27]\n\n\nGarland insisted on being sent to Oklahoma City in the aftermath of the attack, in order to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution.[28] He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.[28] Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could not because he was needed at the Justice Department headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, D.C., where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols.[28] Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating.[3]\n\n\nGarland served as co-chair of the administrative law section of the District of Columbia Bar from 1991 to 1994.[15][29] He is also a member of the American Law Institute.[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, Garland was elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers, completing the unexpired term of Deval Patrick, who had stepped down from the board.[30] Garland served as president of the overseers for 2009–10.[31]\n\n\n\n## Federal judicial service (1997–2021)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garland in 2016 as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit\nOn September 6, 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seat vacated by his longtime mentor Abner J. Mikva.[16] Justice Brennan, for whom Garland had clerked, recommended Garland for the position in a letter to Clinton.[21] The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Garland a \"well-qualified\" committee rating, its highest.[32]\n\n\nOn December 1, 1995, Garland received a hearing regarding the nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[33] In Senate confirmation hearings Garland said that the Supreme Court justices whom he most admired were Justice Brennan, for whom he clerked, and Chief Justice John Marshall. Garland also expressed admiration for the writing style of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[34] However, Senate Republicans did not schedule a vote on Garland's confirmation,[3] not because of concerns over Garland's qualifications, but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.[23][35]\n\n\nAfter winning the November 1996 presidential election, Clinton renominated Garland on January 7, 1997.[36] He was confirmed on March 19, 1997, by a 76–23 vote.[37] The majority of Republican senators voted to confirm Garland, including Senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, and Jim Inhofe.[38] Senators Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and Jeff Sessions were among those who voted against Garland.[38] All of the 23 \"no\" votes came from Republicans, and all were said to be based \"on whether there was even a need for an eleventh seat\" on the D.C. Circuit.[39] He received his judicial commission on March 20, 1997.[40]\n\n\n\n### Service as chief judge[edit]\n\n\nGarland became chief judge of the D.C. Circuit on February 12, 2013.[41] As chief judge, Garland announced in May 2013 that the D.C. Circuit had unanimously decided to provide the public with same-day audio recordings of oral arguments in the court.[42][43][40] As chief judge, Garland was an active member of the Judicial Conference of the United States,[44] and was involved in the formulation of new rules to protect federal judicial branch employees from workplace harassment, which were adopted in the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Alex Kozinski.[44][45] Garland's seven-year term as chief judge ended on February 11, 2020, with Judge Sri Srinivasan succeeding him.[44] Garland continued to serve as an active member of the court until his retirement.[46][47][40]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nGarland is considered a judicial moderate and a centrist.[48] Garland has been described by Nina Totenberg and Carrie Johnson of NPR as \"a moderate liberal, with a definite pro-prosecution bent in criminal cases\".[3] Tom Goldstein, the publisher of *SCOTUSblog*, wrote in 2010 that \"Judge Garland's record demonstrates that he is essentially the model, neutral judge. His opinions avoid unnecessary, sweeping pronouncements.\"[23] Garland has a reputation for collegiality and his opinions rarely draw a dissent.[49] As of 2016, Garland had written just fifteen dissents in his two decades on the court, fewer than his colleague Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote some 17 dissents over the previous decade.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Administrative and environmental law[edit]\n\n\nGarland has tended to favor deference to regulatory agencies.[50] For example, in *In re Aiken County* (2013), Garland dissented when the court issued mandamus ordering the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository license.[51] In *Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration* (2013), Garland joined a divided court upholding the DEA's classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug.[11] However, according to Goldstein, in a number of split decisions on environmental law Garland \"favored contested EPA regulations and actions when challenged by industry, and in other cases he has accepted challenges brought by environmental groups.\"[23] In *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton* (2003), Garland found the arroyo toad was protected by the federal Endangered Species Act.[52] Circuit Judge John Roberts dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, writing that Congress's interstate commerce power cannot reach \"a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\"[53]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal law and whistleblower protection[edit]\n\n\nWhile on the bench, Garland has shown a tendency to be deferential to the government in criminal cases, siding with prosecutors in ten of the fourteen criminal cases in which he disagreed with a colleague.[54] For example, in *United States v. Watson* (1999), Garland dissented when the court concluded a prosecutor's closing argument was unduly prejudicial, objecting that a conviction should be reversed for only \"the most egregious of these kind of errors.\"[54] In 2007, Garland dissented when the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed the conviction of a Washington, D.C. police officer who had accepted bribes in an FBI sting operation.[55]\n\n\nGarland has taken a broad view of whistleblower protection laws, such as the False Claims Act (FCA),[56] which creates a private cause of action against those defrauding the federal government.[55] For example, in *United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University* (1998), Garland wrote for the court in holding that a plaintiff alleging he had been fired by Howard University for whistleblowing could sue under the FCA for retaliation.[23] In *United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp.* (2004), Garland dissented when the court, in an opinion written by Judge John Roberts, held that the FCA did not apply to false claims submitted to Amtrak because Amtrak is not the government.[55][56] Roberts justified his narrow reading by citing a book by Circuit Judge Henry Friendly.[57] In dissent, Garland (who like Roberts had clerked for Friendly), cited Friendly's book as supporting the use of legislative intent,[55] writing that Roberts was relying on \"'canons' of statutory construction, which serve there as 'cannons' of statutory destruction.\"[56][58] Garland's dissent, expressing concerns that the court's ruling would impede the government's ability to pursue false claims cases against federal grantees, is credited with sparking the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, which eliminated the loophole.[56] During confirmation hearings in 2005, Senator Chuck Grassley sharply questioned Roberts on why he had not adopted Garland's reading.[55] Roberts replied, \"Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.\"[55]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\nDuring Garland's tenure, the D.C. Circuit reviewed cases arising from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In *al Odah v. United States* (2003), a panel that included Garland unanimously held that federal courts could not hear challenges from Guantanamo detainees.[23] In July 2011, Garland wrote for the unanimous panel when it rejected Guantanamo detainee Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alawi's petition for *habeas corpus*.[59][60] In *Parhat v. Gates* (2008), Garland wrote for a panel that unanimously overturned the Combatant Status Review Tribunal's determination that a captured Uyghur was an enemy combatant.[61] In *Saleh v. Titan Corp.* (2009), Garland dissented from the court's holding that former Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison could not sue private military contractors who participated in torture and prisoner abuse. Garland wrote that the suit should be allowed to proceed because \"no act of Congress and no judicial precedent\" immunized the contractors from tort liability, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically excludes contractors, and tort liability would not interfere with government operations.[62][63][64]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Goldstein, Garland has \"tended to take a broader view\" of First Amendment rights.[23] In cases involving the Freedom of Information Act and similar provisions related to government transparency, \"Judge Garland's rulings reflect a preference for open government.\"[23] In *ACLU v. CIA* (2013), Garland wrote for a panel unanimously rejecting the agency's Glomar response and ordering it to process the ACLU's FOIA request regarding targeted killings by CIA drones.[65] In *Cause of Action v. FTC* (2015), Garland wrote for a panel unanimously overturning the agency's limitation on FOIA fee waivers to large news outlets.[65]\n\n\nIn *Lee v. Department of Justice* (2005), Garland dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's order holding reporters in contempt of court for refusing to testify about their anonymous sources during the Wen Ho Lee investigation.[64][66] Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to \"weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter's sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure\" and that the decision \"undermined the Founders' intention to protect the press 'so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.'\"[66] In *Initiative & Referendum Institute v. U.S. Postal Service* (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a U.S. Postal Service regulation banning signature-gathering for petitions at post offices violated the First Amendment.[23][66] Garland found the regulation to be facially overbroad and not narrowly tailored.[66]\n\n\nIn cases involving campaign finance reform laws, Garland has applied *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* when he believed that he was compelled to do so, but he has not sought to extend its holding.[64] In *Wagner v. Federal Election Commission* (2015), Garland wrote for the unanimous en banc D.C. Circuit in upholding a prohibition on campaign contributions from federal contractors because of the governmental interest in preventing corruption.[64][67] In *National Association of Manufacturers v. Taylor* (2009), Garland wrote for the court in a decision upholding the constitutionality of lobbyist disclosure requirements under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.[42][67] Professor Rick Hasen, an election-law expert, writes that Garland's opinions on election law are characterized by careful application of precedent and indicate that Garland believes in reasonable regulation.[67]\n\n\nGarland has addressed a number of religious freedom cases while on the D.C. Circuit, although several of these have been decided on procedural grounds.[68] In 2002, Garland joined a unanimous court in ruling for two federal prisoners who were denied the right to consume communion wine.[68][69] In 2010, Garland wrote the decision for a unanimous court in favor of an Interior Department employee who brought a religious-discrimination claim after the Interior Department refused to allow her to work weekdays rather than Sunday, when she wished to attend church and Bible study.[68][70]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Garland voted in favor of *en banc* review of the D.C. Circuit's panel decision in *Parker v. District of Columbia* invalidating the D.C. handgun ban. The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed this invalidation 5–4 in an opinion by Justice Scalia.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Other cases[edit]\n\n\nIn *Alexander v. Daley* (2003), Garland joined a decision (authored by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly), rejecting a challenge brought by District of Columbia residents seeking D.C. congressional voting rights.[24][71]\n\n\nIn *Hutchins v. District of Columbia* (1999), Garland concurred with four other D.C. Circuit judges (*en banc*) that D.C.'s Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 implicated at least some significant right of minors.[72] He joined parts of a plurality opinion written by Judge Laurence Silberman that upheld the juvenile curfew under intermediate scrutiny and a vagueness challenge. Garland also joined the part of Judge Judith W. Rogers's opinion (concurring in part and dissenting in part) holding that a fundamental right to intrastate travel exists.[73]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nGarland retired from federal judicial service on March 11, 2021, to accept appointment as the Attorney General of the United States.[40]\n\n\n\n## Supreme Court nomination[edit]\n\n\nGarland was considered twice to fill vacated seats on the United States Supreme Court in 2009 and 2010, before finally being nominated in 2016 by President Barack Obama for the seat left vacant by the death of conservative Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.[74]\n\n\n\n### 2009 and 2010 considerations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, following the announcement by Justice David Souter that he would retire, Garland was considered as one of nine finalists for the post, which ultimately went to Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge of the Second Circuit.[75]\n\n\nAfter the April 2010 announcement by Justice John Paul Stevens that he would retire, Garland was again widely seen as a leading contender for a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.[76][77][78] President Obama interviewed Garland, among others, for the vacancy.[48] In May 2010, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he would help Obama if Garland was nominated, calling Garland \"a consensus nominee\" and predicting that Garland would win Senate confirmation with bipartisan support.[79][80] Obama nominated Solicitor General of the United States Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August 2010.[48]\n\n\n\n### Scalia vacancy and 2016 nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Garland with President Barack Obama in 2016\nOn February 13, 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died.[81] Later that day, Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement that they would not consider any nominee put forth by Obama, and that a Supreme Court nomination should be left to the next president of the United States.[82][83][84] President Obama responded that he intended to \"fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court,\"[85][86] and that there was no \"well established tradition\" that a president could not fill a Supreme Court vacancy during their last year in office.[87]\n\n\nIn early March 2016, *The New York Times* reported that Garland was being vetted by the Obama administration as a potential nominee. A week later, Garland was named as one of three judges on the President's \"short list\" (along with Judge Sri Srinivasan, also of the D.C. Circuit, and Judge Paul J. Watford of the Ninth Circuit). Obama interviewed all three leading contenders, as well as two others who were being considered: Judge Jane L. Kelly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[88] Soon afterward, Senator Orrin Hatch, President pro tempore of the United States Senate and the most senior Republican Senator, predicted that President Obama would \"name someone the liberal Democratic base wants\" even though he \"could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.\"[89] Five days later, on March 16, Obama formally nominated Garland to the vacant post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.[90][91]\n\n\nGarland had more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history,[38] and was the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell Jr. in 1971.[92] The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Garland \"well-qualified\" (its highest rating) to sit on the Supreme Court.[93]\n\n\nUnder Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate's Republican majority refused to consider Garland's nomination, holding \"no hearings, no votes, no action whatsoever\" on the nomination.[94][95][96] McConnell's categorical refusal to hold hearings on Garland's nomination was described by political scientists and legal scholars as unprecedented,[95][97][98] McConnell's choice to lead a Republican blockade of the nomination was described as a \"culmination of [his] confrontational style,\"[99] and an example of constitutional hardball.[100] Yascha Mounk called it a \"blatant abuse of constitutional norms.\"[101]\n\n\nAfter a period of 293 days, Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress.[102] It was the longest confirmation delay of a Supreme Court nominee in history, far exceeding the 125-day delay faced by the ultimately confirmed Justice Louis Brandeis in 1916.[103] On January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Court vacancy.[104] On April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\n\nMcConnell went on to boast about stopping Garland's nomination, saying in August 2016, \"one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'\"[105][106] In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act upon the Garland nomination was \"the most consequential decision I've made in my entire public career\".[107]\n\n\n\n## Attorney General (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garland is sworn in as Attorney General in March 2021.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden selected Garland for the position of United States attorney general, with news of the selection coming on January 6, 2021.[108][109] He was formally nominated by Biden on January 20, after Biden took office.[110] In Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, Garland vowed to oversee vigorous prosecution of those who stormed the United States Capitol, and other domestic extremists, drawing on his experience prosecuting the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City bombing.[111][112][113] Garland said it was likely the Biden administration would place a moratorium on use of the federal death penalty and expressed reservations about the death penalty in light of the \"almost randomness or arbitrariness of its application.\"[113] He pledged to protect equal justice under law and reinvigorate the DOJ Civil Rights Division, which, according to some media figures, languished under the Trump administration.[112][114] Garland affirmed that the Justice Department would remain independent under his leadership.[113] The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15–7 to advance Garland's nomination to the Senate floor,[115][116] and on March 10, the Senate confirmed Garland's nomination by a vote of 70–30.[117][111][118] He was sworn in on March 11, 2021, by Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus.[119]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Russia imposed sanctions against Garland, including prohibiting him from entering Russia. This was in retaliation for U.S. expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats, a sanction imposed by the United States against Russia for its SolarWinds hack, aggression against Ukraine, and interference in the 2020 U.S. election.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)Merrick Garland delivering remarks in the East Room of the White House, May 16, 2022,\nIn May 2021, the DOJ appealed in part a ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District Court for the District of Columbia to make public most of a DOJ memo detailing former Attorney General Bill Barr's legal rationale for clearing President Trump of obstruction of justice in the Special Counsel investigation.[121][122][123][124]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2021, the Justice Department continued its defense of a defamation lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, arguing that President Trump could not be sued because he had denied her rape allegation in offending statements in his presidential capacity. Garland had been deeply involved in the decision. The White House quickly distanced itself from the decision.[121][122][125] Garland in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on October 21 stated that the DOJ's briefing was solely on the question of the application of the Federal Tort Claims Act.[126][127]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Garland imposed a moratorium on all federal executions pending a review of relevant policies and procedures.[128] The review will examine \"the risk of pain and suffering associated with the use of pentobarbital,\" \"regulations made in November 2020 that expanded the permissible methods of execution beyond lethal injection, and authorized the use of state facilities and personnel in federal executions\", and \"December 2020 and January 2021 changes to expedite execution of capital sentences.\"[128][129][130] This was consistent with Biden's pledge to push for legislation to end the federal death penalty. In spite of this, Garland has continued to pursue the death penalty in cases wherein a previous administration had sought the death penalty against a suspected terrorist.[131] The Trump administration resumed federal executions in 2019, and executed 13 inmates in total, the first in 17 years and including the first woman in 70 years.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garland with Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue in Washington, D.C., October 13, 2022.\nIn June 2021, Garland pledged to double the department's enforcement staff for protecting the right to vote, in response to Republican Party efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election,[132][133] The same month, Garland announced a DOJ lawsuit against the state of Georgia over its newly passed restrictions on voting; the DOJ complaint said that the state targeted Black Americans in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.[134]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Justice Department released two guidance documents regarding election law changes and post-election audits, reminding states that the DOJ was closely observing states' compliance with federal election and civil rights laws.[121][135][136]\n\n\nIn November 2021, the DOJ sued Texas over Senate Bill 1 which required rejection of mail ballots \"for immaterial errors and omissions,\" alleging it would restrict voting for those with limited English proficiency, soldiers deployed and voters overseas.[137][138]\n\n\nIn a separate suit filed by DOJ against Texas the following month, the federal government alleged that Texas' redistricting plans discriminated against Latino and Black voters in violation of the Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.[139][140][141][142]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nDuring Garland's tenure as AG, the Justice Department has emphasized protection of civil rights.[143] Garland rescinded a Trump administration policy (imposed by Jeff Sessions) that curtailed DOJ investigations into police department misconduct (\"pattern-and-practice\" investigations) and restricted the use of consent decrees to reform police departments.[143][144][145]\n\n\n\n![](image)Garland meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, March 3, 2023\nOn April 21, 2021, Garland subsequently announced that the DOJ was opening a pattern-and-practice investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department after former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted for the murder of George Floyd, examining the use of force by officers and discriminatory conduct, its treatment of people with behavioral health issues, and the department's current accountability systems.[146] On April 26, Garland announced another investigation into the Louisville Metro Police Department in the aftermath of the killing of Breonna Taylor, examining the execution of search warrants.[147][148] On August 5, Garland opened another investigation into the Phoenix Police Department over its policies on dealing with the homeless.[149][150] On December 3, the DOJ opened another investigation into the Mount Vernon Police Department to assess if it engaged in discriminatory policing, involving its use of force, strip and body cavity searches, how it handles evidence, and its systems of accountability.[151][152]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the DOJ, through a memo issued by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, reversed a Trump-era policy that banned federal officers and agents from using body-worn cameras; the memo also mandated the use of body-worn cameras for federal law enforcement in certain circumstances (including when carrying out planned arrests or executing search warrants).[153][154][155]\n\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the DOJ announced a civil investigation into prisons in Georgia, focusing on prison violence and sexual abuse of LGBTQ prisoners by prisoners and staff, continuing with an initial investigation launched in 2016.[156][157][158]\n\n\nIn September, 2021, the DOJ in a memo limited the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints by federal officers during arrests, prohibiting such tactics unless deadly force is authorized (i.e., unless the officer reasonably believes \"that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person\"). The memo also limited the use of unannounced (\"no-knock\") entries when executing warrants, directing officers to knock-and-announce except \"where an agent has reasonable grounds to believe that knocking and announcing the agent’s presence would create an imminent threat of physical violence to the agent and/or another person.\"[159][160][161]\n\n\nOn October 13, 2021, the DOJ launched another investigation into five juvenile detention facilities in Texas for systemic physical or sexual abuse of children.[157][162]\n\n\n\n### January 6 U.S. Capitol attack[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: January 6 United States Capitol attack\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the DOJ sent letters to former DOJ officials of the Trump administration, including Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, Associate Deputy Attorney General Patrick Hovakimian, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Byung J. \"BJay\" Pak, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Bobby L. Christine, and United States Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division Jeffrey Clark.[163] The letters relayed that the DOJ would not exert executive privilege over their testimony as witnesses to Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election or the 2021 United States Capitol attack, and that they were free to provide \"unrestricted testimony\" and \"irrespective of potential privilege\" to the House Oversight Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee.[163][164][165][166]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2021, the DOJ further rejected Rep. Mo Brooks's request to protect him in Eric Swalwell's civil lawsuit against him and President Trump concerning his comments and actions in the attack. The DOJ in a court filing determined that Brooks' relevant comments and actions were outside the scope of his official responsibilities as a member of Congress.[167]\n\n\nOn October 21, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to refer Steve Bannon, the adviser to former President Donald Trump, to the DOJ for criminal contempt of Congress due to defying a subpoena from the House's January 6 select committee over claims of executive privilege. After Speaker Nancy Pelosi certified the contempt referral, it was sent to the U.S. Attorney for DC, who will then decide whether to send the referral to a grand jury for indictment, with Garland having the final say.[168] Garland told lawmakers that the Justice Department \"will apply the facts and the law and make a decision\" when considering a criminal contempt referral for Bannon. He stated that \"the Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances, we'll apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution.\"[126][127][168][169]\n\n\nIn November 2022, days after Trump announced his 2024 presidential campaign, Garland appointed Jack Smith to serve as special counsel for the investigations of Trump.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### School board memo[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2021, amid a surge of threats against school board members across the country, Garland issued a memorandum addressing an \"increase in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff\"; the memo directed the FBI and US attorneys' offices to set up meetings with federal, state and local law enforcement leaders for establishing tiplines for threat reporting and discussing strategies to address such threats.[172][173][126][174] He issued the memo soon after the National School Boards Association wrote to Biden to request a federal response to the protests and threats against school officials and investigations into whether they constituted as forms of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.[175][176][177][178]\n\n\nThe memo prompted criticism from Republicans in the House and Senate, who accused Garland of treating parents like domestic terrorists, although the memo did not mention either of them.[174] McConnell wrote to Garland that parents \"absolutely should be telling\" local schools what to teach regarding contentious public issues.[173][179] In House and Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, Garland pushed back on Republicans' claims that the DOJ were treating parents like \"domestic terrorists\" and investigating political speech, testifying that the DOJ \"[were] not investigating peaceful protest or parent involvement at school board meetings.\"[126][127][180][181] Numerous Senate Republicans called on Garland to resign over the memo.[182] Seventeen Republican state attorneys general led by Todd Rokita, and numerous House Republicans, separately wrote to Biden and Garland requesting the memorandum be immediately withdrawn.[174][178][180]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGarland and his wife, Lynn, were married at the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan in September 1987. Lynn Rosenman Garland's grandfather, Samuel Irving Rosenman, was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (a trial-level court) and a special counsel to presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and cum laude from Harvard University, and received a Master of Science degree in operations management from the MIT Sloan School of Management. Her father, Robert Rosenman, was a partner in the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore.[6] As of June 2018, she advised government and nonprofit groups on voting systems security and accuracy issues.[183] The couple lives together in Bethesda, Maryland.[184]\n\n\nGarland and his wife have two daughters, Rebecca and Jessica; both are graduates of Yale University.[185] Justice Elena Kagan hired Jessica Garland, a 2019 graduate of Yale Law School, as one of her law clerks in early July 2020, before Biden's election and Garland's appointment, to serve as a law clerk in 2022–2023. The Supreme Court said that \"in light of the potential for actual or apparent conflicts of interest,\" Jessica Garland will not serve as Kagan's law clerk while her father remains as attorney general.[186] Garland took part in the ceremony when his daughter Rebecca married Xan Tanner in June 2018.[183]\n\n\nFinancial disclosure forms in 2016 indicated that Garland's net worth at the time was between $6 million and $23M.[17] As of 2021, his net worth was estimated by *Forbes* at $8.6-33M.[187]\n\n\nGarland is red-green colorblind, so he uses a list to match his suits and ties.[17]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\n* Garland, Merrick B.

He previously served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 2021. In 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Republican-led U.S. Senate effectively blocked Garland's appointment.\n\n\nA native of the Chicago area, Garland attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and to U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and then practiced corporate litigation at Arnold & Porter, after which he worked as a federal prosecutor in the United States Department of Justice, where he supervised the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers. President Bill Clinton appointed Garland to the D.C. Court of Appeals in 1997, and he served as its chief judge from 2013 to 2020.\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in March 2016 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia. However, the Republican Senate majority refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination. The unprecedented refusal of a Senate majority to consider a Supreme Court nomination was highly controversial. Garland's nomination lasted 293 days (the longest to date), and it expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. Eventually, President Donald Trump, a Republican, nominated Neil Gorsuch to the vacant seat, and the Republican Senate majority confirmed him.\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden nominated Garland as U.S. attorney general in January 2021. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 70–30 vote, and took office in March of that same year.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMerrick Brian Garland was born on November 13, 1952, in Chicago.[1] He grew up in the north Chicago border suburb of Lincolnwood.[2][3]\n\n\nHis mother Shirley (*née* Horwitz; 1925–2016)[4] was a director of volunteer services at Chicago's Council for Jewish Elderly (now called CJE SeniorLife). His father, Cyril Garland (1915–2000),[5] headed Garland Advertising, a small business run out of the family home.[3][6][7] Garland was raised in Conservative Judaism; the family name had been changed from *Garfinkel* several generations earlier. His grandparents left the Pale of Settlement in the western Russian Empire in the early 20th century, fleeing antisemitic pogroms in what is now Ukraine and Poland, and seeking a better life for their children in the United States.[7][8] Two of his grandmother's siblings were later murdered in the Holocaust.[9] He is a second cousin of Republican six-term Iowa Governor and former Ambassador to China Terry Branstad.[10]\n\n\nGarland attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois, where he was president of the student council, acted in theatrical productions, and was a member of the debate team.[11] He graduated in 1970 as the class valedictorian.[3][2] Garland was also a Presidential Scholar and National Merit Scholar.[12][13]\n\n\nAfter high school, Garland studied social studies at Harvard University.[3][14][15] He initially wanted to become a physician, but soon decided to become a lawyer instead.[11] He allied himself with his future boss, Jamie Gorelick, when he was elected the only freshman member of a campus-wide committee on which Gorelick also served.[16] During his college summers Garland volunteered as a speechwriter to Congressman Abner J. Mikva.[16] After President Jimmy Carter appointed Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, Mikva would rely on Garland when hiring law clerks.[17] At Harvard, Garland wrote news articles and theater reviews for the *Harvard Crimson*, and was a resident of Quincy House.[18][19] Garland wrote his 235-page honors thesis on industrial mergers in Britain in the 1960s.[16][20] Garland graduated from Harvard in 1974 with an Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\n\nGarland then attended Harvard Law School,[14] where he was a member of the *Harvard Law Review*. Garland ran for the presidency of the *Law Review* but lost to Susan Estrich, so he served as an articles editor instead.[16][15] As an articles editor, Garland assigned himself to edit a submission by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan on the topic of the role of state constitutions in safeguarding individual rights.[16][17][21] This correspondence with Brennan later contributed to his winning a clerkship with the justice.[21] Garland graduated from Harvard Law in 1977 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Garland spent two years as a judicial law clerk, first for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York City) from 1977 to 1978 and then for Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1978 to 1979.[15] After his clerkships, Garland spent two years as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti.[3]\n\n\nAfter the Carter administration ended in 1981, Garland entered private practice at the law firm Arnold & Porter.[3] Garland mostly practiced corporate litigation, and was made a partner in 1985.[3] In *Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Ass'n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.* (1983) Garland acted as counsel to an insurance company suing to reinstate an unpopular automatic seat belt mandate.[22]\nAfter winning the case in both the District of Columbia Circuit Court and the Supreme Court, Garland wrote an 87-page *Harvard Law Review* article describing the way courts use a heightened \"hard look\" standard of review and scope of review when an agency chooses deregulation, with increasing focus on the fidelity of the agencies' actions to congressional intent.[22]\nIn 1985–86, while at Arnold & Porter, Garland was a lecturer at Harvard Law School, where he taught antitrust law.[15][23] He also published an article in the *Yale Law Journal* urging a broader application of antitrust immunity to state and local governments.[22]\n\n\nDesiring to return to public service and do more trial work, in 1989 Garland became an assistant United States attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. As a line prosecutor, Garland represented the government in criminal cases ranging from drug trafficking to complex public corruption matters.[3] Garland was one of the three principal prosecutors who handled the investigation into Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry's possession of cocaine.[24]\n\n\nGarland then briefly returned to Arnold & Porter, working there from 1992 to 1993.[16] In 1993, Garland joined the new Clinton administration as deputy assistant attorney general in the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice.[3] The following year, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick – a key mentor of Garland's[25] – asked Garland to be her principal associate deputy attorney general.[3][26]\n\n\nIn that role, Garland's responsibilities included the supervision of high-profile domestic-terrorism cases, including the Oklahoma City bombing, Ted Kaczynski (also known as the \"Unabomber\"), and the Atlanta Olympics bombings.[3][27]\n\n\nGarland insisted on being sent to Oklahoma City in the aftermath of the attack, in order to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution.[28] He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.[28] Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could not because he was needed at the Justice Department headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, D.C., where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols.[28] Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating.[3]\n\n\nGarland served as co-chair of the administrative law section of the District of Columbia Bar from 1991 to 1994.[15][29] He is also a member of the American Law Institute.[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, Garland was elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers, completing the unexpired term of Deval Patrick, who had stepped down from the board.[30] Garland served as president of the overseers for 2009–10.[31]\n\n\n\n## Federal judicial service (1997–2021)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garland in 2016 as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit\nOn September 6, 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seat vacated by his longtime mentor Abner J. Mikva.[16] Justice Brennan, for whom Garland had clerked, recommended Garland for the position in a letter to Clinton.[21] The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Garland a \"well-qualified\" committee rating, its highest.[32]\n\n\nOn December 1, 1995, Garland received a hearing regarding the nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[33] In Senate confirmation hearings Garland said that the Supreme Court justices whom he most admired were Justice Brennan, for whom he clerked, and Chief Justice John Marshall. Garland also expressed admiration for the writing style of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[34] However, Senate Republicans did not schedule a vote on Garland's confirmation,[3] not because of concerns over Garland's qualifications, but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.[23][35]\n\n\nAfter winning the November 1996 presidential election, Clinton renominated Garland on January 7, 1997.[36] He was confirmed on March 19, 1997, by a 76–23 vote.[37] The majority of Republican senators voted to confirm Garland, including Senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, and Jim Inhofe.[38] Senators Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and Jeff Sessions were among those who voted against Garland.[38] All of the 23 \"no\" votes came from Republicans, and all were said to be based \"on whether there was even a need for an eleventh seat\" on the D.C. Circuit.[39] He received his judicial commission on March 20, 1997.[40]\n\n\n\n### Service as chief judge[edit]\n\n\nGarland became chief judge of the D.C. Circuit on February 12, 2013.[41] As chief judge, Garland announced in May 2013 that the D.C. Circuit had unanimously decided to provide the public with same-day audio recordings of oral arguments in the court.[42][43][40] As chief judge, Garland was an active member of the Judicial Conference of the United States,[44] and was involved in the formulation of new rules to protect federal judicial branch employees from workplace harassment, which were adopted in the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Alex Kozinski.[44][45] Garland's seven-year term as chief judge ended on February 11, 2020, with Judge Sri Srinivasan succeeding him.[44] Garland continued to serve as an active member of the court until his retirement.[46][47][40]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nGarland is considered a judicial moderate and a centrist.[48] Garland has been described by Nina Totenberg and Carrie Johnson of NPR as \"a moderate liberal, with a definite pro-prosecution bent in criminal cases\".[3] Tom Goldstein, the publisher of *SCOTUSblog*, wrote in 2010 that \"Judge Garland's record demonstrates that he is essentially the model, neutral judge. His opinions avoid unnecessary, sweeping pronouncements.\"[23] Garland has a reputation for collegiality and his opinions rarely draw a dissent.[49] As of 2016, Garland had written just fifteen dissents in his two decades on the court, fewer than his colleague Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote some 17 dissents over the previous decade.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Administrative and environmental law[edit]\n\n\nGarland has tended to favor deference to regulatory agencies.[50] For example, in *In re Aiken County* (2013), Garland dissented when the court issued mandamus ordering the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository license.[51] In *Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration* (2013), Garland joined a divided court upholding the DEA's classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug.[11] However, according to Goldstein, in a number of split decisions on environmental law Garland \"favored contested EPA regulations and actions when challenged by industry, and in other cases he has accepted challenges brought by environmental groups.\"[23] In *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton* (2003), Garland found the arroyo toad was protected by the federal Endangered Species Act.[52] Circuit Judge John Roberts dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, writing that Congress's interstate commerce power cannot reach \"a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\"[53]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal law and whistleblower protection[edit]\n\n\nWhile on the bench, Garland has shown a tendency to be deferential to the government in criminal cases, siding with prosecutors in ten of the fourteen criminal cases in which he disagreed with a colleague.[54] For example, in *United States v. Watson* (1999), Garland dissented when the court concluded a prosecutor's closing argument was unduly prejudicial, objecting that a conviction should be reversed for only \"the most egregious of these kind of errors.\"[54] In 2007, Garland dissented when the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed the conviction of a Washington, D.C. police officer who had accepted bribes in an FBI sting operation.[55]\n\n\nGarland has taken a broad view of whistleblower protection laws, such as the False Claims Act (FCA),[56] which creates a private cause of action against those defrauding the federal government.[55] For example, in *United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University* (1998), Garland wrote for the court in holding that a plaintiff alleging he had been fired by Howard University for whistleblowing could sue under the FCA for retaliation.[23] In *United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp.* (2004), Garland dissented when the court, in an opinion written by Judge John Roberts, held that the FCA did not apply to false claims submitted to Amtrak because Amtrak is not the government.[55][56] Roberts justified his narrow reading by citing a book by Circuit Judge Henry Friendly.[57] In dissent, Garland (who like Roberts had clerked for Friendly), cited Friendly's book as supporting the use of legislative intent,[55] writing that Roberts was relying on \"'canons' of statutory construction, which serve there as 'cannons' of statutory destruction.\"[56][58] Garland's dissent, expressing concerns that the court's ruling would impede the government's ability to pursue false claims cases against federal grantees, is credited with sparking the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, which eliminated the loophole.[56] During confirmation hearings in 2005, Senator Chuck Grassley sharply questioned Roberts on why he had not adopted Garland's reading.[55] Roberts replied, \"Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you're in a difficult area.\"[55]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\nDuring Garland's tenure, the D.C. Circuit reviewed cases arising from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In *al Odah v. United States* (2003), a panel that included Garland unanimously held that federal courts could not hear challenges from Guantanamo detainees.[23] In July 2011, Garland wrote for the unanimous panel when it rejected Guantanamo detainee Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alawi's petition for *habeas corpus*.[59][60] In *Parhat v. Gates* (2008), Garland wrote for a panel that unanimously overturned the Combatant Status Review Tribunal's determination that a captured Uyghur was an enemy combatant.[61] In *Saleh v. Titan Corp.* (2009), Garland dissented from the court's holding that former Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison could not sue private military contractors who participated in torture and prisoner abuse. Garland wrote that the suit should be allowed to proceed because \"no act of Congress and no judicial precedent\" immunized the contractors from tort liability, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically excludes contractors, and tort liability would not interfere with government operations.[62][63][64]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Goldstein, Garland has \"tended to take a broader view\" of First Amendment rights.[23] In cases involving the Freedom of Information Act and similar provisions related to government transparency, \"Judge Garland's rulings reflect a preference for open government.\"[23] In *ACLU v. CIA* (2013), Garland wrote for a panel unanimously rejecting the agency's Glomar response and ordering it to process the ACLU's FOIA request regarding targeted killings by CIA drones.[65] In *Cause of Action v. FTC* (2015), Garland wrote for a panel unanimously overturning the agency's limitation on FOIA fee waivers to large news outlets.[65]\n\n\nIn *Lee v. Department of Justice* (2005), Garland dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court's order holding reporters in contempt of court for refusing to testify about their anonymous sources during the Wen Ho Lee investigation.[64][66] Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to \"weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter's sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure\" and that the decision \"undermined the Founders' intention to protect the press 'so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.'\"[66] In *Initiative & Referendum Institute v. U.S. Postal Service* (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a U.S. Postal Service regulation banning signature-gathering for petitions at post offices violated the First Amendment.[23][66] Garland found the regulation to be facially overbroad and not narrowly tailored.[66]\n\n\nIn cases involving campaign finance reform laws, Garland has applied *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* when he believed that he was compelled to do so, but he has not sought to extend its holding.[64] In *Wagner v. Federal Election Commission* (2015), Garland wrote for the unanimous en banc D.C. Circuit in upholding a prohibition on campaign contributions from federal contractors because of the governmental interest in preventing corruption.[64][67] In *National Association of Manufacturers v. Taylor* (2009), Garland wrote for the court in a decision upholding the constitutionality of lobbyist disclosure requirements under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.[42][67] Professor Rick Hasen, an election-law expert, writes that Garland's opinions on election law are characterized by careful application of precedent and indicate that Garland believes in reasonable regulation.[67]\n\n\nGarland has addressed a number of religious freedom cases while on the D.C. Circuit, although several of these have been decided on procedural grounds.[68] In 2002, Garland joined a unanimous court in ruling for two federal prisoners who were denied the right to consume communion wine.[68][69] In 2010, Garland wrote the decision for a unanimous court in favor of an Interior Department employee who brought a religious-discrimination claim after the Interior Department refused to allow her to work weekdays rather than Sunday, when she wished to attend church and Bible study.[68][70]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Garland voted in favor of *en banc* review of the D.C. Circuit's panel decision in *Parker v. District of Columbia* invalidating the D.C. handgun ban. The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed this invalidation 5–4 in an opinion by Justice Scalia.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Other cases[edit]\n\n\nIn *Alexander v. Daley* (2003), Garland joined a decision (authored by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly), rejecting a challenge brought by District of Columbia residents seeking D.C. congressional voting rights.[24][71]\n\n\nIn *Hutchins v. District of Columbia* (1999), Garland concurred with four other D.C. Circuit judges (*en banc*) that D.C.'s Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 implicated at least some significant right of minors.[72] He joined parts of a plurality opinion written by Judge Laurence Silberman that upheld the juvenile curfew under intermediate scrutiny and a vagueness challenge. Garland also joined the part of Judge Judith W. Rogers's opinion (concurring in part and dissenting in part) holding that a fundamental right to intrastate travel exists.[73]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nGarland retired from federal judicial service on March 11, 2021, to accept appointment as the Attorney General of the United States.[40]\n\n\n\n## Supreme Court nomination[edit]\n\n\nGarland was considered twice to fill vacated seats on the United States Supreme Court in 2009 and 2010, before finally being nominated in 2016 by President Barack Obama for the seat left vacant by the death of conservative Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.[74]\n\n\n\n### 2009 and 2010 considerations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, following the announcement by Justice David Souter that he would retire, Garland was considered as one of nine finalists for the post, which ultimately went to Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge of the Second Circuit.[75]\n\n\nAfter the April 2010 announcement by Justice John Paul Stevens that he would retire, Garland was again widely seen as a leading contender for a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.[76][77][78] President Obama interviewed Garland, among others, for the vacancy.[48] In May 2010, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he would help Obama if Garland was nominated, calling Garland \"a consensus nominee\" and predicting that Garland would win Senate confirmation with bipartisan support.[79][80] Obama nominated Solicitor General of the United States Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August 2010.[48]\n\n\n\n### Scalia vacancy and 2016 nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Garland with President Barack Obama in 2016\nOn February 13, 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died.[81] Later that day, Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement that they would not consider any nominee put forth by Obama, and that a Supreme Court nomination should be left to the next president of the United States.[82][83][84] President Obama responded that he intended to \"fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court,\"[85][86] and that there was no \"well established tradition\" that a president could not fill a Supreme Court vacancy during their last year in office.[87]\n\n\nIn early March 2016, *The New York Times* reported that Garland was being vetted by the Obama administration as a potential nominee. A week later, Garland was named as one of three judges on the President's \"short list\" (along with Judge Sri Srinivasan, also of the D.C. Circuit, and Judge Paul J. Watford of the Ninth Circuit). Obama interviewed all three leading contenders, as well as two others who were being considered: Judge Jane L. Kelly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[88] Soon afterward, Senator Orrin Hatch, President pro tempore of the United States Senate and the most senior Republican Senator, predicted that President Obama would \"name someone the liberal Democratic base wants\" even though he \"could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.\"[89] Five days later, on March 16, Obama formally nominated Garland to the vacant post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.[90][91]\n\n\nGarland had more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history,[38] and was the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell Jr. in 1971.[92] The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Garland \"well-qualified\" (its highest rating) to sit on the Supreme Court.[93]\n\n\nUnder Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate's Republican majority refused to consider Garland's nomination, holding \"no hearings, no votes, no action whatsoever\" on the nomination.[94][95][96] McConnell's categorical refusal to hold hearings on Garland's nomination was described by political scientists and legal scholars as unprecedented,[95][97][98] McConnell's choice to lead a Republican blockade of the nomination was described as a \"culmination of [his] confrontational style,\"[99] and an example of constitutional hardball.[100] Yascha Mounk called it a \"blatant abuse of constitutional norms.\"[101]\n\n\nAfter a period of 293 days, Garland's nomination expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress.[102] It was the longest confirmation delay of a Supreme Court nominee in history, far exceeding the 125-day delay faced by the ultimately confirmed Justice Louis Brandeis in 1916.[103] On January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Court vacancy.[104] On April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n\n\nMcConnell went on to boast about stopping Garland's nomination, saying in August 2016, \"one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.'\"[105][106] In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act upon the Garland nomination was \"the most consequential decision I've made in my entire public career\".[107]\n\n\n\n## Attorney General (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garland is sworn in as Attorney General in March 2021.\nPresident-elect Joe Biden selected Garland for the position of United States attorney general, with news of the selection coming on January 6, 2021.[108][109] He was formally nominated by Biden on January 20, after Biden took office.[110] In Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, Garland vowed to oversee vigorous prosecution of those who stormed the United States Capitol, and other domestic extremists, drawing on his experience prosecuting the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City bombing.[111][112][113] Garland said it was likely the Biden administration would place a moratorium on use of the federal death penalty and expressed reservations about the death penalty in light of the \"almost randomness or arbitrariness of its application.\"[113] He pledged to protect equal justice under law and reinvigorate the DOJ Civil Rights Division, which, according to some media figures, languished under the Trump administration.[112][114] Garland affirmed that the Justice Department would remain independent under his leadership.[113] The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15–7 to advance Garland's nomination to the Senate floor,[115][116] and on March 10, the Senate confirmed Garland's nomination by a vote of 70–30.[117][111][118] He was sworn in on March 11, 2021, by Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus.[119]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Russia imposed sanctions against Garland, including prohibiting him from entering Russia. This was in retaliation for U.S. expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats, a sanction imposed by the United States against Russia for its SolarWinds hack, aggression against Ukraine, and interference in the 2020 U.S. election.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)Merrick Garland delivering remarks in the East Room of the White House, May 16, 2022,\nIn May 2021, the DOJ appealed in part a ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District Court for the District of Columbia to make public most of a DOJ memo detailing former Attorney General Bill Barr's legal rationale for clearing President Trump of obstruction of justice in the Special Counsel investigation.[121][122][123][124]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2021, the Justice Department continued its defense of a defamation lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, arguing that President Trump could not be sued because he had denied her rape allegation in offending statements in his presidential capacity. Garland had been deeply involved in the decision. The White House quickly distanced itself from the decision.[121][122][125] Garland in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on October 21 stated that the DOJ's briefing was solely on the question of the application of the Federal Tort Claims Act.[126][127]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2021, Garland imposed a moratorium on all federal executions pending a review of relevant policies and procedures.[128] The review will examine \"the risk of pain and suffering associated with the use of pentobarbital,\" \"regulations made in November 2020 that expanded the permissible methods of execution beyond lethal injection, and authorized the use of state facilities and personnel in federal executions\", and \"December 2020 and January 2021 changes to expedite execution of capital sentences.\"[128][129][130] This was consistent with Biden's pledge to push for legislation to end the federal death penalty. In spite of this, Garland has continued to pursue the death penalty in cases wherein a previous administration had sought the death penalty against a suspected terrorist.[131] The Trump administration resumed federal executions in 2019, and executed 13 inmates in total, the first in 17 years and including the first woman in 70 years.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garland with Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the U.S.-Mexico High-Level Security Dialogue in Washington, D.C., October 13, 2022.\nIn June 2021, Garland pledged to double the department's enforcement staff for protecting the right to vote, in response to Republican Party efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election,[132][133] The same month, Garland announced a DOJ lawsuit against the state of Georgia over its newly passed restrictions on voting; the DOJ complaint said that the state targeted Black Americans in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.[134]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the Justice Department released two guidance documents regarding election law changes and post-election audits, reminding states that the DOJ was closely observing states' compliance with federal election and civil rights laws.[121][135][136]\n\n\nIn November 2021, the DOJ sued Texas over Senate Bill 1 which required rejection of mail ballots \"for immaterial errors and omissions,\" alleging it would restrict voting for those with limited English proficiency, soldiers deployed and voters overseas.[137][138]\n\n\nIn a separate suit filed by DOJ against Texas the following month, the federal government alleged that Texas' redistricting plans discriminated against Latino and Black voters in violation of the Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.[139][140][141][142]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nDuring Garland's tenure as AG, the Justice Department has emphasized protection of civil rights.[143] Garland rescinded a Trump administration policy (imposed by Jeff Sessions) that curtailed DOJ investigations into police department misconduct (\"pattern-and-practice\" investigations) and restricted the use of consent decrees to reform police departments.[143][144][145]\n\n\n\n![](image)Garland meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, March 3, 2023\nOn April 21, 2021, Garland subsequently announced that the DOJ was opening a pattern-and-practice investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department after former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted for the murder of George Floyd, examining the use of force by officers and discriminatory conduct, its treatment of people with behavioral health issues, and the department's current accountability systems.[146] On April 26, Garland announced another investigation into the Louisville Metro Police Department in the aftermath of the killing of Breonna Taylor, examining the execution of search warrants.[147][148] On August 5, Garland opened another investigation into the Phoenix Police Department over its policies on dealing with the homeless.[149][150] On December 3, the DOJ opened another investigation into the Mount Vernon Police Department to assess if it engaged in discriminatory policing, involving its use of force, strip and body cavity searches, how it handles evidence, and its systems of accountability.[151][152]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the DOJ, through a memo issued by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, reversed a Trump-era policy that banned federal officers and agents from using body-worn cameras; the memo also mandated the use of body-worn cameras for federal law enforcement in certain circumstances (including when carrying out planned arrests or executing search warrants).[153][154][155]\n\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the DOJ announced a civil investigation into prisons in Georgia, focusing on prison violence and sexual abuse of LGBTQ prisoners by prisoners and staff, continuing with an initial investigation launched in 2016.[156][157][158]\n\n\nIn September, 2021, the DOJ in a memo limited the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints by federal officers during arrests, prohibiting such tactics unless deadly force is authorized (i.e., unless the officer reasonably believes \"that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person\"). The memo also limited the use of unannounced (\"no-knock\") entries when executing warrants, directing officers to knock-and-announce except \"where an agent has reasonable grounds to believe that knocking and announcing the agent’s presence would create an imminent threat of physical violence to the agent and/or another person.\"[159][160][161]\n\n\nOn October 13, 2021, the DOJ launched another investigation into five juvenile detention facilities in Texas for systemic physical or sexual abuse of children.[157][162]\n\n\n\n### January 6 U.S. Capitol attack[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: January 6 United States Capitol attack\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the DOJ sent letters to former DOJ officials of the Trump administration, including Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, Associate Deputy Attorney General Patrick Hovakimian, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Byung J. \"BJay\" Pak, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Bobby L. Christine, and United States Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division Jeffrey Clark.[163] The letters relayed that the DOJ would not exert executive privilege over their testimony as witnesses to Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election or the 2021 United States Capitol attack, and that they were free to provide \"unrestricted testimony\" and \"irrespective of potential privilege\" to the House Oversight Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee.[163][164][165][166]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2021, the DOJ further rejected Rep. Mo Brooks's request to protect him in Eric Swalwell's civil lawsuit against him and President Trump concerning his comments and actions in the attack. The DOJ in a court filing determined that Brooks' relevant comments and actions were outside the scope of his official responsibilities as a member of Congress.[167]\n\n\nOn October 21, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to refer Steve Bannon, the adviser to former President Donald Trump, to the DOJ for criminal contempt of Congress due to defying a subpoena from the House's January 6 select committee over claims of executive privilege. After Speaker Nancy Pelosi certified the contempt referral, it was sent to the U.S. Attorney for DC, who will then decide whether to send the referral to a grand jury for indictment, with Garland having the final say.[168] Garland told lawmakers that the Justice Department \"will apply the facts and the law and make a decision\" when considering a criminal contempt referral for Bannon. He stated that \"the Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances, we'll apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution.\"[126][127][168][169]\n\n\nIn November 2022, days after Trump announced his 2024 presidential campaign, Garland appointed Jack Smith to serve as special counsel for the investigations of Trump.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### School board memo[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2021, amid a surge of threats against school board members across the country, Garland issued a memorandum addressing an \"increase in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff\"; the memo directed the FBI and US attorneys' offices to set up meetings with federal, state and local law enforcement leaders for establishing tiplines for threat reporting and discussing strategies to address such threats.[172][173][126][174] He issued the memo soon after the National School Boards Association wrote to Biden to request a federal response to the protests and threats against school officials and investigations into whether they constituted as forms of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.[175][176][177][178]\n\n\nThe memo prompted criticism from Republicans in the House and Senate, who accused Garland of treating parents like domestic terrorists, although the memo did not mention either of them.[174] McConnell wrote to Garland that parents \"absolutely should be telling\" local schools what to teach regarding contentious public issues.[173][179] In House and Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, Garland pushed back on Republicans' claims that the DOJ were treating parents like \"domestic terrorists\" and investigating political speech, testifying that the DOJ \"[were] not investigating peaceful protest or parent involvement at school board meetings.\"[126][127][180][181] Numerous Senate Republicans called on Garland to resign over the memo.[182] Seventeen Republican state attorneys general led by Todd Rokita, and numerous House Republicans, separately wrote to Biden and Garland requesting the memorandum be immediately withdrawn.[174][178][180]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGarland and his wife, Lynn, were married at the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan in September 1987. Lynn Rosenman Garland's grandfather, Samuel Irving Rosenman, was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (a trial-level court) and a special counsel to presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and cum laude from Harvard University, and received a Master of Science degree in operations management from the MIT Sloan School of Management. Her father, Robert Rosenman, was a partner in the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore.[6] As of June 2018, she advised government and nonprofit groups on voting systems security and accuracy issues.[183] The couple lives together in Bethesda, Maryland.[184]\n\n\nGarland and his wife have two daughters, Rebecca and Jessica; both are graduates of Yale University.[185] Justice Elena Kagan hired Jessica Garland, a 2019 graduate of Yale Law School, as one of her law clerks in early July 2020, before Biden's election and Garland's appointment, to serve as a law clerk in 2022–2023. The Supreme Court said that \"in light of the potential for actual or apparent conflicts of interest,\" Jessica Garland will not serve as Kagan's law clerk while her father remains as attorney general.[186] Garland took part in the ceremony when his daughter Rebecca married Xan Tanner in June 2018.[183]\n\n\nFinancial disclosure forms in 2016 indicated that Garland's net worth at the time was between $6 million and $23M.[17] As of 2021, his net worth was estimated by *Forbes* at $8.6-33M.[187]\n\n\nGarland is red-green colorblind, so he uses a list to match his suits and ties.[17]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\n* Garland, Merrick B.

Haaland is a Native American and enrolled citizen of the Laguna Pueblo.\n\n\nHaaland's congressional district included most of Albuquerque and most of its suburbs. Along with Sharice Davids, she is one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress. She is a political progressive who supports the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.[3][4]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2020, then-President-elect Joe Biden announced that he would nominate Haaland to serve as Secretary of the Interior. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 15, 2021, by a vote of 51–40.[5] Following her swearing-in on March 16, she became the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and the second to serve in the Cabinet, after Republican former vice president and Kaw Nation citizen Charles Curtis.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHaaland was born in Winslow, Arizona.[8][9] She is an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo.[10] The Pueblo people have lived on the land that is now the state of New Mexico since the 1200s and Haaland identifies herself as a 35th-generation New Mexican.[11][12] Her mother, Mary Toya,[13] a Native American woman, served in the United States Navy and also worked in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.[14][15] Her father, Major John David \"Dutch\" Haaland, a Norwegian Minnesotan, was an officer in the United States Marine Corps and recipient of the Silver Star for his actions in Vietnam; he was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in 2005.[13][16][17] As a child in a military family, Haaland moved frequently.[18] She attended 13 public schools across the United States before the family settled in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to be close to family who also belong to the Laguna Pueblo.[19] Haaland graduated from Highland High School in Albuquerque.[18][19] She has two sisters, a brother, and two half-sisters.[13]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Highland High School, Haaland worked at a local bakery.[19] In 1988, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in English in 1994.[20][21] Her professors included future United States Poet Laureate Joy Harjo.[22] Four days after graduating, she gave birth to her child, Somáh.[18] As a single mother, Haaland started a salsa company to support herself and her child.[23][24] At times during this period, she has said, she did not earn enough money to afford housing and had to rely on friends for shelter.[18] She says she also relied on food stamps at times.[23] She earned her Juris Doctor in Indian law from the University of New Mexico School of Law in 2006, but is not a member of the New Mexico State Bar.[20][21][25] She is completing a Master's in American Indian studies at University of California, Los Angeles, while serving as secretary.[15]\n\n\nHaaland became the first chairwoman elected to the Laguna Development Corporation Board of Directors, a Laguna-owned business created to strengthen the Laguna Community and its economy.[19][26] As chairwoman, she oversaw business operations for the second-largest tribal gaming enterprise in New Mexico[27] and successfully advocated for the corporation to create policies and commitments to earth-friendly business practices.[27] She served as the tribal administrator for the San Felipe Pueblo from January 2013 to November 2015.[14][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Earlier political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Haaland served as the state's vote director for Native Americans in Barack Obama's 2012 presidential reelection campaign.[28] She served as the chair of Democratic Party of New Mexico Native American Caucus from 2012 to 2013.[11] She ran for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico in 2014.[14] Her ticket, headed by then-Attorney General of New Mexico Gary King, the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Mexico, lost to the Republican ticket of Governor Susana Martinez and Lieutenant Governor John Sanchez.[29][30]\n\n\nHaaland was elected to a two-year term as the chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico in April 2015.[31][32] During her tenure, New Mexico Democrats regained control of the New Mexico House of Representatives and the office of the New Mexico Secretary of State.[28][33] Haaland has been credited with rebuilding the state party after large defeats for Democrats in New Mexico in 2014.[34] She raised enough money during her two-year term as chair to pay off seven years' worth of debt incurred under previous chairs.[33]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Native Americans in the United States Congress\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nSee

term as state party chair, Haaland announced her intention to run for the United States House of Representatives in New Mexico's 1st congressional district in the 2018 elections, to succeed Michelle Lujan Grisham, who was running for governor.[28] Haaland defeated Damon Martinez and Antoinette Sedillo Lopez to win the Democratic Party nomination in June 2018,[35] receiving 40.5% of the vote and winning every county in the district.[36][37]\n\n\nIn the November 6 general election, Haaland defeated former New Mexico State Representative Janice Arnold-Jones,[38] receiving 59.1% of the vote and winning three of the district's five counties.[39][40] Her victory was part of a sweep of New Mexico that saw Democrats win every statewide and federal office on the ballot that year, along with expanding their majority in the New Mexico House of Representatives.[41][42]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in New Mexico § District 1\n\nIn the November 3 general election, Haaland received 58.2% of the vote defeating retired police detective Michelle Garcia Holmes, who ran for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico in the 2018 gubernatorial election.[43]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Congresswoman Deb Haaland (D-NM), is sworn in to the House of Representatives by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accompanied by her mother Mary Toya and her child Somáh.\n![](image)A wet-plate collodion photograph of Haaland in 2019\nWith Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Minnesota, elected simultaneously, Haaland was one of the first two Native American women to be seated in Congress.[44][45][46] During the swearing-in ceremony in January 2019, Haaland wore traditional Pueblo dress, necklace and moccasins.[47]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2019, during a debate on voting rights and campaign finance, Haaland became the first Native American woman to preside over the U.S. House of Representatives.[48][49]\n\n\nHaaland served as one of three co-chairs of Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign.[50]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed

2020, incoming President Joe Biden announced that he would nominate Haaland as Secretary of the Interior.[56] Before Biden nominated Haaland, many senior Democrats had voiced their support for her as Secretary of the Interior, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Republican representatives Don Young and Tom Cole (a member of the Chickasaw Nation) also expressed their support for Haaland's nomination.[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haaland sworn in as Secretary of the Interior by Vice President Kamala Harris.\nOn March 15, 2021, Haaland was confirmed by the Senate 51–40, with four Republicans (Collins, Murkowski, Sullivan, Graham) voting to confirm.[5][60] She is the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history.[a][61][62][63] Her departure from the House triggered a special election in 2021. Haaland was sworn in on March 18, 2021, wearing a combination of traditional Laguna Pueblo regalia and a colorful ribbon skirt, custom-made for her by Agnes Woodward.[64] She has brought Indigenous traditions to the role, often wearing Native jewelry and decorating her office with Native art.[15]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deb Haaland on 20 February 2023\nOn her first day as secretary, Haaland met with tribal media in a press conference organized by the department and the Native American Journalists Association, speaking about her intention to include the tribes as decisions that impact them are made.[65] In April 2021, Haaland announced a new unit within Bureau of Indian Affairs that plans to tackle the decades-long crisis of missing and murdered Native Americans, saying, \"We are fully committed to assisting Tribal communities with these investigations, and the MMU will leverage every resource available to be a force-multiplier in preventing these cases from becoming cold case investigations\".[66]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Haaland approved the new constitution of the Cherokee Nation with protections for Cherokee Freedmen.[67]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Haaland announced the creation of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative. The initiative's goal is to investigate long-standing abuse in the now defunct residential boarding schools that housed Native American children under the 1819 Civilization Fund Act.[68][69] Haaland attended a series of Road to Healing events to bring together survivors and their stories.[15] Haaland's grandparents had also been sent to the boarding schools.[15]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Haaland banned the word \"squaw\", a derogatory term for Native American women, from all federally owned lands, and ordered a task force to determine new names for the 650 places that currently use the word.[70][71]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Haaland announced $25 million to be dedicated to bison conservation.[72]\n\n\nHaaland was involved in President Biden's designation of national monuments, including Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.[73][74]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018 New Mexico's 1st congressional district election[75][76]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Debra Haaland**  | **25,444**  | **40.59**  |\n|  | Democratic | Damon Martinez | 16,182\n | 25.81\n |\n|  | Democratic | Antoinette Sedillo Lopez | 12,919\n | 20.61\n |\n|  | Democratic | Paul Moya\n | 3,691\n | 5.89\n |\n|  | Democratic | *Pat Davis (withdrawn)* | 2,385\n | 3.80\n |\n|  | Democratic | Damian Lara\n | 2,063\n | 3.29\n |\n|  | Democratic | Jesse Andrew Heitner (write-in)\n | 3\n | 0.00\n |\n| Total votes\n | **62,687**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Deb Haaland**  | **147,336**  | **59.13**  |\n|  | Republican | Janice Arnold-Jones | 90,507\n | 36.32\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Lloyd Princeton\n | 11,319\n | 4.54\n |\n| Total votes\n | **249,162**  | **100**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n2020 New Mexico's 1st congressional district election[77][78]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Debra Haaland (incumbent)**  | **83,032**  | **100.00**  |\n| Total votes\n | **83,032**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Deb Haaland (incumbent)**  | **186,953**  | **58.19**  |\n|  | Republican | Michelle Garcia Holmes\n | 134,337\n | 41.81\n |\n| Total votes\n | **321,290**  | **100**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHaaland has a child, Somáh, whom she raised as a single mother.[28][79] Her hobbies include marathon running and gourmet cooking.[20] Haaland is Catholic.[80] On August 28, 2021, Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, in Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico.[81][82]\n\n\nHaaland suffered a broken left fibula on July 17, 2022, while hiking in Shenandoah National Park.[83]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Native American politicians\n* List of Native Americans in the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* List of secretaries of the interior\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Charles Curtis, who was a Kaw citizen and served as Vice President between 1929 and 1933, was the first ever Native American to serve in a United States Cabinet, but never served as a Cabinet secretary.[61]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As pronounced by Haaland in her speech to the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n2. **^** \"Secretary Deb Haaland\".

Haaland is a Native American and enrolled citizen of the Laguna Pueblo.\n\n\nHaaland's congressional district included most of Albuquerque and most of its suburbs. Along with Sharice Davids, she is one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress. She is a political progressive who supports the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.[3][4]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2020, then-President-elect Joe Biden announced that he would nominate Haaland to serve as Secretary of the Interior. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 15, 2021, by a vote of 51–40.[5] Following her swearing-in on March 16, she became the first Native American to serve as a Cabinet secretary and the second to serve in the Cabinet, after Republican former vice president and Kaw Nation citizen Charles Curtis.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHaaland was born in Winslow, Arizona.[8][9] She is an enrolled member of the Laguna Pueblo.[10] The Pueblo people have lived on the land that is now the state of New Mexico since the 1200s and Haaland identifies herself as a 35th-generation New Mexican.[11][12] Her mother, Mary Toya,[13] a Native American woman, served in the United States Navy and also worked in the Bureau of Indian Affairs.[14][15] Her father, Major John David \"Dutch\" Haaland, a Norwegian Minnesotan, was an officer in the United States Marine Corps and recipient of the Silver Star for his actions in Vietnam; he was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery in 2005.[13][16][17] As a child in a military family, Haaland moved frequently.[18] She attended 13 public schools across the United States before the family settled in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to be close to family who also belong to the Laguna Pueblo.[19] Haaland graduated from Highland High School in Albuquerque.[18][19] She has two sisters, a brother, and two half-sisters.[13]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Highland High School, Haaland worked at a local bakery.[19] In 1988, she enrolled at the University of New Mexico, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts in English in 1994.[20][21] Her professors included future United States Poet Laureate Joy Harjo.[22] Four days after graduating, she gave birth to her child, Somáh.[18] As a single mother, Haaland started a salsa company to support herself and her child.[23][24] At times during this period, she has said, she did not earn enough money to afford housing and had to rely on friends for shelter.[18] She says she also relied on food stamps at times.[23] She earned her Juris Doctor in Indian law from the University of New Mexico School of Law in 2006, but is not a member of the New Mexico State Bar.[20][21][25] She is completing a Master's in American Indian studies at University of California, Los Angeles, while serving as secretary.[15]\n\n\nHaaland became the first chairwoman elected to the Laguna Development Corporation Board of Directors, a Laguna-owned business created to strengthen the Laguna Community and its economy.[19][26] As chairwoman, she oversaw business operations for the second-largest tribal gaming enterprise in New Mexico[27] and successfully advocated for the corporation to create policies and commitments to earth-friendly business practices.[27] She served as the tribal administrator for the San Felipe Pueblo from January 2013 to November 2015.[14][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Earlier political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Haaland served as the state's vote director for Native Americans in Barack Obama's 2012 presidential reelection campaign.[28] She served as the chair of Democratic Party of New Mexico Native American Caucus from 2012 to 2013.[11] She ran for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico in 2014.[14] Her ticket, headed by then-Attorney General of New Mexico Gary King, the Democratic nominee for Governor of New Mexico, lost to the Republican ticket of Governor Susana Martinez and Lieutenant Governor John Sanchez.[29][30]\n\n\nHaaland was elected to a two-year term as the chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico in April 2015.[31][32] During her tenure, New Mexico Democrats regained control of the New Mexico House of Representatives and the office of the New Mexico Secretary of State.[28][33] Haaland has been credited with rebuilding the state party after large defeats for Democrats in New Mexico in 2014.[34] She raised enough money during her two-year term as chair to pay off seven years' worth of debt incurred under previous chairs.[33]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Native Americans in the United States Congress\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nSee

term as state party chair, Haaland announced her intention to run for the United States House of Representatives in New Mexico's 1st congressional district in the 2018 elections, to succeed Michelle Lujan Grisham, who was running for governor.[28] Haaland defeated Damon Martinez and Antoinette Sedillo Lopez to win the Democratic Party nomination in June 2018,[35] receiving 40.5% of the vote and winning every county in the district.[36][37]\n\n\nIn the November 6 general election, Haaland defeated former New Mexico State Representative Janice Arnold-Jones,[38] receiving 59.1% of the vote and winning three of the district's five counties.[39][40] Her victory was part of a sweep of New Mexico that saw Democrats win every statewide and federal office on the ballot that year, along with expanding their majority in the New Mexico House of Representatives.[41][42]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in New Mexico § District 1\n\nIn the November 3 general election, Haaland received 58.2% of the vote defeating retired police detective Michelle Garcia Holmes, who ran for Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico in the 2018 gubernatorial election.[43]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Congresswoman Deb Haaland (D-NM), is sworn in to the House of Representatives by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, accompanied by her mother Mary Toya and her child Somáh.\n![](image)A wet-plate collodion photograph of Haaland in 2019\nWith Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation of Minnesota, elected simultaneously, Haaland was one of the first two Native American women to be seated in Congress.[44][45][46] During the swearing-in ceremony in January 2019, Haaland wore traditional Pueblo dress, necklace and moccasins.[47]\n\n\nOn March 7, 2019, during a debate on voting rights and campaign finance, Haaland became the first Native American woman to preside over the U.S. House of Representatives.[48][49]\n\n\nHaaland served as one of three co-chairs of Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign.[50]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed

Congressional Native American Caucus (Co-chair)[54]\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus[55]\n\n\n## Secretary of the Interior[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2020, incoming President Joe Biden announced that he would nominate Haaland as Secretary of the Interior.[56] Before Biden nominated Haaland, many senior Democrats had voiced their support for her as Secretary of the Interior, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, and Senator Elizabeth Warren. Republican representatives Don Young and Tom Cole (a member of the Chickasaw Nation) also expressed their support for Haaland's nomination.[57][58][59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haaland sworn in as Secretary of the Interior by Vice President Kamala Harris.\nOn March 15, 2021, Haaland was confirmed by the Senate 51–40, with four Republicans (Collins, Murkowski, Sullivan, Graham) voting to confirm.[5][60] She is the first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history.[a][61][62][63] Her departure from the House triggered a special election in 2021. Haaland was sworn in on March 18, 2021, wearing a combination of traditional Laguna Pueblo regalia and a colorful ribbon skirt, custom-made for her by Agnes Woodward.[64] She has brought Indigenous traditions to the role, often wearing Native jewelry and decorating her office with Native art.[15]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deb Haaland on 20 February 2023\nOn her first day as secretary, Haaland met with tribal media in a press conference organized by the department and the Native American Journalists Association, speaking about her intention to include the tribes as decisions that impact them are made.[65] In April 2021, Haaland announced a new unit within Bureau of Indian Affairs that plans to tackle the decades-long crisis of missing and murdered Native Americans, saying, \"We are fully committed to assisting Tribal communities with these investigations, and the MMU will leverage every resource available to be a force-multiplier in preventing these cases from becoming cold case investigations\".[66]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Haaland approved the new constitution of the Cherokee Nation with protections for Cherokee Freedmen.[67]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Haaland announced the creation of the Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative. The initiative's goal is to investigate long-standing abuse in the now defunct residential boarding schools that housed Native American children under the 1819 Civilization Fund Act.[68][69] Haaland attended a series of Road to Healing events to bring together survivors and their stories.[15] Haaland's grandparents had also been sent to the boarding schools.[15]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Haaland banned the word \"squaw\", a derogatory term for Native American women, from all federally owned lands, and ordered a task force to determine new names for the 650 places that currently use the word.[70][71]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Haaland announced $25 million to be dedicated to bison conservation.[72]\n\n\nHaaland was involved in President Biden's designation of national monuments, including Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni – Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon National Monument.[73][74]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018 New Mexico's 1st congressional district election[75][76]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Debra Haaland**  | **25,444**  | **40.59**  |\n|  | Democratic | Damon Martinez | 16,182\n | 25.81\n |\n|  | Democratic | Antoinette Sedillo Lopez | 12,919\n | 20.61\n |\n|  | Democratic | Paul Moya\n | 3,691\n | 5.89\n |\n|  | Democratic | *Pat Davis (withdrawn)* | 2,385\n | 3.80\n |\n|  | Democratic | Damian Lara\n | 2,063\n | 3.29\n |\n|  | Democratic | Jesse Andrew Heitner (write-in)\n | 3\n | 0.00\n |\n| Total votes\n | **62,687**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Deb Haaland**  | **147,336**  | **59.13**  |\n|  | Republican | Janice Arnold-Jones | 90,507\n | 36.32\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Lloyd Princeton\n | 11,319\n | 4.54\n |\n| Total votes\n | **249,162**  | **100**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n2020 New Mexico's 1st congressional district election[77][78]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Debra Haaland (incumbent)**  | **83,032**  | **100.00**  |\n| Total votes\n | **83,032**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Deb Haaland (incumbent)**  | **186,953**  | **58.19**  |\n|  | Republican | Michelle Garcia Holmes\n | 134,337\n | 41.81\n |\n| Total votes\n | **321,290**  | **100**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHaaland has a child, Somáh, whom she raised as a single mother.[28][79] Her hobbies include marathon running and gourmet cooking.[20] Haaland is Catholic.[80] On August 28, 2021, Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, in Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico.[81][82]\n\n\nHaaland suffered a broken left fibula on July 17, 2022, while hiking in Shenandoah National Park.[83]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Native American politicians\n* List of Native Americans in the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* List of secretaries of the interior\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Charles Curtis, who was a Kaw citizen and served as Vice President between 1929 and 1933, was the first ever Native American to serve in a United States Cabinet, but never served as a Cabinet secretary.[61]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As pronounced by Haaland in her speech to the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\n2. **^** \"Secretary Deb Haaland\".

He previously served in the role from 2009 to 2017 during the Obama administration. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 40th governor of Iowa from 1999 to 2007.\n\n\nOn November 30, 2006, he formally launched his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election, but ended his bid on February 23, 2007.[1] President-elect Barack Obama announced Vilsack's selection to be Secretary of Agriculture on December 17, 2008. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009. Until his January 13, 2017 resignation[2] one week prior to the end of Obama's second term as president, he had been the only member of the U.S. Cabinet who had served since the day Obama originally took office. As of the end of that term[update] he was the fourth-longest-serving holder of the office.[3]\n\n\nOn July 19, 2016, *The Washington Post* reported that Vilsack was on Hillary Clinton's two-person shortlist to be her running mate for that year's presidential election. U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia was ultimately selected.[4] On December 10, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Vilsack to once again serve as secretary of agriculture in the incoming Biden administration.[5][3] Vilsack was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 23, 2021, by a vote of 92–7.[6] Vilsack is the second-longest serving Secretary of Agriculture in American history.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nVilsack was born on December 13, 1950, in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his 23-year-old birth mother (a secretary) had lived since September 1950 under the pseudonym of \"Gloria\"; he was baptized as \"Kenneth\".[7] He was adopted in 1951 by Bud, a real-estate agent and insurance salesman, and Dolly Vilsack. They named him Thomas James.\n\n\nVilsack attended Shady Side Academy, a preparatory high school in Pittsburgh. He received a bachelor's degree in 1972 from Hamilton College. While at Hamilton, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He received a Juris Doctor from Albany Law School in 1975.\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Vilsack raised funds to rebuild an athletic facility for young people; in a 2016 interview, he describes himself \"as the Jerry Lewis of Mount Pleasant for a couple days\" when he hosted a pledge drive on the local radio station to raise the funds.[8] This led him to involvement in the local Chamber of Commerce and United Way. He and his wife volunteered in the failed 1988 presidential campaign of then senator Joe Biden.\n\n\nAfter the mayor of Mount Pleasant was gunned down in December 1986, Vilsack led a fundraising drive to build a memorial fountain.[9] The deceased mayor's father asked Vilsack to run for mayor of Mount Pleasant; he was elected and began serving in 1987.[10] He was elected to the Iowa Senate in 1992.[10] Following his election, he worked on legislation requiring companies who received state tax incentives to provide better pay and benefits. He helped pass a law for workers to receive health coverage when changing jobs and helped redesign Iowa's Workforce Development Department. He also wrote a bill to have the State of Iowa assume a 50% share of local county mental health costs.\n\n\n\n## Governor of Iowa[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Terry Branstad chose not to seek re-election after 16 years as governor. The Iowa Republican Party nominated Jim Ross Lightfoot, a former U.S. Representative. Vilsack defeated former Iowa Supreme Court Justice Mark McCormick in the Democratic primary and chose Sally Pederson as his running mate. Lightfoot was the odds-on favorite to succeed Branstad and polls consistently showed him in the lead.[11] However, Vilsack narrowly won the general election and became the first Democrat to serve as governor of Iowa in thirty years and only the fifth Democrat to hold the office in the 20th century.\n\n\nDuring the 2000 contest for the Democratic presidential nomination between Vice President Al Gore and former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, he remained neutral.[12]\n\n\nIn 2002 he won his second term in office by defeating Republican challenger attorney Doug Gross by eight percentage points.[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)Governor Tom Vilsack in 2008\nIn the first year of his second term, Vilsack used a line-item veto, later ruled unconstitutional by the Iowa Supreme Court, to create the Grow Iowa Values Fund, a $503 million appropriation designed to boost the Iowa economy by offering grants to corporations and initiatives pledged to create higher-income jobs. He vetoed portions of the bill that would have cut income taxes and eased business regulations. After a special session of the Iowa General Assembly on September 7, 2004, $100 million in state money was set aside to honor previously made commitments. The Grow Iowa Values Fund was reinstated at the end of the 2005 session: under the current law, $50 million per year will be set aside over the next ten years.\n\n\nFor most of Vilsack's tenure as governor, Republicans held effective majorities in the Iowa General Assembly. Following the November 2, 2004, elections, the fifty-member Senate was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, and Republicans held a 51–49 majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\nIn July 2005, Vilsack signed an executive order allowing all felons who had served their sentences to vote.[14] Approximately 115,000 felons regained their voting rights.[15] He said: \"When you've paid your debt to society, you need to be reconnected and re-engaged to society.\" Previously, convicted felons were disenfranchised, but could petition the governor to initiate a process, normally requiring six months, to restore their right to vote.[16]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 legislative session, Vilsack signed legislation designed to reduce methamphetamine use. It imposed greater restrictions on products containing the active ingredient pseudoephedrine, requiring them to be sold behind pharmacy counters rather than via open-access. It required purchasers to show identification and sign a logbook. It took effect on May 21, 2005.\n\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in *Kelo v. City of New London* in June 2005, Vilsack vetoed a bill to restrict Iowa's use of eminent domain, citing its potential for negative impact on job creation. He said: \"You have an interesting balance between job growth, which everybody supports, and restricting the power of government, which a lot of people support.\"[17] His veto was overridden by the legislature.\n\n\nVilsack is a former member of the National Governors Association Executive Committee. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2004. He was also chair of the Governors Biotechnology Partnership, the Governors Ethanol Coalition, and the Midwest Governors Conference, and has also been chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association's committee on Natural Resources, where he worked to develop the NGA's farm and energy policies.[18]\n\n\nVilsack was thought to be high on the list of potential running mates for Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.[19] In 2005, Vilsack established Heartland PAC, a political action committee aimed at electing Democratic governors. In the first report, he raised over half a million dollars. Vilsack left office in 2007; he did not seek a third term and was succeeded by Chet Culver.\n\n\n\n## 2008 U.S. presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tom Vilsack 2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn November 30, 2006, Tom Vilsack became the second Democrat (after Mike Gravel) to officially announce intentions to run for the presidency in the 2008 election. In his announcement speech, he said \"America's a great country, and now I have the opportunity to begin the process, the legal process of filing papers to run for President of the United States.\" Vilsack dropped out of the race on February 23, 2007, citing monetary constraints.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack's campaign logo\nVilsack's campaign made significant use of social media by maintaining an active MySpace profile, a collection of viral video clips on YouTube, a Facebook profile, videoblog on blip.tv,[21] and a conference call with the podcast site TalkShoe.[22] On January 27, 2007, Vilsack called into the Regular Guys Show hosted by Kurt Hurner to conduct a 15‑minute interview on his running for the Democratic nomination for 2008. Since then, Vilsack appeared again on the show, now The Kurt Hurner Show at Talk Shoe on August 12, 2008, this time as a supporter of Barack Obama for president taking questions from callers to the program for 30 minutes.\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Vilsack joined fellow candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in supporting the establishment of a U.S. Public Service Academy as a civilian counterpart to the military academies.[23]\n\n\nShortly after ending his 2008 bid for the White House, Vilsack endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton and was named the national co-chair for Clinton's presidential campaign.[24]\n\n\n\n### Views on Iraq[edit]\n\n\nVilsack was critical of President Bush's execution of the war in Iraq, but he hesitated to call for an immediate and complete pullout of U.S. forces: \"I don't think we're losing in Iraq. It appears to be a draw. People are upset by the fact that their kids are over there and there doesn't seem to be any end to this whole process. It's not pacifism that makes people think this way. They're questioning the credibility and competence of the Commander-in-Chief.\"[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack announces his withdrawal from the 2008 presidential race\nOn December 5, Vilsack announced that he favored withdrawing most U.S. forces from Iraq and leaving a small force in the northern region for a limited period. He said U.S. forces provided the Iraqi government with \"both a crutch and an excuse\" for inaction. He said U.S. withdrawal \"may very well require them to go through some chaotic and very difficult times\", but that he believed it the only way to force the Iraqi government to take control of the country.[26]\n\n\n\n### Views on energy security[edit]\n\n\nThe Vilsack Energy Security Agenda set out a strategy to dramatically reduce U.S. reliance on foreign energy and to cut the United States' carbon emissions. It also called for replacing the Department of Energy with a new Department of Energy Security, to oversee and redefine the federal government's role in energy policy. The reorganized department would have acted as an institutional advocate for innovation in energy policy and was intended to ensure accountability as the nation works towards achieving its energy security goals. Through this new department, America's overriding objective in energy policy would have been to make America the unquestioned leader in clean energy, enhancing national security and economic strength.[27]\n\n\nIn a 2007 lecture to the Commonwealth Club of California, Vilsack stated:[28]\n\n\n\n\n> Iowa is one of the nation's leading producers of corn-based ethanol, and many people in my state have an economic stake in the expanded use of corn-based ethanol. But the reality is that corn-based ethanol will never be enough to reach our goals. Some have suggested that we import more sugar-based ethanol from Brazil and we should indeed consider all sources of available ethanol ... but if we are going to create energy security we can't simply replace one imported source of energy with another. That alone is not security ... the only way we can produce enough domestically is if we greatly improve the technology used to produce cellulosic ethanol.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Secretary of Agriculture (2009–2017)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack's 2009 official portrait during his first tenure as Agriculture secretary\n![](image)Vilsack introduces President Barack Obama at the Northeast Iowa Community College, for a White House Rural Economic Forum on August 16, 2011.\nOn December 17, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Vilsack as the nominee to be the 30th Secretary of Agriculture.[29] Vilsack has governed a largely agricultural state as did the previous two Secretaries of Agriculture, Mike Johanns (who was later a United States Senator from Nebraska) (2005–2007) and Ed Schafer (2007–2009).\n\n\nThe Senate confirmed Vilsack's nomination for the position by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009.[30]\n\n\nReaction to Vilsack's nomination from agricultural groups was largely positive and included endorsements from the Corn Refiners Association, the National Grain and Feed Association, the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the Environmental Defense Fund.[31] Vilsack was the founder and former chair of the Governor's Biotechnology Partnership, and was named Governor of the Year by the Biotechnology Industry Organization, an industry lobbying group.[32]\n\n\n\n### Actions[edit]\n\n\nVilsack appointed Shirley Sherrod as the Georgia Director of Rural Development, saying she would be an \"important advocate on behalf of rural communities\".[33] Months after the appointment, Vilsack forced her to resign based on accusations of considering race in the handling of her job responsibilities at a private advocacy firm in 1986.[34] Subsequent reports claimed that Vilsack had overreacted to a selectively edited tape of a speech that Sherrod had given to the NAACP. The edited tape had been posted online by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart.[35] Vilsack expressed his \"deep regret\" to Sherrod in acting hastily.[36]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2012, Obama appointed Vilsack the designated survivor during the President's State of the Union address.[37]\n\n\n\n### Beef advocacy[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Vilsack joined three midwest governors in a campaign to defend the use of a processed beef product made from trimmings left after beef carcasses are butchered, dubbed \"pink slime\" by its critics. He said \"it's safe, it contains less fat and historically it's been less expensive\" and that it should be available to consumers and school districts that want to buy it.[38]\n\n\n\n### Global warming[edit]\n\n\nAt a Drake University forum on climate change April 22, 2014, Vilsack stated \"agriculture tends to take the brunt of criticism about climate change, but the industry contributes only 9 percent of the greenhouse gases blamed for a warming planet\" and that while there were \"challenges globally in terms of agriculture and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions that's not necessarily the case in the United States.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Considered resignation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Vilsack told President Obama he was considering resigning from his position. *The Washington Post* reported that he said, \"There are days when I have literally nothing to do\" as he weighed his decision to quit.[40] Obama asked Vilsack to remain in his position and asked him to look into the problem of opioid addiction.[40]\n\n\n\n## Between cabinet tenures[edit]\n\n\nShortly after his tenure ended, Vilsack released a statement in support of his succession by Sonny Perdue as the Secretary of Agriculture, making Perdue the only cabinet member nominee to receive a public statement of support from an Obama cabinet member.[41] He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the United States Senate in 2020, for the seat currently held by Republican incumbent Joni Ernst,[42] but subsequently declined to run.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Vilsack became president and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council.[44]\n\n\nVilsack endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[45]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Agriculture (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack is sworn in for the second time as agriculture secretary by Vice President Kamala Harris, February 24, 2021.\n### Nomination and confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Biden announced he would nominate Vilsack to again serve as the Secretary of Agriculture.[46] The move was met by some with criticism from black farmers and progressives, because of Vilsack's perceived relationship with status quo and corporate agriculture.[47][48][49] He appeared before the Senate Agriculture Committee on February 2, 2021, and was unanimously approved.[50] His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on February 23, 2021, by a 92–7 vote.[51] He was sworn into office by Vice President Kamala Harris on February 24, 2021.[52]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Vilsack announced that the USDA would leverage $100 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to expand America's meat processing capacity.[53][54]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nVilsack met his wife, Ann Christine \"Christie\" Bell, in a cafeteria while at Hamilton College in New York in October 1968. Vilsack approached her and asked, \"Are you a Humphrey or a Nixon supporter?\" She replied \"Humphrey\" and they soon began dating. On August 18, 1973, the couple was married in Christie Vilsack's hometown of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Vilsack and his wife moved to Mount Pleasant in 1975, where he joined his father-in-law's law practice.[10]\n\n\nTom and Christie Vilsack have two sons, Jess and Doug.[55]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Vilsack's six-year-old granddaughter, Ella, died of complications from influenza.[56]\n\n\nVilsack won $150,000 in the Powerball in 2020.[57]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n* **1992 election for Iowa State Senate, 49th District:**\n\n\n**Democratic Primary**[58]\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 100.0%\n\n**1992 General Election:[59]**\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 50.1% – 12,544 votes\n* Dave Heaton (R), 42.1% – 10,551 votes\n* Dan Reed (I), 7.8% – 1,945 votes\n\n* **1994 election for Iowa State Senate, 49th District:**\n\n\n**Democratic Primary**[60]\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 99.9% – 1,201 votes\n* *scattering*, 0.1% – 1 vote\n\n**1994 General Election:[61]**\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 98.8% – 12,288 votes\n* *scattering*, 1.2% – 145 votes\n\n* \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic primary results[62]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack**  | **59,130**  | **51.20**  |\n|  | Democratic | Mark McCormick\n | 55,950\n | 48.45\n |\n|  | Democratic | Write-ins\n | 410\n | 0.36\n |\n| Total votes\n | **115,490**  | **100.00**  |\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa gubernatorial election, 1998[63]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack**  | **500,231**  | **52.30%**  | **+10.74%**  |\n|  | Republican | Jim Ross Lightfoot | 444,787\n | 46.51%\n | -10.29%\n |\n|  | Reform | Jim Hennager\n | 5,606\n | 0.59%\n |  |\n|  | Natural Law | Jim Schaefer\n | 3,144\n | 0.33%\n | -0.05%\n |\n|  | Independent | Mark Kennis\n | 2,006\n | 0.21%\n |  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 641\n | 0.07%\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 55,444\n | 5.80%\n | -9.44%\n |\n| Turnout | 956,415\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic primary results[64]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack (incumbent)**  | **79,277**  | **98.55**  |\n|  | Democratic | Write-ins\n | 1,166\n | 1.45\n |\n| Total votes\n | **80,443**  | **100**  |\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa gubernatorial election, 2002[65]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack (incumbent)**  | **540,449**  | **52.69%**  | **+0.39%**  |\n|  | Republican | Doug Gross\n | 456,612\n | 44.51%\n | -2.00%\n |\n|  | Green | Jay Robinson\n | 14,628\n | 1.43%\n |  |\n|  | Libertarian | Clyde Cleveland\n | 13,098\n | 1.28%\n |  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 1,025\n | 0.10%\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 83,837\n | 8.17%\n | +2.37%\n |\n| Turnout | 1,025,802\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of United States Cabinet members who have served more than eight years\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pindel, James W.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 40th governor of Iowa from 1999 to 2007.\n\n\nOn November 30, 2006, he formally launched his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election, but ended his bid on February 23, 2007.[1] President-elect Barack Obama announced Vilsack's selection to be Secretary of Agriculture on December 17, 2008. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009. Until his January 13, 2017 resignation[2] one week prior to the end of Obama's second term as president, he had been the only member of the U.S. Cabinet who had served since the day Obama originally took office. As of the end of that term[update] he was the fourth-longest-serving holder of the office.[3]\n\n\nOn July 19, 2016, *The Washington Post* reported that Vilsack was on Hillary Clinton's two-person shortlist to be her running mate for that year's presidential election. U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia was ultimately selected.[4] On December 10, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Vilsack to once again serve as secretary of agriculture in the incoming Biden administration.[5][3] Vilsack was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 23, 2021, by a vote of 92–7.[6] Vilsack is the second-longest serving Secretary of Agriculture in American history.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nVilsack was born on December 13, 1950, in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his 23-year-old birth mother (a secretary) had lived since September 1950 under the pseudonym of \"Gloria\"; he was baptized as \"Kenneth\".[7] He was adopted in 1951 by Bud, a real-estate agent and insurance salesman, and Dolly Vilsack. They named him Thomas James.\n\n\nVilsack attended Shady Side Academy, a preparatory high school in Pittsburgh. He received a bachelor's degree in 1972 from Hamilton College. While at Hamilton, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He received a Juris Doctor from Albany Law School in 1975.\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nIn Mount Pleasant, Vilsack raised funds to rebuild an athletic facility for young people; in a 2016 interview, he describes himself \"as the Jerry Lewis of Mount Pleasant for a couple days\" when he hosted a pledge drive on the local radio station to raise the funds.[8] This led him to involvement in the local Chamber of Commerce and United Way. He and his wife volunteered in the failed 1988 presidential campaign of then senator Joe Biden.\n\n\nAfter the mayor of Mount Pleasant was gunned down in December 1986, Vilsack led a fundraising drive to build a memorial fountain.[9] The deceased mayor's father asked Vilsack to run for mayor of Mount Pleasant; he was elected and began serving in 1987.[10] He was elected to the Iowa Senate in 1992.[10] Following his election, he worked on legislation requiring companies who received state tax incentives to provide better pay and benefits. He helped pass a law for workers to receive health coverage when changing jobs and helped redesign Iowa's Workforce Development Department. He also wrote a bill to have the State of Iowa assume a 50% share of local county mental health costs.\n\n\n\n## Governor of Iowa[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Terry Branstad chose not to seek re-election after 16 years as governor. The Iowa Republican Party nominated Jim Ross Lightfoot, a former U.S. Representative. Vilsack defeated former Iowa Supreme Court Justice Mark McCormick in the Democratic primary and chose Sally Pederson as his running mate. Lightfoot was the odds-on favorite to succeed Branstad and polls consistently showed him in the lead.[11] However, Vilsack narrowly won the general election and became the first Democrat to serve as governor of Iowa in thirty years and only the fifth Democrat to hold the office in the 20th century.\n\n\nDuring the 2000 contest for the Democratic presidential nomination between Vice President Al Gore and former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, he remained neutral.[12]\n\n\nIn 2002 he won his second term in office by defeating Republican challenger attorney Doug Gross by eight percentage points.[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)Governor Tom Vilsack in 2008\nIn the first year of his second term, Vilsack used a line-item veto, later ruled unconstitutional by the Iowa Supreme Court, to create the Grow Iowa Values Fund, a $503 million appropriation designed to boost the Iowa economy by offering grants to corporations and initiatives pledged to create higher-income jobs. He vetoed portions of the bill that would have cut income taxes and eased business regulations. After a special session of the Iowa General Assembly on September 7, 2004, $100 million in state money was set aside to honor previously made commitments. The Grow Iowa Values Fund was reinstated at the end of the 2005 session: under the current law, $50 million per year will be set aside over the next ten years.\n\n\nFor most of Vilsack's tenure as governor, Republicans held effective majorities in the Iowa General Assembly. Following the November 2, 2004, elections, the fifty-member Senate was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, and Republicans held a 51–49 majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\nIn July 2005, Vilsack signed an executive order allowing all felons who had served their sentences to vote.[14] Approximately 115,000 felons regained their voting rights.[15] He said: \"When you've paid your debt to society, you need to be reconnected and re-engaged to society.\" Previously, convicted felons were disenfranchised, but could petition the governor to initiate a process, normally requiring six months, to restore their right to vote.[16]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 legislative session, Vilsack signed legislation designed to reduce methamphetamine use. It imposed greater restrictions on products containing the active ingredient pseudoephedrine, requiring them to be sold behind pharmacy counters rather than via open-access. It required purchasers to show identification and sign a logbook. It took effect on May 21, 2005.\n\n\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court decision in *Kelo v. City of New London* in June 2005, Vilsack vetoed a bill to restrict Iowa's use of eminent domain, citing its potential for negative impact on job creation. He said: \"You have an interesting balance between job growth, which everybody supports, and restricting the power of government, which a lot of people support.\"[17] His veto was overridden by the legislature.\n\n\nVilsack is a former member of the National Governors Association Executive Committee. He was chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2004. He was also chair of the Governors Biotechnology Partnership, the Governors Ethanol Coalition, and the Midwest Governors Conference, and has also been chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association's committee on Natural Resources, where he worked to develop the NGA's farm and energy policies.[18]\n\n\nVilsack was thought to be high on the list of potential running mates for Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.[19] In 2005, Vilsack established Heartland PAC, a political action committee aimed at electing Democratic governors. In the first report, he raised over half a million dollars. Vilsack left office in 2007; he did not seek a third term and was succeeded by Chet Culver.\n\n\n\n## 2008 U.S. presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tom Vilsack 2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn November 30, 2006, Tom Vilsack became the second Democrat (after Mike Gravel) to officially announce intentions to run for the presidency in the 2008 election. In his announcement speech, he said \"America's a great country, and now I have the opportunity to begin the process, the legal process of filing papers to run for President of the United States.\" Vilsack dropped out of the race on February 23, 2007, citing monetary constraints.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack's campaign logo\nVilsack's campaign made significant use of social media by maintaining an active MySpace profile, a collection of viral video clips on YouTube, a Facebook profile, videoblog on blip.tv,[21] and a conference call with the podcast site TalkShoe.[22] On January 27, 2007, Vilsack called into the Regular Guys Show hosted by Kurt Hurner to conduct a 15‑minute interview on his running for the Democratic nomination for 2008. Since then, Vilsack appeared again on the show, now The Kurt Hurner Show at Talk Shoe on August 12, 2008, this time as a supporter of Barack Obama for president taking questions from callers to the program for 30 minutes.\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Vilsack joined fellow candidates Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden in supporting the establishment of a U.S. Public Service Academy as a civilian counterpart to the military academies.[23]\n\n\nShortly after ending his 2008 bid for the White House, Vilsack endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton and was named the national co-chair for Clinton's presidential campaign.[24]\n\n\n\n### Views on Iraq[edit]\n\n\nVilsack was critical of President Bush's execution of the war in Iraq, but he hesitated to call for an immediate and complete pullout of U.S. forces: \"I don't think we're losing in Iraq. It appears to be a draw. People are upset by the fact that their kids are over there and there doesn't seem to be any end to this whole process. It's not pacifism that makes people think this way. They're questioning the credibility and competence of the Commander-in-Chief.\"[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack announces his withdrawal from the 2008 presidential race\nOn December 5, Vilsack announced that he favored withdrawing most U.S. forces from Iraq and leaving a small force in the northern region for a limited period. He said U.S. forces provided the Iraqi government with \"both a crutch and an excuse\" for inaction. He said U.S. withdrawal \"may very well require them to go through some chaotic and very difficult times\", but that he believed it the only way to force the Iraqi government to take control of the country.[26]\n\n\n\n### Views on energy security[edit]\n\n\nThe Vilsack Energy Security Agenda set out a strategy to dramatically reduce U.S. reliance on foreign energy and to cut the United States' carbon emissions. It also called for replacing the Department of Energy with a new Department of Energy Security, to oversee and redefine the federal government's role in energy policy. The reorganized department would have acted as an institutional advocate for innovation in energy policy and was intended to ensure accountability as the nation works towards achieving its energy security goals. Through this new department, America's overriding objective in energy policy would have been to make America the unquestioned leader in clean energy, enhancing national security and economic strength.[27]\n\n\nIn a 2007 lecture to the Commonwealth Club of California, Vilsack stated:[28]\n\n\n\n\n> Iowa is one of the nation's leading producers of corn-based ethanol, and many people in my state have an economic stake in the expanded use of corn-based ethanol. But the reality is that corn-based ethanol will never be enough to reach our goals. Some have suggested that we import more sugar-based ethanol from Brazil and we should indeed consider all sources of available ethanol ... but if we are going to create energy security we can't simply replace one imported source of energy with another. That alone is not security ... the only way we can produce enough domestically is if we greatly improve the technology used to produce cellulosic ethanol.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Secretary of Agriculture (2009–2017)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack's 2009 official portrait during his first tenure as Agriculture secretary\n![](image)Vilsack introduces President Barack Obama at the Northeast Iowa Community College, for a White House Rural Economic Forum on August 16, 2011.\nOn December 17, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Vilsack as the nominee to be the 30th Secretary of Agriculture.[29] Vilsack has governed a largely agricultural state as did the previous two Secretaries of Agriculture, Mike Johanns (who was later a United States Senator from Nebraska) (2005–2007) and Ed Schafer (2007–2009).\n\n\nThe Senate confirmed Vilsack's nomination for the position by unanimous consent on January 20, 2009.[30]\n\n\nReaction to Vilsack's nomination from agricultural groups was largely positive and included endorsements from the Corn Refiners Association, the National Grain and Feed Association, the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, and the Environmental Defense Fund.[31] Vilsack was the founder and former chair of the Governor's Biotechnology Partnership, and was named Governor of the Year by the Biotechnology Industry Organization, an industry lobbying group.[32]\n\n\n\n### Actions[edit]\n\n\nVilsack appointed Shirley Sherrod as the Georgia Director of Rural Development, saying she would be an \"important advocate on behalf of rural communities\".[33] Months after the appointment, Vilsack forced her to resign based on accusations of considering race in the handling of her job responsibilities at a private advocacy firm in 1986.[34] Subsequent reports claimed that Vilsack had overreacted to a selectively edited tape of a speech that Sherrod had given to the NAACP. The edited tape had been posted online by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart.[35] Vilsack expressed his \"deep regret\" to Sherrod in acting hastily.[36]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2012, Obama appointed Vilsack the designated survivor during the President's State of the Union address.[37]\n\n\n\n### Beef advocacy[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Vilsack joined three midwest governors in a campaign to defend the use of a processed beef product made from trimmings left after beef carcasses are butchered, dubbed \"pink slime\" by its critics. He said \"it's safe, it contains less fat and historically it's been less expensive\" and that it should be available to consumers and school districts that want to buy it.[38]\n\n\n\n### Global warming[edit]\n\n\nAt a Drake University forum on climate change April 22, 2014, Vilsack stated \"agriculture tends to take the brunt of criticism about climate change, but the industry contributes only 9 percent of the greenhouse gases blamed for a warming planet\" and that while there were \"challenges globally in terms of agriculture and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions that's not necessarily the case in the United States.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Considered resignation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Vilsack told President Obama he was considering resigning from his position. *The Washington Post* reported that he said, \"There are days when I have literally nothing to do\" as he weighed his decision to quit.[40] Obama asked Vilsack to remain in his position and asked him to look into the problem of opioid addiction.[40]\n\n\n\n## Between cabinet tenures[edit]\n\n\nShortly after his tenure ended, Vilsack released a statement in support of his succession by Sonny Perdue as the Secretary of Agriculture, making Perdue the only cabinet member nominee to receive a public statement of support from an Obama cabinet member.[41] He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the United States Senate in 2020, for the seat currently held by Republican incumbent Joni Ernst,[42] but subsequently declined to run.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Vilsack became president and CEO of the US Dairy Export Council.[44]\n\n\nVilsack endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[45]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Agriculture (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vilsack is sworn in for the second time as agriculture secretary by Vice President Kamala Harris, February 24, 2021.\n### Nomination and confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Biden announced he would nominate Vilsack to again serve as the Secretary of Agriculture.[46] The move was met by some with criticism from black farmers and progressives, because of Vilsack's perceived relationship with status quo and corporate agriculture.[47][48][49] He appeared before the Senate Agriculture Committee on February 2, 2021, and was unanimously approved.[50] His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on February 23, 2021, by a 92–7 vote.[51] He was sworn into office by Vice President Kamala Harris on February 24, 2021.[52]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure, Vilsack announced that the USDA would leverage $100 million in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to expand America's meat processing capacity.[53][54]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nVilsack met his wife, Ann Christine \"Christie\" Bell, in a cafeteria while at Hamilton College in New York in October 1968. Vilsack approached her and asked, \"Are you a Humphrey or a Nixon supporter?\" She replied \"Humphrey\" and they soon began dating. On August 18, 1973, the couple was married in Christie Vilsack's hometown of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. Vilsack and his wife moved to Mount Pleasant in 1975, where he joined his father-in-law's law practice.[10]\n\n\nTom and Christie Vilsack have two sons, Jess and Doug.[55]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Vilsack's six-year-old granddaughter, Ella, died of complications from influenza.[56]\n\n\nVilsack won $150,000 in the Powerball in 2020.[57]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n* **1992 election for Iowa State Senate, 49th District:**\n\n\n**Democratic Primary**[58]\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 100.0%\n\n**1992 General Election:[59]**\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 50.1% – 12,544 votes\n* Dave Heaton (R), 42.1% – 10,551 votes\n* Dan Reed (I), 7.8% – 1,945 votes\n\n* **1994 election for Iowa State Senate, 49th District:**\n\n\n**Democratic Primary**[60]\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 99.9% – 1,201 votes\n* *scattering*, 0.1% – 1 vote\n\n**1994 General Election:[61]**\n* Tom Vilsack (D), 98.8% – 12,288 votes\n* *scattering*, 1.2% – 145 votes\n\n* \n\n\n\n\nDemocratic primary results[62]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack**  | **59,130**  | **51.20**  |\n|  | Democratic | Mark McCormick\n | 55,950\n | 48.45\n |\n|  | Democratic | Write-ins\n | 410\n | 0.36\n |\n| Total votes\n | **115,490**  | **100.00**  |\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa gubernatorial election, 1998[63]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack**  | **500,231**  | **52.30%**  | **+10.74%**  |\n|  | Republican | Jim Ross Lightfoot | 444,787\n | 46.51%\n | -10.29%\n |\n|  | Reform | Jim Hennager\n | 5,606\n | 0.59%\n |  |\n|  | Natural Law | Jim Schaefer\n | 3,144\n | 0.33%\n | -0.05%\n |\n|  | Independent | Mark Kennis\n | 2,006\n | 0.21%\n |  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 641\n | 0.07%\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 55,444\n | 5.80%\n | -9.44%\n |\n| Turnout | 956,415\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic primary results[64]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack (incumbent)**  | **79,277**  | **98.55**  |\n|  | Democratic | Write-ins\n | 1,166\n | 1.45\n |\n| Total votes\n | **80,443**  | **100**  |\n\n\n\n\n\nIowa gubernatorial election, 2002[65]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Tom Vilsack (incumbent)**  | **540,449**  | **52.69%**  | **+0.39%**  |\n|  | Republican | Doug Gross\n | 456,612\n | 44.51%\n | -2.00%\n |\n|  | Green | Jay Robinson\n | 14,628\n | 1.43%\n |  |\n|  | Libertarian | Clyde Cleveland\n | 13,098\n | 1.28%\n |  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 1,025\n | 0.10%\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 83,837\n | 8.17%\n | +2.37%\n |\n| Turnout | 1,025,802\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of United States Cabinet members who have served more than eight years\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Pindel, James W.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the 75th governor of Rhode Island from 2015 to 2021, and was the first woman to serve in the role.[1][2]\n\n\nBorn and raised in Rhode Island, Raimondo began her career in venture capital after law school. In 2000, she co-founded Point Judith Capital, Rhode Island's first venture capital firm. Raimondo entered politics in 2010, when she was elected general treasurer of Rhode Island.[3] During her first year in office, she prioritized reforming Rhode Island's public employee pension system.[4]\n\n\nIn 2014, Raimondo was elected governor in a three-way contest with 41% of the vote.[5] While in office, Raimondo was elected to serve as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle.[6] Reelected in 2018, Raimondo was tasked with overseeing the state's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][8] In the 2020 presidential election, she served as co-chair of Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign.[9]\n\n\nDescribed as a \"moderate technocrat\" by *The Washington Post*,[10] Raimondo is often characterized as a centrist within her party.[11][12][13] Chosen to serve as Secretary of Commerce by President Joe Biden,[1] she played a leading role in negotiations for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGina Marie Raimondo was born in 1971[15] in Smithfield, Rhode Island, where she later grew up. Of Italian descent, she is the youngest of Josephine (Piro) and Joseph Raimondo's three children.[16][17] Her father, Joseph (1926–2014), made his career at the Bulova watch factory in Providence, Rhode Island; he became unemployed at 56 when the Bulova company moved its operations to China, shuttering the factory in Providence.[18] Raimondo is a childhood friend of U.S. Senator Jack Reed.[19]\n\n\nRaimondo graduated from LaSalle Academy in Providence. She was one of the first girls allowed to attend the Catholic school, from which she was graduated as valedictorian.[20][21] She went on to Harvard College, graduating *magna cum laude* in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. While at Harvard, Raimondo resided in Quincy House and served on the staff of *The Harvard Crimson*. She played rugby at the Radcliffe Rugby Club, later joking that the experience \"was good training for a career in politics\".[22]\n\n\nRaimondo attended New College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, where she received a Bachelor of Arts (later promoted to Master of Arts by seniority) and Doctor of Philosophy in 2002 in sociology.[23] Her thesis was on single motherhood and supervised by Stephen Nickell and Anne H. Gauthier while she was a postgraduate student of New College, Oxford.[23][24] Raimondo received her Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School in 1998.[24] She has said that her experience working at housing and poverty clinics inspired her to attend law school.[25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Raimondo served as a law clerk to federal judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Later, Raimondo acted as senior vice president for fund development at the Manhattan offices of Village Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and backed by Bain Capital and Highland Capital Groups.[26][27]\n\n\nRaimondo returned to Rhode Island in 2001 to co-found the state's first venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital. Point Judith later relocated to Boston, Massachusetts.[28] At Point Judith, Raimondo served as a general partner covering health care investments; she retains some executive duties with the firm.[29][30] Under her leadership, Point Judith grew to over $100 million in assets and reportedly helped grow over 20 businesses.[31]\n\n\n\n## General Treasurer of Rhode Island (2011–2015)[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 election[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, incumbent general treasurer Frank T. Caprio chose to run for governor rather than seek a second consecutive term in office.[32] Describing the position of general treasurer as “a professional job, not a political job\", Raimondo announced her candidacy for the position, her first campaign for elected office.[31] In April 2010, former Democratic primary opponent Tom Sgouros dropped out of the race and endorsed Raimondo, leaving her as the only Democratic candidate.[33]\n\n\nRunning a campaign that emphasized her business credentials, Raimondo pledged to \"use the power as the chief investment officer to lean on banks to invest again\". Her platform called for financial empowerment programs at senior centers and schools, and for protecting consumers from predatory lending and mortgages.[34] On November 2, Raimondo was elected general treasurer, defeating Republican nominee Kernan F. King by a margin of 62% to 38%.[3]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring her first year as general treasurer, she prioritized reforming Rhode Island's public employee pension system, which was 48% funded in 2010.[4] In April 2011, Raimondo led the state retirement board to reduce the state's assumed rate of return on pension investments from 8.25 percent to 7.5 percent.[35]\n\n\nIn May 2011, Raimondo released \"Truth in Numbers\", a report that advocated benefit cuts as the solution to Rhode Island's pension problems, and she helped lead the effort to cut pensions, along with then-Speaker of the House Gordon Fox.[36] The Rhode Island Retirement Security Act (RIRSA) was enacted by the General Assembly on November 17, 2012, with bipartisan support in both chambers. The next day, then-Governor Lincoln Chafee signed RIRSA into law. RIRSA's legality was challenged in court by the public employee unions, but a settlement was reached in June 2015.[37]\n\n\nUnder Raimondo's tenure, the pension fund was criticized for underperforming when compared with its peers.[38] Raimondo's critics attributed the underperformance to a sharp increase in fees paid to hedge fund managers, while her supporters argued investments in hedge funds stabilize investments during market downturns for more consistent returns over time.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Raimondo in 2012\n#### OSIP program[edit]\n\n\nRaimondo created the Ocean State Investment Pool (OSIP), designed as a low-cost investment vehicle intended to help the state and municipalities better manage and improve the investment performance of their liquid assets, which are used for day-to-day operations including payroll and operating expenses. $500 million in funds could be eligible for the program, which would enable Treasury \"to extend its expertise to municipalities and improve investment returns by creating economies of scale\".[40] The program officially launched on April 23, 2012.[41] As of November 2021, the OSIP program is managed by Fidelity Investments.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Payday lending[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Rhode Island General Assembly's 2012 session, Raimondo advocated for a decrease in the maximum allowable interest rate on payday loans in Rhode Island. She hosted a roundtable discussion with then-Providence mayor Angel Taveras and members of the Rhode Island Payday Reform Coalition.[43]\n\n\nRaimondo submitted letters to the Senate and House Corporations Committees in support of payday reform legislation. She wrote: \"Far too many families are facing financial challenges that might be mitigated or avoided through a greater understanding of personal finance,\" and \"payday loans exploit that lack of understanding ... With numerous economic challenges, Rhode Island should not permit the sale of a financial product that traps so many customers in a cycle of debt.\"[44] Raimondo wrote an op-ed in May 29, 2012, edition of *The Providence Journal* in support of payday lending reform.[45]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Rhode Island (2015–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Raimondo at her inauguration in 2015\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Raimondo ran for governor of Rhode Island, and won a contested Democratic primary against Providence mayor Angel Taveras and former Department of Education official Clay Pell.[46] On November 4, 2014, Raimondo won the general election with 41% of the vote in a three-way race versus Republican Allan Fung and Moderate Party nominee Robert J. Healey.[47]\n\n\nRaimondo was elected to serve as the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle.[6] She was elected chair of the DGA in 2019.[48][49] In 2018, Raimondo was reelected, defeating former secretary of state Matt Brown in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee Fung in the general election.[50][51] Her reelection made her the first candidate to secure a majority of votes for that office since 2006.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nRaimondo was the first female governor of Rhode Island,[52] and one of nine incumbent female governors in the United States at time of her resignation. During her tenure, she was credited with cutting taxes every year and removed eight thousand pages of regulations—30% of the state's regulations. She raised the state minimum wage to $11.50, created a sick-leave entitlement, financed the largest infrastructure program in the state's history, and made community colleges tuition-free.[18] Raimondo appointed more judges of color than any of her predecessors,[53] including Melissa A. Long, the first Black woman to serve on the Rhode Island Supreme Court.[54]\n\n\nAs governor, Raimondo presided over Rhode Island's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 28, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo threatened Raimondo with a lawsuit over a new state quarantine policy that would require people from New York, which had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Rhode Island.[7][8] On March 29, Raimondo repealed the order that specifically referred to New Yorkers, and broadened it to include any out-of-state traveler entering Rhode Island with intent to stay.[55] Partnering with CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, her state achieved one of the nation's highest per capita levels of testing for COVID-19.\n\n\n\n#### Approval ratings[edit]\n\n\nBetween assuming office and the end of 2019, Raimondo consistently ranked toward the bottom of approval ratings for U.S. governors..[56] But her approvals rose significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] State-by-state polling by Microsoft News in April 2020 found that 76% of Rhode Islanders said they approved of the work Raimondo and her administration did \"to keep people safe\" during the ongoing crisis.[57] This result meant that she was tied with the governors of North Dakota and Utah for the 12th-highest rating.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Statewide computer system rollout controversy[edit]\n\n\nA widely criticized rollout of a new computer network system for the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services dubbed the \"Unified Health Infrastructure Project\" (UHIP) in September 2016 saw scores of people without access to government programs such as food stamps and child care due to glitches in the software, designed by Deloitte.[59] This computer crash created a backlog of more than 20,000 cases.[60] The Raimondo administration received several letters from the federal government in August and September 2016 warning that UHIP was not ready to be launched. On Raimondo's orders, the UHIP launch occurred as planned despite these warnings. \n\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth H. Roberts, who resigned as Secretary of Health and Human Services due to the statewide computer system rollout.\nIn response, U.S. Food and Nutrition Service's Northeast Regional Administrator Kurt Messner urged Raimondo to postpone the launch because it would interrupt or interfere with benefits the agency oversees. Messner said in his letter, which local news outlets called \"strongly-worded\", that \"the transition plan remains inadequate and unacceptable.\" He also wrote that the state had not launched UHIP in phases or administered a live pilot test. \"Launching a system without having conducted a live pilot is against the intent of the regulations and against our best advice\", Messner wrote. The Raimondo administration ignored the warnings, resulting in benefit delays, system downtime, and benefit loss caused in error.[61]\n\n\nIn December 2016, the federal government gave the state Department of Human Services less than a month to fix the UHIP computer system or risk losing $13 million in federal funding. Federal officials judged that the state was not compliant in lowering a significant case backlog, starting a sufficient call-center, adequate staff training, and improving wait times at Health and Human Services field offices.[62] In February 2017, Executive Secretary of Health and Human Services Elizabeth H. Roberts resigned from her cabinet post in the Raimondo administration[63] due to the failed roll-out of the UHIP.[63]\n\n\nIn March 2017, *Rhode Island Monthly* reported that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened an investigation into UHIP, specifically false claims and statements made about the Health and Human Services computer network rollout. The investigation was still underway as of summer 2017. In an interview, House Oversight Chair Patricia Serpa said! \"There's plenty of blame to go around. The auditor's report found that [the contract with Deloitte] was poorly written, poorly overseen and poorly executed. They were warned against the implementation because the system was not ready. Not only did they implement it, they displaced all of the most senior workers with the wealth of experience. We pulled all the plugs to make sure this was a failure.\"[64]\n\n\nAccording to documents submitted to the federal government, the cost estimate for UHIP through 2021 was $656 million. State taxpayers would pay $154 million of this and the federal government the remainder.[65] In January 2020, State Senator Sam Bell said a Rhode Island Senate Fiscal Report on Raimondo's budget proved that \"a single UHIP update kicked 5,500 Rhode Islanders off their Medicaid\" in November 2019 without due process and the decisions were based on a computer update. Bell added: \"Medicaid terminations need to be done with some due process. They should not come from a notoriously glitchy computer system. You should have a chance to fight the decision to rip away your health insurance. When you lose your Medicaid with no warning and no effort to transition you onto the exchange, the consequences can be deadly.\"[66]\n\n\n\n#### DCYF controversies[edit]\n\n\nUnder Raimondo, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) had come under fire for the rate of deaths and near-deaths of children in its care.[67] In a period between January 2016 and December 2017, there were 31 fatalities or near fatalities of children in its care, with eight being confirmed fatal.[67] Raimondo appointed Trista Piccola as her new DCYF director in January 2017. Piccola's term was marked by the death and near-deaths of children,[67] high staff turnover,[68] votes of no confidence,[69] and high budget deficits.[70] Rep. Patricia Serpa and Rep. Charlene Lima called for Piccola's resignation, which finally occurred in July 2019.[71][72][73]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families ordered the Raimondo administration DCYF to improve in 33 of 36 areas assessed.[74] The federal report noted that DCYF services were \"inadequate, not developed when needed, or lacked consistent monitoring\". Harvard Kennedy School professor and former Obama administration official Jeffrey Liebman agreed with the recommendations and analysis of the report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and claimed that the DCYF is \"the most messed-up agency ever\".[75]\n\n\nWith Piccola's departure, the interim director is DCYF executive legal counsel Kevin Aucoin.[76] Aucoin has served in an interim director capacity twice before when DCYF was without a permanent director. Secretary of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services and Raimondo cabinet member Womazetta Jones said in December 2019 that she was \"very determined to stay the course of not hiring anybody unless it's the right person\". As of December 2020 DCYF does not have a permanent director.[77]\n\n\nDuring Raimondo's tenure as governor, the DCYF has focused on shifting children from congregate settings to licensed foster homes. DCYF has increased its capacity and utilization of licensed foster homes, including an increase in the number of licensed kinship families, from 280 in October 2019 to 576 in June 2020. As of December 2020, 83% of all children placed in out-of-home care are placed in a foster home. Since 2015, the department's intensive reforms have resulted in a 43% reduction in the number of youth placed in congregate care and a 39% reduction in the number of youth placed in out-of-state congregate care. At the same time, the department has increased the number of children placed in licensed foster family homes.[78]\n\n\n\n## National politics[edit]\n\n\nIn early February 2020, Raimondo appeared alongside former Republican New York City Mayor and Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg at the Wexford Innovation Center in Providence to endorse his candidacy, a move she described as \"an easy call\".[9] Raimondo was named a national co-chair for the Bloomberg campaign.\n\n\nPress secretary Jennifer Bogdan Jones of the Governor's Office told *The Providence Journal* that Raimondo \"is prepared to do whatever it takes to support Mike and defeat President Trump.\"[79] As campaign co-chair, Raimondo would have \"provided advice and attended events\". Less than a month later, Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.[80] On the same day, Raimondo also endorsed Biden. She said Bloomberg \"obviously\" performed poorly on the debate stage but supporting his candidacy \"was an easy decision for me at the beginning. But [supporting Biden] is an easy decision, too.\" Raimondo concluded that it was now time \"to unify behind Joe Biden\".[81]\n\n\nIn May 2020, writer George Will wrote in favor of Raimondo being chosen as Biden's running mate in the 2020 election.[18] U.S. Senator Kamala Harris was chosen instead.\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Commerce (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First official portrait of Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo\nFollowing the 2020 United States presidential election, Raimondo was routinely mentioned as a possible cabinet secretary in the incoming Biden administration. Though first seen as a likely Secretary of Health and Human Services, Raimondo announced on December 3, 2020, that she would not be taking that role.[82] She was also considered for Secretary of the Treasury.[83][84]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Biden announced he would nominate Raimondo to serve as Secretary of Commerce.[85] She appeared before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on January 26.[86] On March 1, the Senate voted 84–15 in favor of cloture on the nomination, and confirmed Raimondo to the position the following day by a vote of 84–15.[87]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Gina Raimondo as Secretary of Commerce Wednesday, March 3, 2021.\nRaimondo was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 3, 2021.[88] In August 2021, *Politico* reported that Raimondo had become one of the \"administration's secret weapons on the Hill\" due to her role in negotiating the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[14]\n\n\nRaimondo was the only Cabinet member not to attend Biden's first State of the Union address on March 1, 2022, since she was chosen as the designated survivor.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Tech policy and cybersecurity[edit]\n\n\nDuring Raimondo's tenure, the Department of Commerce sanctioned NSO Group for selling spyware technology.[90] As Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has worked with other administration officials, such as Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, on coordinating cybersecurity policy.[91] In March 2021, Raimondo issued subpoenas for several China-based telecommunications firms, arguing that \"unrestricted use of untrusted ICTS poses a national security risk\".\n\n\nAs Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has been a co-chair of the Trade and Technology Council since its creation in 2021.[92]\n\n\nAccording to *Axios*, \"Raimondo has become the [tech] industry's key advocate within the Biden administration\" during her tenure.[93] She has been criticized by some progressives for opposing the European Commission's Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposal.[93][94] Raimondo voiced concern in December 2021 that the DMA would unfairly impact U.S.-based tech companies such as Google and Apple. She was criticized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who argued that her comments contradicted the Biden administration's efforts \"to protect consumers and workers from Big Tech monopolies\".[95] In March 2022, Warren accused Raimondo of \"lobbying on behalf of Big Tech\".[96]\n\n\nAs Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has helped lead the U.S. response to the global chip shortage, and has urged Congress to pass legislation that would boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.[97][98] She has argued that the chip shortage presents a national and economic security threat to U.S. interests.[99]\n\n\n\nIn July 2023, it was reported that Raimondo's government email account was hacked in a breach that originated in China.[100][101]\n\n![](image)Raimondo answers questions with Press Secretary Jen Psaki in the White House briefing room, April 2021\n#### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gina Raimondo with Antony Blinken, Stavros Lambrinidis, Margrethe Vestager, and Valdis Dombrovskis, before the inaugural U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)\nIn September 2021, Raimondo accused China of violating the intellectual property (IP) rights of U.S. companies, and said that the Chinese government had put in place \"all kinds of different barriers for American companies to do business in China.\"[102] In October 2021, Senator Tom Cotton criticized her for saying \"there's no point in talking about decoupling our economy from China's\".[103]\n\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Department of Commerce under Raimondo implemented export controls in order to restrict Russia's access to military technology.[104] In March 2022, Raimondo said that Chinese companies attempting to sell semiconductor technology to Russia in violation of U.S. sanctions would face repercussions.[105]\n\n\nRaimondo visited China between 27 and 30 August, where she met minister of culture and tourism Hu Heping, minister of commerce Wang Wentao, vice premier He Lifeng, and premier Li Qiang.[106] She also visited Shanghai, where she met with Shanghai Communist Party secretary Chen Jining, and visited Shanghai Disneyland.[107] During the meeting, the two sides announced a working group on commercial issues and an export control enforcement “information exchange” dialogue.[108]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 General Treasurer election[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2010 Rhode Island General Treasurer Election[109][110]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **69,645**  | **100.00**  |\n| Total votes\n | **69,645**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **201,625**  | **62.14**  |\n|  | Republican | Kernan King\n | 122,860\n | 37.86\n |\n| Total votes\n | **324,485**  | **100**  |\n\n\n### 2014 gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2014 Rhode Island Governor Election[111][112]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **53,990**  | **42.15**  |\n|  | Democratic | Angel Taveras | 37,326\n | 29.14\n |\n|  | Democratic | Clay Pell | 34,515\n | 26.94\n |\n|  | Democratic | Todd Giroux\n | 2,264\n | 1.77\n |\n| Total votes\n | **128,095**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **131,899**  | **40.70**  |\n|  | Republican | Allan Fung | 117,428\n | 36.28\n |\n|  | Moderate | Robert J.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the 75th governor of Rhode Island from 2015 to 2021, and was the first woman to serve in the role.[1][2]\n\n\nBorn and raised in Rhode Island, Raimondo began her career in venture capital after law school. In 2000, she co-founded Point Judith Capital, Rhode Island's first venture capital firm. Raimondo entered politics in 2010, when she was elected general treasurer of Rhode Island.[3] During her first year in office, she prioritized reforming Rhode Island's public employee pension system.[4]\n\n\nIn 2014, Raimondo was elected governor in a three-way contest with 41% of the vote.[5] While in office, Raimondo was elected to serve as vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle.[6] Reelected in 2018, Raimondo was tasked with overseeing the state's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7][8] In the 2020 presidential election, she served as co-chair of Michael Bloomberg's 2020 presidential campaign.[9]\n\n\nDescribed as a \"moderate technocrat\" by *The Washington Post*,[10] Raimondo is often characterized as a centrist within her party.[11][12][13] Chosen to serve as Secretary of Commerce by President Joe Biden,[1] she played a leading role in negotiations for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGina Marie Raimondo was born in 1971[15] in Smithfield, Rhode Island, where she later grew up. Of Italian descent, she is the youngest of Josephine (Piro) and Joseph Raimondo's three children.[16][17] Her father, Joseph (1926–2014), made his career at the Bulova watch factory in Providence, Rhode Island; he became unemployed at 56 when the Bulova company moved its operations to China, shuttering the factory in Providence.[18] Raimondo is a childhood friend of U.S. Senator Jack Reed.[19]\n\n\nRaimondo graduated from LaSalle Academy in Providence. She was one of the first girls allowed to attend the Catholic school, from which she was graduated as valedictorian.[20][21] She went on to Harvard College, graduating *magna cum laude* in 1993 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. While at Harvard, Raimondo resided in Quincy House and served on the staff of *The Harvard Crimson*. She played rugby at the Radcliffe Rugby Club, later joking that the experience \"was good training for a career in politics\".[22]\n\n\nRaimondo attended New College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, where she received a Bachelor of Arts (later promoted to Master of Arts by seniority) and Doctor of Philosophy in 2002 in sociology.[23] Her thesis was on single motherhood and supervised by Stephen Nickell and Anne H. Gauthier while she was a postgraduate student of New College, Oxford.[23][24] Raimondo received her Juris Doctor degree from Yale Law School in 1998.[24] She has said that her experience working at housing and poverty clinics inspired her to attend law school.[25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Raimondo served as a law clerk to federal judge Kimba Wood of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Later, Raimondo acted as senior vice president for fund development at the Manhattan offices of Village Ventures, a venture capital firm based in Williamstown, Massachusetts, and backed by Bain Capital and Highland Capital Groups.[26][27]\n\n\nRaimondo returned to Rhode Island in 2001 to co-found the state's first venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital. Point Judith later relocated to Boston, Massachusetts.[28] At Point Judith, Raimondo served as a general partner covering health care investments; she retains some executive duties with the firm.[29][30] Under her leadership, Point Judith grew to over $100 million in assets and reportedly helped grow over 20 businesses.[31]\n\n\n\n## General Treasurer of Rhode Island (2011–2015)[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 election[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, incumbent general treasurer Frank T. Caprio chose to run for governor rather than seek a second consecutive term in office.[32] Describing the position of general treasurer as “a professional job, not a political job\", Raimondo announced her candidacy for the position, her first campaign for elected office.[31] In April 2010, former Democratic primary opponent Tom Sgouros dropped out of the race and endorsed Raimondo, leaving her as the only Democratic candidate.[33]\n\n\nRunning a campaign that emphasized her business credentials, Raimondo pledged to \"use the power as the chief investment officer to lean on banks to invest again\". Her platform called for financial empowerment programs at senior centers and schools, and for protecting consumers from predatory lending and mortgages.[34] On November 2, Raimondo was elected general treasurer, defeating Republican nominee Kernan F. King by a margin of 62% to 38%.[3]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring her first year as general treasurer, she prioritized reforming Rhode Island's public employee pension system, which was 48% funded in 2010.[4] In April 2011, Raimondo led the state retirement board to reduce the state's assumed rate of return on pension investments from 8.25 percent to 7.5 percent.[35]\n\n\nIn May 2011, Raimondo released \"Truth in Numbers\", a report that advocated benefit cuts as the solution to Rhode Island's pension problems, and she helped lead the effort to cut pensions, along with then-Speaker of the House Gordon Fox.[36] The Rhode Island Retirement Security Act (RIRSA) was enacted by the General Assembly on November 17, 2012, with bipartisan support in both chambers. The next day, then-Governor Lincoln Chafee signed RIRSA into law. RIRSA's legality was challenged in court by the public employee unions, but a settlement was reached in June 2015.[37]\n\n\nUnder Raimondo's tenure, the pension fund was criticized for underperforming when compared with its peers.[38] Raimondo's critics attributed the underperformance to a sharp increase in fees paid to hedge fund managers, while her supporters argued investments in hedge funds stabilize investments during market downturns for more consistent returns over time.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Raimondo in 2012\n#### OSIP program[edit]\n\n\nRaimondo created the Ocean State Investment Pool (OSIP), designed as a low-cost investment vehicle intended to help the state and municipalities better manage and improve the investment performance of their liquid assets, which are used for day-to-day operations including payroll and operating expenses. $500 million in funds could be eligible for the program, which would enable Treasury \"to extend its expertise to municipalities and improve investment returns by creating economies of scale\".[40] The program officially launched on April 23, 2012.[41] As of November 2021, the OSIP program is managed by Fidelity Investments.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Payday lending[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Rhode Island General Assembly's 2012 session, Raimondo advocated for a decrease in the maximum allowable interest rate on payday loans in Rhode Island. She hosted a roundtable discussion with then-Providence mayor Angel Taveras and members of the Rhode Island Payday Reform Coalition.[43]\n\n\nRaimondo submitted letters to the Senate and House Corporations Committees in support of payday reform legislation. She wrote: \"Far too many families are facing financial challenges that might be mitigated or avoided through a greater understanding of personal finance,\" and \"payday loans exploit that lack of understanding ... With numerous economic challenges, Rhode Island should not permit the sale of a financial product that traps so many customers in a cycle of debt.\"[44] Raimondo wrote an op-ed in May 29, 2012, edition of *The Providence Journal* in support of payday lending reform.[45]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Rhode Island (2015–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Raimondo at her inauguration in 2015\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Raimondo ran for governor of Rhode Island, and won a contested Democratic primary against Providence mayor Angel Taveras and former Department of Education official Clay Pell.[46] On November 4, 2014, Raimondo won the general election with 41% of the vote in a three-way race versus Republican Allan Fung and Moderate Party nominee Robert J. Healey.[47]\n\n\nRaimondo was elected to serve as the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA) for the 2018 election cycle.[6] She was elected chair of the DGA in 2019.[48][49] In 2018, Raimondo was reelected, defeating former secretary of state Matt Brown in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee Fung in the general election.[50][51] Her reelection made her the first candidate to secure a majority of votes for that office since 2006.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nRaimondo was the first female governor of Rhode Island,[52] and one of nine incumbent female governors in the United States at time of her resignation. During her tenure, she was credited with cutting taxes every year and removed eight thousand pages of regulations—30% of the state's regulations. She raised the state minimum wage to $11.50, created a sick-leave entitlement, financed the largest infrastructure program in the state's history, and made community colleges tuition-free.[18] Raimondo appointed more judges of color than any of her predecessors,[53] including Melissa A. Long, the first Black woman to serve on the Rhode Island Supreme Court.[54]\n\n\nAs governor, Raimondo presided over Rhode Island's initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 28, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo threatened Raimondo with a lawsuit over a new state quarantine policy that would require people from New York, which had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in Rhode Island.[7][8] On March 29, Raimondo repealed the order that specifically referred to New Yorkers, and broadened it to include any out-of-state traveler entering Rhode Island with intent to stay.[55] Partnering with CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, her state achieved one of the nation's highest per capita levels of testing for COVID-19.\n\n\n\n#### Approval ratings[edit]\n\n\nBetween assuming office and the end of 2019, Raimondo consistently ranked toward the bottom of approval ratings for U.S. governors..[56] But her approvals rose significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] State-by-state polling by Microsoft News in April 2020 found that 76% of Rhode Islanders said they approved of the work Raimondo and her administration did \"to keep people safe\" during the ongoing crisis.[57] This result meant that she was tied with the governors of North Dakota and Utah for the 12th-highest rating.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Statewide computer system rollout controversy[edit]\n\n\nA widely criticized rollout of a new computer network system for the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services dubbed the \"Unified Health Infrastructure Project\" (UHIP) in September 2016 saw scores of people without access to government programs such as food stamps and child care due to glitches in the software, designed by Deloitte.[59] This computer crash created a backlog of more than 20,000 cases.[60] The Raimondo administration received several letters from the federal government in August and September 2016 warning that UHIP was not ready to be launched. On Raimondo's orders, the UHIP launch occurred as planned despite these warnings. \n\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth H. Roberts, who resigned as Secretary of Health and Human Services due to the statewide computer system rollout.\nIn response, U.S. Food and Nutrition Service's Northeast Regional Administrator Kurt Messner urged Raimondo to postpone the launch because it would interrupt or interfere with benefits the agency oversees. Messner said in his letter, which local news outlets called \"strongly-worded\", that \"the transition plan remains inadequate and unacceptable.\" He also wrote that the state had not launched UHIP in phases or administered a live pilot test. \"Launching a system without having conducted a live pilot is against the intent of the regulations and against our best advice\", Messner wrote. The Raimondo administration ignored the warnings, resulting in benefit delays, system downtime, and benefit loss caused in error.[61]\n\n\nIn December 2016, the federal government gave the state Department of Human Services less than a month to fix the UHIP computer system or risk losing $13 million in federal funding. Federal officials judged that the state was not compliant in lowering a significant case backlog, starting a sufficient call-center, adequate staff training, and improving wait times at Health and Human Services field offices.[62] In February 2017, Executive Secretary of Health and Human Services Elizabeth H. Roberts resigned from her cabinet post in the Raimondo administration[63] due to the failed roll-out of the UHIP.[63]\n\n\nIn March 2017, *Rhode Island Monthly* reported that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened an investigation into UHIP, specifically false claims and statements made about the Health and Human Services computer network rollout. The investigation was still underway as of summer 2017. In an interview, House Oversight Chair Patricia Serpa said! \"There's plenty of blame to go around. The auditor's report found that [the contract with Deloitte] was poorly written, poorly overseen and poorly executed. They were warned against the implementation because the system was not ready. Not only did they implement it, they displaced all of the most senior workers with the wealth of experience. We pulled all the plugs to make sure this was a failure.\"[64]\n\n\nAccording to documents submitted to the federal government, the cost estimate for UHIP through 2021 was $656 million. State taxpayers would pay $154 million of this and the federal government the remainder.[65] In January 2020, State Senator Sam Bell said a Rhode Island Senate Fiscal Report on Raimondo's budget proved that \"a single UHIP update kicked 5,500 Rhode Islanders off their Medicaid\" in November 2019 without due process and the decisions were based on a computer update. Bell added: \"Medicaid terminations need to be done with some due process. They should not come from a notoriously glitchy computer system. You should have a chance to fight the decision to rip away your health insurance. When you lose your Medicaid with no warning and no effort to transition you onto the exchange, the consequences can be deadly.\"[66]\n\n\n\n#### DCYF controversies[edit]\n\n\nUnder Raimondo, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) had come under fire for the rate of deaths and near-deaths of children in its care.[67] In a period between January 2016 and December 2017, there were 31 fatalities or near fatalities of children in its care, with eight being confirmed fatal.[67] Raimondo appointed Trista Piccola as her new DCYF director in January 2017. Piccola's term was marked by the death and near-deaths of children,[67] high staff turnover,[68] votes of no confidence,[69] and high budget deficits.[70] Rep. Patricia Serpa and Rep. Charlene Lima called for Piccola's resignation, which finally occurred in July 2019.[71][72][73]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Children and Families ordered the Raimondo administration DCYF to improve in 33 of 36 areas assessed.[74] The federal report noted that DCYF services were \"inadequate, not developed when needed, or lacked consistent monitoring\". Harvard Kennedy School professor and former Obama administration official Jeffrey Liebman agreed with the recommendations and analysis of the report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and claimed that the DCYF is \"the most messed-up agency ever\".[75]\n\n\nWith Piccola's departure, the interim director is DCYF executive legal counsel Kevin Aucoin.[76] Aucoin has served in an interim director capacity twice before when DCYF was without a permanent director. Secretary of the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services and Raimondo cabinet member Womazetta Jones said in December 2019 that she was \"very determined to stay the course of not hiring anybody unless it's the right person\". As of December 2020 DCYF does not have a permanent director.[77]\n\n\nDuring Raimondo's tenure as governor, the DCYF has focused on shifting children from congregate settings to licensed foster homes. DCYF has increased its capacity and utilization of licensed foster homes, including an increase in the number of licensed kinship families, from 280 in October 2019 to 576 in June 2020. As of December 2020, 83% of all children placed in out-of-home care are placed in a foster home. Since 2015, the department's intensive reforms have resulted in a 43% reduction in the number of youth placed in congregate care and a 39% reduction in the number of youth placed in out-of-state congregate care. At the same time, the department has increased the number of children placed in licensed foster family homes.[78]\n\n\n\n## National politics[edit]\n\n\nIn early February 2020, Raimondo appeared alongside former Republican New York City Mayor and Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg at the Wexford Innovation Center in Providence to endorse his candidacy, a move she described as \"an easy call\".[9] Raimondo was named a national co-chair for the Bloomberg campaign.\n\n\nPress secretary Jennifer Bogdan Jones of the Governor's Office told *The Providence Journal* that Raimondo \"is prepared to do whatever it takes to support Mike and defeat President Trump.\"[79] As campaign co-chair, Raimondo would have \"provided advice and attended events\". Less than a month later, Bloomberg dropped out of the race and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden.[80] On the same day, Raimondo also endorsed Biden. She said Bloomberg \"obviously\" performed poorly on the debate stage but supporting his candidacy \"was an easy decision for me at the beginning. But [supporting Biden] is an easy decision, too.\" Raimondo concluded that it was now time \"to unify behind Joe Biden\".[81]\n\n\nIn May 2020, writer George Will wrote in favor of Raimondo being chosen as Biden's running mate in the 2020 election.[18] U.S. Senator Kamala Harris was chosen instead.\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Commerce (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First official portrait of Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo\nFollowing the 2020 United States presidential election, Raimondo was routinely mentioned as a possible cabinet secretary in the incoming Biden administration. Though first seen as a likely Secretary of Health and Human Services, Raimondo announced on December 3, 2020, that she would not be taking that role.[82] She was also considered for Secretary of the Treasury.[83][84]\n\n\nOn January 7, 2021, Biden announced he would nominate Raimondo to serve as Secretary of Commerce.[85] She appeared before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on January 26.[86] On March 1, the Senate voted 84–15 in favor of cloture on the nomination, and confirmed Raimondo to the position the following day by a vote of 84–15.[87]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Gina Raimondo as Secretary of Commerce Wednesday, March 3, 2021.\nRaimondo was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 3, 2021.[88] In August 2021, *Politico* reported that Raimondo had become one of the \"administration's secret weapons on the Hill\" due to her role in negotiating the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[14]\n\n\nRaimondo was the only Cabinet member not to attend Biden's first State of the Union address on March 1, 2022, since she was chosen as the designated survivor.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Tech policy and cybersecurity[edit]\n\n\nDuring Raimondo's tenure, the Department of Commerce sanctioned NSO Group for selling spyware technology.[90] As Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has worked with other administration officials, such as Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, on coordinating cybersecurity policy.[91] In March 2021, Raimondo issued subpoenas for several China-based telecommunications firms, arguing that \"unrestricted use of untrusted ICTS poses a national security risk\".\n\n\nAs Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has been a co-chair of the Trade and Technology Council since its creation in 2021.[92]\n\n\nAccording to *Axios*, \"Raimondo has become the [tech] industry's key advocate within the Biden administration\" during her tenure.[93] She has been criticized by some progressives for opposing the European Commission's Digital Markets Act (DMA) proposal.[93][94] Raimondo voiced concern in December 2021 that the DMA would unfairly impact U.S.-based tech companies such as Google and Apple. She was criticized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who argued that her comments contradicted the Biden administration's efforts \"to protect consumers and workers from Big Tech monopolies\".[95] In March 2022, Warren accused Raimondo of \"lobbying on behalf of Big Tech\".[96]\n\n\nAs Secretary of Commerce, Raimondo has helped lead the U.S. response to the global chip shortage, and has urged Congress to pass legislation that would boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing.[97][98] She has argued that the chip shortage presents a national and economic security threat to U.S. interests.[99]\n\n\n\nIn July 2023, it was reported that Raimondo's government email account was hacked in a breach that originated in China.[100][101]\n\n![](image)Raimondo answers questions with Press Secretary Jen Psaki in the White House briefing room, April 2021\n#### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gina Raimondo with Antony Blinken, Stavros Lambrinidis, Margrethe Vestager, and Valdis Dombrovskis, before the inaugural U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC)\nIn September 2021, Raimondo accused China of violating the intellectual property (IP) rights of U.S. companies, and said that the Chinese government had put in place \"all kinds of different barriers for American companies to do business in China.\"[102] In October 2021, Senator Tom Cotton criticized her for saying \"there's no point in talking about decoupling our economy from China's\".[103]\n\n\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Department of Commerce under Raimondo implemented export controls in order to restrict Russia's access to military technology.[104] In March 2022, Raimondo said that Chinese companies attempting to sell semiconductor technology to Russia in violation of U.S. sanctions would face repercussions.[105]\n\n\nRaimondo visited China between 27 and 30 August, where she met minister of culture and tourism Hu Heping, minister of commerce Wang Wentao, vice premier He Lifeng, and premier Li Qiang.[106] She also visited Shanghai, where she met with Shanghai Communist Party secretary Chen Jining, and visited Shanghai Disneyland.[107] During the meeting, the two sides announced a working group on commercial issues and an export control enforcement “information exchange” dialogue.[108]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 General Treasurer election[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2010 Rhode Island General Treasurer Election[109][110]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **69,645**  | **100.00**  |\n| Total votes\n | **69,645**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **201,625**  | **62.14**  |\n|  | Republican | Kernan King\n | 122,860\n | 37.86\n |\n| Total votes\n | **324,485**  | **100**  |\n\n\n### 2014 gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2014 Rhode Island Governor Election[111][112]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **53,990**  | **42.15**  |\n|  | Democratic | Angel Taveras | 37,326\n | 29.14\n |\n|  | Democratic | Clay Pell | 34,515\n | 26.94\n |\n|  | Democratic | Todd Giroux\n | 2,264\n | 1.77\n |\n| Total votes\n | **128,095**  | **100**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Gina Raimondo**  | **131,899**  | **40.70**  |\n|  | Republican | Allan Fung | 117,428\n | 36.28\n |\n|  | Moderate | Robert J.

The family resides on the east side of Providence.

Su** (born February 19, 1969)[1][2] is an American attorney and government official who has served as acting United States Secretary of Labor since 2023[3] and the 37th United States Deputy Secretary of Labor since 2021. Before assuming that post, Su was the California Labor Secretary, serving under Governor Gavin Newsom from 2019 to 2021,[4] and was the California Labor Commissioner, overseeing California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), under Governor Jerry Brown from 2011 to 2018.[5][6]\n\n\nShe is serving as acting secretary of labor since March 11, 2023 following the departure of incumbent Marty Walsh from the role.[7][8] In February 2023, President Joe Biden officially nominated Su to be his permanent appointee to fill the position.[9] Since her nomination, Su's confirmation has stalled in the Senate; however, the Biden administration plans on keeping Su in an acting capacity which the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has allowed.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSu was born in Wisconsin as a first-generation American. Her mother, unable to afford a ticket on a passenger ship, came to the United States on a cargo ship from China; her father is from Taiwan.[11][12] She graduated from Whitney High School in Cerritos, California. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSu started her legal career at the Asian-Pacific American Legal Center. She was a Litigation Director for Advancing Justice L.A., a non-profit civil rights organization.\n\n\nSu was the lead attorney for the El Monte Thai Garment Slavery Case.[14] As the lead for civil case brought by the El Monte garment workers, Su successfully pursued a legal theory that held manufacturers responsible for the wage theft, as well as the operators who actually kept the garment workers captive. She and other activists also petitioned for the workers to be able to stay in the United States under a visa program for those who cooperate with the government in criminal trials. This led to the creation of the T-Visa for victims of human trafficking.[15]\n\n\nDuring Jerry Brown's tenure as governor, Su headed California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) as the California Labor Commissioner.[6] Under Governor Gavin Newsom, Su served as Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.[4]\n\n\n\n## United States Department of Labor[edit]\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary of Labor[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Su was named as a potential candidate to serve as Secretary of Labor in the Biden administration.[16][17] Su's prospective nomination was pushed by AAPI political leaders and activists, including the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC).[18]\n\n\nConversely, she was opposed by business groups and congressional Republicans. Opponents criticized her leadership of California's unemployment agency during the COVID-19 pandemic,[19] when over a million legitimate applicants had their claims delayed or frozen,[4] while up to $31 billion was sent to fraudulent claimants (including to criminals belonging to national and international crime rings and inmates in the state's prison system).[20][21] Opposition also centered on her enforcement of California's controversial employment law, AB 5.[22][23]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Su was nominated by President Biden to be the Deputy Secretary of Labor under Secretary Marty Walsh. Asian-American leaders, including members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, had lobbied the Biden administration to appoint her as Deputy Secretary after she wasn't chosen to lead the department.[24]\n\n\nThe Senate HELP Committee held hearings on Su's nomination on March 16, 2021. The committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor on April 21, 2021.[25] On July 13, 2021, Su was confirmed to the role by the Senate, in a 50–47 vote.[26]\n\n\n\n### Secretary of Labor nomination[edit]\n\n\nAfter it was reported in 2023 that Walsh would leave the role, Su was expected to serve as acting secretary of labor in his absence.[7][27] After Walsh's resignation announcement, members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus called on Biden to nominate Su as Walsh's permanent successor, citing the lack of Asian-Americans in Biden's cabinet.[28] On February 28, 2023, President Joe Biden nominated Su to serve as the United States secretary of labor.[9]\n\n\nSu's nomination faced challenges on both sides of the aisle, due to the reluctance of Senator Joe Manchin to support her, as well as Republican criticism of her handling of covid unemployment relief funding in California, wherein an estimated $32 billion meant to safeguard unemployed Californians during the pandemic ended up being paid out fraudulently.[29][30] She is currently waiting on confirmation from the full Senate where the confirmation process has stalled due to a lack of votes necessary for confirmation. However, she remains the Acting Secretary of Labor in the interim.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSu's support for California Assembly Bill 5 (2019) and the California FAST Recovery Act, two labor laws that have proven contentious, led to reason business interests criticizing her nomination.[31]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Skadden Fellowship\n* 2001 MacArthur Fellows Program\n* 1996 Reebok International Human Rights Award[32]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* \"Making the Invisible Visible: The Garment Industry's Dirty Laundry\" *University of Iowa Journal on Gender, Race & Justice* (winter 1997–1998)\n* \"Critical Coalitions,\" (with Eric Yamamoto) *Critical Race Theory: An Anthology*\n* \"Workers at the Crossfire: Immigration Enforcement to Preserve Capital,\" in *Unfinished Liberation* (Joy James, ed.

Su** (born February 19, 1969)[1][2] is an American attorney and government official who has served as acting United States Secretary of Labor since 2023[3] and the 37th United States Deputy Secretary of Labor since 2021. Before assuming that post, Su was the California Labor Secretary, serving under Governor Gavin Newsom from 2019 to 2021,[4] and was the California Labor Commissioner, overseeing California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), under Governor Jerry Brown from 2011 to 2018.[5][6]\n\n\nShe is serving as acting secretary of labor since March 11, 2023 following the departure of incumbent Marty Walsh from the role.[7][8] In February 2023, President Joe Biden officially nominated Su to be his permanent appointee to fill the position.[9] Since her nomination, Su's confirmation has stalled in the Senate; however, the Biden administration plans on keeping Su in an acting capacity which the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has allowed.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSu was born in Wisconsin as a first-generation American. Her mother, unable to afford a ticket on a passenger ship, came to the United States on a cargo ship from China; her father is from Taiwan.[11][12] She graduated from Whitney High School in Cerritos, California. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University and a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSu started her legal career at the Asian-Pacific American Legal Center. She was a Litigation Director for Advancing Justice L.A., a non-profit civil rights organization.\n\n\nSu was the lead attorney for the El Monte Thai Garment Slavery Case.[14] As the lead for civil case brought by the El Monte garment workers, Su successfully pursued a legal theory that held manufacturers responsible for the wage theft, as well as the operators who actually kept the garment workers captive. She and other activists also petitioned for the workers to be able to stay in the United States under a visa program for those who cooperate with the government in criminal trials. This led to the creation of the T-Visa for victims of human trafficking.[15]\n\n\nDuring Jerry Brown's tenure as governor, Su headed California's Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) as the California Labor Commissioner.[6] Under Governor Gavin Newsom, Su served as Secretary of the California Labor and Workforce Development Agency.[4]\n\n\n\n## United States Department of Labor[edit]\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary of Labor[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Su was named as a potential candidate to serve as Secretary of Labor in the Biden administration.[16][17] Su's prospective nomination was pushed by AAPI political leaders and activists, including the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC).[18]\n\n\nConversely, she was opposed by business groups and congressional Republicans. Opponents criticized her leadership of California's unemployment agency during the COVID-19 pandemic,[19] when over a million legitimate applicants had their claims delayed or frozen,[4] while up to $31 billion was sent to fraudulent claimants (including to criminals belonging to national and international crime rings and inmates in the state's prison system).[20][21] Opposition also centered on her enforcement of California's controversial employment law, AB 5.[22][23]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2021, Su was nominated by President Biden to be the Deputy Secretary of Labor under Secretary Marty Walsh. Asian-American leaders, including members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, had lobbied the Biden administration to appoint her as Deputy Secretary after she wasn't chosen to lead the department.[24]\n\n\nThe Senate HELP Committee held hearings on Su's nomination on March 16, 2021. The committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor on April 21, 2021.[25] On July 13, 2021, Su was confirmed to the role by the Senate, in a 50–47 vote.[26]\n\n\n\n### Secretary of Labor nomination[edit]\n\n\nAfter it was reported in 2023 that Walsh would leave the role, Su was expected to serve as acting secretary of labor in his absence.[7][27] After Walsh's resignation announcement, members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus called on Biden to nominate Su as Walsh's permanent successor, citing the lack of Asian-Americans in Biden's cabinet.[28] On February 28, 2023, President Joe Biden nominated Su to serve as the United States secretary of labor.[9]\n\n\nSu's nomination faced challenges on both sides of the aisle, due to the reluctance of Senator Joe Manchin to support her, as well as Republican criticism of her handling of covid unemployment relief funding in California, wherein an estimated $32 billion meant to safeguard unemployed Californians during the pandemic ended up being paid out fraudulently.[29][30] She is currently waiting on confirmation from the full Senate where the confirmation process has stalled due to a lack of votes necessary for confirmation. However, she remains the Acting Secretary of Labor in the interim.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSu's support for California Assembly Bill 5 (2019) and the California FAST Recovery Act, two labor laws that have proven contentious, led to reason business interests criticizing her nomination.[31]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Skadden Fellowship\n* 2001 MacArthur Fellows Program\n* 1996 Reebok International Human Rights Award[32]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* \"Making the Invisible Visible: The Garment Industry's Dirty Laundry\" *University of Iowa Journal on Gender, Race & Justice* (winter 1997–1998)\n* \"Critical Coalitions,\" (with Eric Yamamoto) *Critical Race Theory: An Anthology*\n* \"Workers at the Crossfire: Immigration Enforcement to Preserve Capital,\" in *Unfinished Liberation* (Joy James, ed.

He was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Downtown Los Angeles in Congress from 1993 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Becerra was Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 2013 to 2017.[1]\n\n\nBorn in Sacramento, California, Becerra graduated from Stanford University and received his Juris Doctor degree from Stanford Law School. He worked as a lawyer at the Legal Assistance Corporation of central Massachusetts, before returning to California in 1986 to work as an administrative assistant for state senator Art Torres. He served as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice from 1987 to 1990 before he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he served one term from 1990 to 1992.\n\n\nBecerra was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1992. He represented California's 30th congressional district from 1993 to 2003, California's 31st congressional district from 2003 to 2013, and California's 34th congressional district from 2013 to 2017. He served as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from 1997 to 1999, Vice Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 2009 to 2013, and as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Sacramento, California, on January 26, 1958,[2][3] Becerra is the son of working-class parents, Maria Teresa and Manuel Guerrero Becerra. His father was born in the U.S. and raised in Tijuana, Mexico, and his mother was from Guadalajara.[4][5][6] As a child, Becerra grew up in a one-room apartment with his three sisters.[7] He graduated in 1976 from C.K. McClatchy High School, located in the center of Sacramento.[8] He studied abroad at the University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain, from 1978 to 1979, before earning his Bachelor of Arts in economics from Stanford University in 1980, becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college.[9][10] He received his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1984, and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1985.[11]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nBecerra began his career as a lawyer, working on cases involving individuals who had mental disorders for the Legal Assistance Corporation of Central Massachusetts[12] (now Community Legal Aid).\n\n\nBecerra worked as an administrative assistant for California state senator Art Torres in 1986.[13] He served as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice under Attorney General John Van de Kamp from 1987 to 1990.[14]\n\n\nAfter incumbent state assemblyman Charles Calderon decided to seek a seat in the California Senate, Becerra launched a grass-roots campaign for the California State Assembly, defeating Calderon's Senate aide Marta Maestas in the Democratic primary.[15][*better source needed*] He went on to defeat Republican Lee Lieberg and Libertarian Steven Pencall, receiving 60% of the vote.[16] Becerra served one term in the State Assembly, representing California's 59th district, from 1990 to 1992.[6] As a state legislator, Becerra worked to pass a law that would increase gang members' sentences.[17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2017)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, 25th district congressman Edward Roybal announced his retirement after 30 years in Congress. Becerra entered the race for the seat, which had been renumbered as the 30th district after redistricting.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBecerra won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote.[18] In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Morry Waksberg, 58%–24%.[19] He won re-election to a second term in 1994 with 66%[20] of the vote. His district was renumbered as the 31st district after the 2000 census.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter redistricting, ahead of the 2012 elections, most of Becerra's old district became the 34th district. He defeated Republican Stephen Smith 85.6% to 14.4%.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elijah Cummings, Xavier Becerra, and Robert Matsui at a press conference on civil rights in 1997\n![](image)Tipper Gore, Becerra, and President Bill Clinton\nBecerra was a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which he served as chairman during the 105th Congress.[22]\n\n\nBecerra voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 because he \"wanted to see direct protections for responsible homeowners\" in the bill.[23]\n\n\nBecerra was appointed assistant to the Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress.[24] He won his bid to succeed John Larson as Vice-Chair in the 111th Congress, defeating Marcy Kaptur of Ohio by a vote of 175–67.[25]\n\n\nBecerra successfully ran for a second term as Vice-Chair in 2011 to serve during the 112th Congress.[26]\n\n\nDuring the 111th Congress and 112th Congress, Becerra served on several high-profile committees. He was appointed to serve on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (often called Bowles-Simpson/Simpson-Bowles) on March 24, 2010.[27] Becerra was selected to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (also known as the Super Committee) on August 11, 2011.[28] And on December 23, 2011, he was appointed to serve on a bi-cameral conference committee to find bi-partisan solutions on middle-class tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and the Medicare physician payment rate.[29]\n\n\nBecerra had a seat on the House Ways and Means Committee and was the first Latino to serve on the committee.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion rights and pay equity[edit]\n\n\nA writer for *Vanity Fair* described Becerra as a \"strident supporter of women's health and reproductive rights\";[30] *The New York Times* stated that he has been \"vocal in the Democratic Party about fighting for women's health\".[31] He voted against H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act (PRENDA), which would have imposed civil and criminal penalties on anyone knowingly attempting to perform a sex-selective abortion. The 2012 bill also would have required health care providers to report known or suspected violations to law enforcement, including suspicions about a woman's motives for seeking an abortion.[32] Becerra received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2012.[33][34] Becerra voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.[35][36]\n\n\nBecerra argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order, should be required to provide birth control services under the Affordable Care Act.[37] In late 2020, arguing that the prosecution would discourage pregnant women from obtaining addiction treatment, Becerra requested that the Supreme Court of California block the murder prosecution of a woman who had consumed methamphetamine during her pregnancy, resulting in a stillbirth. The court declined to do so.[38] In response to the Trump administration's 2020 decision to restrict federal funding to California because it requires insurance providers to cover abortion, Becerra stated that \"California has the sovereign right to protect women's reproductive rights\".[39]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* **Committee on Ways and Means**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health\n\t+ Subcommittee on Social Security\n* **Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction**\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Hispanic Caucus (Former Chair)\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus\n\n\n## Other political ambitions[edit]\n\n\n### 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election\n\nBecerra ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2001. He finished with 6% of the primary vote,[40] finishing behind businessman Steve Soboroff, Councilman Joel Wachs, former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, and the eventual winner, then-City Attorney James Hahn.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Consideration for federal government positions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Becerra was considered for the position of U.S. Trade Representative in the administration of President-elect Obama.[41] While it was reported that he had already accepted,[42] he announced on December 15 that he would not accept the position.[43] Becerra had endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama for president on January 27, 2008.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBecerra was on the shortlist of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the vice presidential nomination in 2016.[44] Senator Tim Kaine was eventually chosen.\n\n\nDuring the presidential transition of Joe Biden in 2020, it was reported that Becerra was being considered for the Cabinet positions of Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General.[45]\n\n\n\n### 2020 U.S. Senate speculation[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, California Senator Kamala Harris was selected by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. After Biden ultimately won the general election, Becerra was floated as a possible replacement for Harris, along with others such as Representative Karen Bass, Representative Barbara Lee, Secretary of State Alex Padilla (who was eventually chosen), and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solís.[46][47][48] Early December reports that Biden planned to nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services rendered such speculation moot.\n\n\n\n## California Attorney General (2017–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Becerra speaking to the California Democratic Party State Convention in 2019\nBecerra accepted Governor Jerry Brown's offer to be the attorney general of California on December 1, 2016. The California Legislature confirmed Becerra to the post on January 23, 2017. He succeeded Kamala Harris, who was elected to the United States Senate.[49] Becerra was sworn in January 24, 2017, becoming the first Latino to serve as California's attorney general.[50] Becerra was elected to a full four-year term in 2018, after defeating Republican challenger Steven Bailey and securing 61 percent of the vote.[51]\n\n\nWhile Attorney General, Becerra delivered the Democratic Spanish-language response to President Trump's 2019 State of the Union address.[52]\n\n\n\n### California Department of Justice reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Becerra created an environmental justice branch of the California Department of Justice. Among other projects, it opposed the effort to expand San Bernardino International Airport due to concerns regarding air pollution.[53]\n\n\n\n### California law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nBecerra brought fourteen felony charges against Center for Medical Progress activists for recording fourteen videos (see Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy), and one felony charge for conspiring to invade privacy, on March 28, 2017.[54] The charges were dismissed by a California Superior Court judge in June for not stating the names of those recorded and the specific dates of the recordings;[55] the charges were refiled with the names and dates in July 2017.[56]\n\n\nIn 2019, Becerra threatened \"legal action\" against reporters who had received records of California law enforcement officers who had been convicted of crimes during the past decade.[57]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Becerra was faulted by state district attorneys for not taking leadership to help stop unemployment fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic, in what was described as the \"biggest taxpayer fraud in California history\".[58] In January 2021, investigators said the total fraud was over $11 billion, with $19 billion in claims still under investigation.[59][60][61] Most of this money will likely never be recovered, prosecutors said.[58][62][63]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits against Trump administration[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Becerra, Governor Gavin Newsom, and 15 other states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the president's declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall at the southern U.S. border.[64] As of September 26, 2019, Becerra had sued the Trump administration 62 times in total.[65]\n\n\nThe Trump administration opened 1 million acres in California to fracking and drilling in December 2019.[66] Under the new policy, the Bureau of Land Management proposed new lease sales for oil and gas extraction along \"California's Central Valley and Central Coast, touching eight counties and including 400,000 acres of public land\".[67] California officials and agencies, including Becerra, filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management in January 2020.[68][67]\n\n\nDespite the multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration filed with other state attorneys general, Becerra had not joined antitrust efforts against any major tech companies. His office would not disclose whether it had examined any tech companies and had not endorsed any joint investigations with other states.[69] On December 9, 2020, it was reported that Becerra's office had joined 47 other states and the Federal Trade Commission in an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, Inc, headquartered in California.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Ballot drafting[edit]\n\n\nAs Attorney General of California, Becerra was tasked with writing ballot titles and summaries that appeared on voter information guides and ballots in both the 2018 and 2020 elections. Proponents accused Becerra multiple times of writing biased descriptions that violated the law, which requires \"a true and impartial statement of the purpose\" of measures. In one of many unsuccessful lawsuits against Becerra, a state judge wrote that attorneys general have \"wide latitude\" in how they write ballot descriptions. Critics said the responsibility to write the ballot title and summary should be transferred to a different, non-partisan office.[72][73]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Health and Human Services (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nAfter Joe Biden's election as president in November 2020, Becerra was considered a candidate for United States Attorney General.[74][45] The *New York Times* reported in early December 2020 that Biden would nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services.[75] His nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department has been criticized by pro-life and conservative leaders led by Students for Life of America, citing his \"absence of health care experience and his disregard for people of faith\".[76][77] Becerra's nomination was deadlocked by the Senate's Finance Committee on March 10, 2021.[78] One day later, on March 11, 2021, Becerra's nomination was discharged from the Finance Committee by the entire Senate, in a vote of 51-48.[79] He was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 50-49 on March 18, 2021, with all but one Democrat present and one Republican, Susan Collins, voting in favor.[80][81] This was the narrowest vote for any of Biden's cabinet positions. On March 22, 2021, Becerra was sworn in to be the new secretary.[82]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secretary Becerra with First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, June 4, 2021\nSoon after officially becoming the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Becerra released a statement praising the Affordable Care Act and encouraging people to keep enrolling in its health care program.[83] Becerra also became Secretary during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, of which his cabinet department the U.S. Health and Human Services was mainly responsible for mitigating the pandemic's effects to the American public. \n\n\nBecerra has been widely criticized as health and human services secretary for being absent in the public eye during the pandemic, for being responsible for confusing messaging by federal public health authorities and for the subsequent loss of public trust, and for his passive management style while serving as secretary, with some administration officials, public health experts, and scientists calling for him to improve his performance or step aside; his defenders said he was given an unclear role as secretary.[84] Becerra was similarly criticized following his agency's response to the 2022 monkeypox outbreak amid issues with health policy communication and what was widely considered a slow response; White House officials said that Becerra sought to scapegoat the states to avoid criticism rather than take responsibility for the subpar response.[85]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2022, Becerra was tasked by President Biden with expeditiously reviewing the Schedule I classification of Cannabis.[86]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* published investigations regarding immigrant child laborers who are working in violation of child labor laws across the U.S. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for the welfare of these children, but according to the Times' reports, \"Again and again, veteran government staffers and outside contractors told the Health and Human Services Department, including in reports that reached Secretary Xavier Becerra, that children appeared to be at risk\".[87]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBecerra is married to physician Carolina Reyes, and they have three daughters.[88] He is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank, based in Washington, D.C.[89] Becerra is Roman Catholic.[90]\n\n\n\n## Election history[edit]\n\n\n### California State Assembly[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1990 California State Assembly 59th district election[91][92][93]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra**  | **9,098**  | **34.80**  |\n|  | Democratic | Marta Maestas\n | 7,352\n | 28.12\n |\n|  | Democratic | Diane Martinez\n | 6,703\n | 25.64\n |\n|  | Democratic | Larry Salazar\n | 1,509\n | 5.77\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bill Hernandez\n | 1,482\n | 5.67\n |\n| Total votes\n | **26,144**  | **100%**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra**  | **34,650**  | **60.87**  |\n|  | Republican | Lee Lieberg\n | 19,938\n | 35.03\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Steven Pencall\n | 2,331\n | 4.10\n |\n| Total votes\n | **56,919**  | **100%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n### U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1992 United States House of Representatives in California, District 30[94][95]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra**  | **10,417**  | **31.84**  |\n|  | Democratic | Leticia Quezada | 7,089\n | 21.67\n |\n|  | Democratic | Albert C.

Becerra previously served as the Attorney General of California from January 2017 until March 2021. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Downtown Los Angeles in Congress from 1993 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, Becerra was Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 2013 to 2017.[1]\n\n\nBorn in Sacramento, California, Becerra graduated from Stanford University and received his Juris Doctor degree from Stanford Law School. He worked as a lawyer at the Legal Assistance Corporation of central Massachusetts, before returning to California in 1986 to work as an administrative assistant for state senator Art Torres. He served as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice from 1987 to 1990 before he was elected to the California State Assembly, where he served one term from 1990 to 1992.\n\n\nBecerra was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1992. He represented California's 30th congressional district from 1993 to 2003, California's 31st congressional district from 2003 to 2013, and California's 34th congressional district from 2013 to 2017. He served as Chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus from 1997 to 1999, Vice Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus from 2009 to 2013, and as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Sacramento, California, on January 26, 1958,[2][3] Becerra is the son of working-class parents, Maria Teresa and Manuel Guerrero Becerra. His father was born in the U.S. and raised in Tijuana, Mexico, and his mother was from Guadalajara.[4][5][6] As a child, Becerra grew up in a one-room apartment with his three sisters.[7] He graduated in 1976 from C.K. McClatchy High School, located in the center of Sacramento.[8] He studied abroad at the University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain, from 1978 to 1979, before earning his Bachelor of Arts in economics from Stanford University in 1980, becoming the first person in his family to graduate from college.[9][10] He received his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1984, and was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1985.[11]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nBecerra began his career as a lawyer, working on cases involving individuals who had mental disorders for the Legal Assistance Corporation of Central Massachusetts[12] (now Community Legal Aid).\n\n\nBecerra worked as an administrative assistant for California state senator Art Torres in 1986.[13] He served as a deputy attorney general in the California Department of Justice under Attorney General John Van de Kamp from 1987 to 1990.[14]\n\n\nAfter incumbent state assemblyman Charles Calderon decided to seek a seat in the California Senate, Becerra launched a grass-roots campaign for the California State Assembly, defeating Calderon's Senate aide Marta Maestas in the Democratic primary.[15][*better source needed*] He went on to defeat Republican Lee Lieberg and Libertarian Steven Pencall, receiving 60% of the vote.[16] Becerra served one term in the State Assembly, representing California's 59th district, from 1990 to 1992.[6] As a state legislator, Becerra worked to pass a law that would increase gang members' sentences.[17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2017)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, 25th district congressman Edward Roybal announced his retirement after 30 years in Congress. Becerra entered the race for the seat, which had been renumbered as the 30th district after redistricting.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBecerra won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote.[18] In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Morry Waksberg, 58%–24%.[19] He won re-election to a second term in 1994 with 66%[20] of the vote. His district was renumbered as the 31st district after the 2000 census.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter redistricting, ahead of the 2012 elections, most of Becerra's old district became the 34th district. He defeated Republican Stephen Smith 85.6% to 14.4%.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elijah Cummings, Xavier Becerra, and Robert Matsui at a press conference on civil rights in 1997\n![](image)Tipper Gore, Becerra, and President Bill Clinton\nBecerra was a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which he served as chairman during the 105th Congress.[22]\n\n\nBecerra voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 because he \"wanted to see direct protections for responsible homeowners\" in the bill.[23]\n\n\nBecerra was appointed assistant to the Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress.[24] He won his bid to succeed John Larson as Vice-Chair in the 111th Congress, defeating Marcy Kaptur of Ohio by a vote of 175–67.[25]\n\n\nBecerra successfully ran for a second term as Vice-Chair in 2011 to serve during the 112th Congress.[26]\n\n\nDuring the 111th Congress and 112th Congress, Becerra served on several high-profile committees. He was appointed to serve on the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (often called Bowles-Simpson/Simpson-Bowles) on March 24, 2010.[27] Becerra was selected to serve on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (also known as the Super Committee) on August 11, 2011.[28] And on December 23, 2011, he was appointed to serve on a bi-cameral conference committee to find bi-partisan solutions on middle-class tax cuts, unemployment insurance, and the Medicare physician payment rate.[29]\n\n\nBecerra had a seat on the House Ways and Means Committee and was the first Latino to serve on the committee.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion rights and pay equity[edit]\n\n\nA writer for *Vanity Fair* described Becerra as a \"strident supporter of women's health and reproductive rights\";[30] *The New York Times* stated that he has been \"vocal in the Democratic Party about fighting for women's health\".[31] He voted against H.R. 3541, the Prenatal Non-Discrimination Act (PRENDA), which would have imposed civil and criminal penalties on anyone knowingly attempting to perform a sex-selective abortion. The 2012 bill also would have required health care providers to report known or suspected violations to law enforcement, including suspicions about a woman's motives for seeking an abortion.[32] Becerra received a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2012.[33][34] Becerra voted for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009.[35][36]\n\n\nBecerra argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious order, should be required to provide birth control services under the Affordable Care Act.[37] In late 2020, arguing that the prosecution would discourage pregnant women from obtaining addiction treatment, Becerra requested that the Supreme Court of California block the murder prosecution of a woman who had consumed methamphetamine during her pregnancy, resulting in a stillbirth. The court declined to do so.[38] In response to the Trump administration's 2020 decision to restrict federal funding to California because it requires insurance providers to cover abortion, Becerra stated that \"California has the sovereign right to protect women's reproductive rights\".[39]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* **Committee on Ways and Means**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health\n\t+ Subcommittee on Social Security\n* **Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction**\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Hispanic Caucus (Former Chair)\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus\n\n\n## Other political ambitions[edit]\n\n\n### 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2001 Los Angeles mayoral election\n\nBecerra ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2001. He finished with 6% of the primary vote,[40] finishing behind businessman Steve Soboroff, Councilman Joel Wachs, former California State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, and the eventual winner, then-City Attorney James Hahn.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Consideration for federal government positions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Becerra was considered for the position of U.S. Trade Representative in the administration of President-elect Obama.[41] While it was reported that he had already accepted,[42] he announced on December 15 that he would not accept the position.[43] Becerra had endorsed then-Senator Barack Obama for president on January 27, 2008.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBecerra was on the shortlist of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for the vice presidential nomination in 2016.[44] Senator Tim Kaine was eventually chosen.\n\n\nDuring the presidential transition of Joe Biden in 2020, it was reported that Becerra was being considered for the Cabinet positions of Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General.[45]\n\n\n\n### 2020 U.S. Senate speculation[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, California Senator Kamala Harris was selected by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. After Biden ultimately won the general election, Becerra was floated as a possible replacement for Harris, along with others such as Representative Karen Bass, Representative Barbara Lee, Secretary of State Alex Padilla (who was eventually chosen), and former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solís.[46][47][48] Early December reports that Biden planned to nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services rendered such speculation moot.\n\n\n\n## California Attorney General (2017–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Becerra speaking to the California Democratic Party State Convention in 2019\nBecerra accepted Governor Jerry Brown's offer to be the attorney general of California on December 1, 2016. The California Legislature confirmed Becerra to the post on January 23, 2017. He succeeded Kamala Harris, who was elected to the United States Senate.[49] Becerra was sworn in January 24, 2017, becoming the first Latino to serve as California's attorney general.[50] Becerra was elected to a full four-year term in 2018, after defeating Republican challenger Steven Bailey and securing 61 percent of the vote.[51]\n\n\nWhile Attorney General, Becerra delivered the Democratic Spanish-language response to President Trump's 2019 State of the Union address.[52]\n\n\n\n### California Department of Justice reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Becerra created an environmental justice branch of the California Department of Justice. Among other projects, it opposed the effort to expand San Bernardino International Airport due to concerns regarding air pollution.[53]\n\n\n\n### California law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nBecerra brought fourteen felony charges against Center for Medical Progress activists for recording fourteen videos (see Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy), and one felony charge for conspiring to invade privacy, on March 28, 2017.[54] The charges were dismissed by a California Superior Court judge in June for not stating the names of those recorded and the specific dates of the recordings;[55] the charges were refiled with the names and dates in July 2017.[56]\n\n\nIn 2019, Becerra threatened \"legal action\" against reporters who had received records of California law enforcement officers who had been convicted of crimes during the past decade.[57]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Becerra was faulted by state district attorneys for not taking leadership to help stop unemployment fraud during the COVID-19 pandemic, in what was described as the \"biggest taxpayer fraud in California history\".[58] In January 2021, investigators said the total fraud was over $11 billion, with $19 billion in claims still under investigation.[59][60][61] Most of this money will likely never be recovered, prosecutors said.[58][62][63]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuits against Trump administration[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Becerra, Governor Gavin Newsom, and 15 other states filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the president's declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall at the southern U.S. border.[64] As of September 26, 2019, Becerra had sued the Trump administration 62 times in total.[65]\n\n\nThe Trump administration opened 1 million acres in California to fracking and drilling in December 2019.[66] Under the new policy, the Bureau of Land Management proposed new lease sales for oil and gas extraction along \"California's Central Valley and Central Coast, touching eight counties and including 400,000 acres of public land\".[67] California officials and agencies, including Becerra, filed a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management in January 2020.[68][67]\n\n\nDespite the multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration filed with other state attorneys general, Becerra had not joined antitrust efforts against any major tech companies. His office would not disclose whether it had examined any tech companies and had not endorsed any joint investigations with other states.[69] On December 9, 2020, it was reported that Becerra's office had joined 47 other states and the Federal Trade Commission in an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, Inc, headquartered in California.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Ballot drafting[edit]\n\n\nAs Attorney General of California, Becerra was tasked with writing ballot titles and summaries that appeared on voter information guides and ballots in both the 2018 and 2020 elections. Proponents accused Becerra multiple times of writing biased descriptions that violated the law, which requires \"a true and impartial statement of the purpose\" of measures. In one of many unsuccessful lawsuits against Becerra, a state judge wrote that attorneys general have \"wide latitude\" in how they write ballot descriptions. Critics said the responsibility to write the ballot title and summary should be transferred to a different, non-partisan office.[72][73]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Health and Human Services (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nAfter Joe Biden's election as president in November 2020, Becerra was considered a candidate for United States Attorney General.[74][45] The *New York Times* reported in early December 2020 that Biden would nominate Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services.[75] His nomination to lead the Health and Human Services Department has been criticized by pro-life and conservative leaders led by Students for Life of America, citing his \"absence of health care experience and his disregard for people of faith\".[76][77] Becerra's nomination was deadlocked by the Senate's Finance Committee on March 10, 2021.[78] One day later, on March 11, 2021, Becerra's nomination was discharged from the Finance Committee by the entire Senate, in a vote of 51-48.[79] He was confirmed by the Senate in a vote of 50-49 on March 18, 2021, with all but one Democrat present and one Republican, Susan Collins, voting in favor.[80][81] This was the narrowest vote for any of Biden's cabinet positions. On March 22, 2021, Becerra was sworn in to be the new secretary.[82]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secretary Becerra with First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough, June 4, 2021\nSoon after officially becoming the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Becerra released a statement praising the Affordable Care Act and encouraging people to keep enrolling in its health care program.[83] Becerra also became Secretary during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, of which his cabinet department the U.S. Health and Human Services was mainly responsible for mitigating the pandemic's effects to the American public. \n\n\nBecerra has been widely criticized as health and human services secretary for being absent in the public eye during the pandemic, for being responsible for confusing messaging by federal public health authorities and for the subsequent loss of public trust, and for his passive management style while serving as secretary, with some administration officials, public health experts, and scientists calling for him to improve his performance or step aside; his defenders said he was given an unclear role as secretary.[84] Becerra was similarly criticized following his agency's response to the 2022 monkeypox outbreak amid issues with health policy communication and what was widely considered a slow response; White House officials said that Becerra sought to scapegoat the states to avoid criticism rather than take responsibility for the subpar response.[85]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2022, Becerra was tasked by President Biden with expeditiously reviewing the Schedule I classification of Cannabis.[86]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* published investigations regarding immigrant child laborers who are working in violation of child labor laws across the U.S. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for the welfare of these children, but according to the Times' reports, \"Again and again, veteran government staffers and outside contractors told the Health and Human Services Department, including in reports that reached Secretary Xavier Becerra, that children appeared to be at risk\".[87]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBecerra is married to physician Carolina Reyes, and they have three daughters.[88] He is a member of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank, based in Washington, D.C.[89] Becerra is Roman Catholic.[90]\n\n\n\n## Election history[edit]\n\n\n### California State Assembly[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1990 California State Assembly 59th district election[91][92][93]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra**  | **9,098**  | **34.80**  |\n|  | Democratic | Marta Maestas\n | 7,352\n | 28.12\n |\n|  | Democratic | Diane Martinez\n | 6,703\n | 25.64\n |\n|  | Democratic | Larry Salazar\n | 1,509\n | 5.77\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bill Hernandez\n | 1,482\n | 5.67\n |\n| Total votes\n | **26,144**  | **100%**  |\n| General election\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra**  | **34,650**  | **60.87**  |\n|  | Republican | Lee Lieberg\n | 19,938\n | 35.03\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Steven Pencall\n | 2,331\n | 4.10\n |\n| Total votes\n | **56,919**  | **100%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n### U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1992 United States House of Representatives in California, District 30[94][95]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Xavier Becerra**  | **10,417**  | **31.84**  |\n|  | Democratic | Leticia Quezada | 7,089\n | 21.67\n |\n|  | Democratic | Albert C.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 11th congressional district from 2008 to 2021. The district includes most of the black-majority precincts between Cleveland and Akron.\n\n\nFollowing the death of Stephanie Tubbs Jones in 2008, Fudge ran unopposed in the special election to replace her.[1] She was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress.[2] She considered running for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives at the start of the 116th Congress but eventually announced she would back Nancy Pelosi.[3]\n\n\nThen president-elect Joe Biden nominated Fudge as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on December 10, 2020. The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs advanced her nomination by a vote of 17–7 on February 4, 2021.[4] She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021, by a vote of 66–34.[5] She was virtually sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 10, 2021.[6] Upon taking her oath of office, she became the second African-American woman to serve as secretary of housing and urban development.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFudge was born in Cleveland Ohio, on October 29, 1952.[8] A 1971 graduate of Shaker Heights High School,[9] she earned her Bachelor of Science in business from the Ohio State University in 1975.[10] In 1983, she earned a Juris Doctor from the Cleveland State University College of Law.[11]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nAfter college, she worked as a law clerk and studied legal research. She also worked in the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office as Director of Budget and Finance.[12] Fudge has also worked as an auditor for the county's estate tax department and has occasionally served as a visiting judge and as a chief referee for arbitration.[13]\n\n\nFudge was the mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, from 2000 to November 18, 2008.[14][15] Her 1999 campaign was her first run for any elected office. She was the town's first female and first African American mayor.[16]\n\n\nFudge served as chief of staff to U.S. Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones during Jones's first term in Congress.[17] She has also served on the board of trustees for the Cleveland Public Library.[16]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAfter Stephanie Tubbs Jones's death on August 20, 2008, a committee of local Democratic leaders selected Fudge as her replacement on the November ballot. This virtually assured her election in the heavily Democratic, black-majority district.[18][19] Fudge won the November 4 general election, defeating Republican Thomas Pekarek with 85% of the vote.[20] She was unopposed in a November 18 special election for the balance of Jones's fifth term, and won with fewer than nine thousand votes cast.[21] She was sworn in on November 19, 2008, giving her almost two months' more seniority than the rest of the 2008 House freshman class.[22][23]\n\n\nAfter the 2018 midterms, Fudge considered running for Speaker of the House in the 2019 election. She later abandoned the bid and supported Nancy Pelosi.[24]\n\n\nAfter the 2020 United States presidential election, Fudge and allies including Representative Jim Clyburn argued that she should be appointed as Secretary of Agriculture in the Biden administration. Fudge was quoted as saying, \"You know, it's always 'we want to put the Black person in Labor or HUD'.\"[25][26] Biden eventually selected Tom Vilsack as his agriculture secretary; he chose Fudge as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fudge during the 116th Congress\nFudge resigned from the House of Representatives after being confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on March 10, 2021.[28][29] A special election to replace her was held on November 2, 2021, with Shontel Brown elected to the seat.[30]\n\n\n\n### Congressional Black Caucus[edit]\n\n\nDuring a presentation at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 44th Annual Legislative Conference in September 2014, Fudge said the CBC would mobilize Black voters in the 2014 midterm elections by underscoring Republican attacks on President Obama, such as claims that he was not born in the United States.[31]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Energy, and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations (Chair)\n* Committee on House Administration\n\t+ Subcommittee on Elections (Chair)\n* Committee on Education and Labor\n\t+ Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Arts Caucus[32]\n* Congressional Black Caucus\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus[33]\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[34]\n* Medicare for All Caucus\n\n\n## Secretary of Housing and Urban Development[edit]\n\n\nVideo of Fudge being sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris\nOn December 10, 2020, President Biden announced his plan to nominate Fudge for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.[35] She appeared before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on January 28, 2021.[36] On February 4, committee chairman Sherrod Brown advanced her nomination after a 17–7 vote in favor.\n\n\nOn March 10, 2021, Fudge was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 66–34, garnering the support of every senator caucusing with the Democratic Party and 16 senators from the Republican caucus. She was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris hours after her confirmation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### Hatch Act violation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2021, during a White House press conference, Fudge made comments on the upcoming Senate election in her home state of Ohio suggesting that Democrats could win it. As a result, she was accused of violating the Hatch Act of 1939.[37][38] After an investigation, the Office of Special Counsel determined she had violated the Hatch Act. Fudge received a warning.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Racial impact of housing problems[edit]\n\n\nIn one of her first acts as secretary, Fudge discussed the effects of homelessness on people of color, evictions in the United States, and creating avenues for fair housing with civil rights leaders including Marc Morial and Al Sharpton.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOhio's 11th congressional district[42][43]\n| Year\n | Election\n | Subject\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008 | Special | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 8,597\n | 100%\n |  |  |\n| 2008 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 212,485\n | 85.2%\n | Thomas Pekarek\n | Republican | 36,705\n | 14.7%\n | Craig Willis\n | Independent | 144\n | 0.1%\n |\n| 2010 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 139,693\n | 82.9%\n | Thomas Pekarek\n | Republican | 28,754\n | 17.1%\n |  |\n| 2012 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 258,378\n | 100%\n |  |  |\n| 2014 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 132,396\n | 79.2%\n | Mark Zetzer\n | Republican | 34,769\n | 20.8%\n |  |\n| 2016 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 233,285\n | 80.1%\n | Beverly Goldstein | Republican | 58,066\n | 19.9%\n |  |\n| 2018 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 206,138\n | 81.9%\n | Beverly Goldstein | Republican | 48,866\n | 14.9%\n |  |\n| 2020 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 242,098\n | 80.1%\n | Laverne Gore\n | Republican | 60,323\n | 19.9%\n |  |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFudge was the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority from 1996 to 2000,[44][45] co-chair of the sorority's National Social Action Commission, and a member of its Greater Cleveland Alumnae Chapter.[46][47][48] In 2003, she was a member of the Shaker Heights Alumni Association's Hall of Fame Class.[9]\n\n\nFudge has been a member of the Glenville Church of God,[49] and is now a member of Zion Chapel Baptist Church.[13]\n\n\nIn 2015, Fudge wrote a letter asking for leniency in the sentencing of Cleveland politician Lance Mason on felony assault and domestic violence charges.[50] Fudge described Mason as \"kind\", and wrote that \"Lance [...] has assured me that something like this will never happen again.\"[50] Mason subsequently attacked and killed his ex-wife, in 2018, stabbing her 59 times.[51] After the murder, Fudge released a statement saying she condemned the crimes committed by Mason.[52]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States representatives\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* List of African-American United States Cabinet members\n* List of female United States Cabinet members\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Fudge Elected To Late Tubbs-Jones' Congressional Seat\".

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as the U.S. representative for Ohio's 11th congressional district from 2008 to 2021. The district includes most of the black-majority precincts between Cleveland and Akron.\n\n\nFollowing the death of Stephanie Tubbs Jones in 2008, Fudge ran unopposed in the special election to replace her.[1] She was chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 113th Congress.[2] She considered running for Speaker of the United States House of Representatives at the start of the 116th Congress but eventually announced she would back Nancy Pelosi.[3]\n\n\nThen president-elect Joe Biden nominated Fudge as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on December 10, 2020. The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs advanced her nomination by a vote of 17–7 on February 4, 2021.[4] She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021, by a vote of 66–34.[5] She was virtually sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 10, 2021.[6] Upon taking her oath of office, she became the second African-American woman to serve as secretary of housing and urban development.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFudge was born in Cleveland Ohio, on October 29, 1952.[8] A 1971 graduate of Shaker Heights High School,[9] she earned her Bachelor of Science in business from the Ohio State University in 1975.[10] In 1983, she earned a Juris Doctor from the Cleveland State University College of Law.[11]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nAfter college, she worked as a law clerk and studied legal research. She also worked in the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office as Director of Budget and Finance.[12] Fudge has also worked as an auditor for the county's estate tax department and has occasionally served as a visiting judge and as a chief referee for arbitration.[13]\n\n\nFudge was the mayor of Warrensville Heights, Ohio, from 2000 to November 18, 2008.[14][15] Her 1999 campaign was her first run for any elected office. She was the town's first female and first African American mayor.[16]\n\n\nFudge served as chief of staff to U.S. Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones during Jones's first term in Congress.[17] She has also served on the board of trustees for the Cleveland Public Library.[16]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAfter Stephanie Tubbs Jones's death on August 20, 2008, a committee of local Democratic leaders selected Fudge as her replacement on the November ballot. This virtually assured her election in the heavily Democratic, black-majority district.[18][19] Fudge won the November 4 general election, defeating Republican Thomas Pekarek with 85% of the vote.[20] She was unopposed in a November 18 special election for the balance of Jones's fifth term, and won with fewer than nine thousand votes cast.[21] She was sworn in on November 19, 2008, giving her almost two months' more seniority than the rest of the 2008 House freshman class.[22][23]\n\n\nAfter the 2018 midterms, Fudge considered running for Speaker of the House in the 2019 election. She later abandoned the bid and supported Nancy Pelosi.[24]\n\n\nAfter the 2020 United States presidential election, Fudge and allies including Representative Jim Clyburn argued that she should be appointed as Secretary of Agriculture in the Biden administration. Fudge was quoted as saying, \"You know, it's always 'we want to put the Black person in Labor or HUD'.\"[25][26] Biden eventually selected Tom Vilsack as his agriculture secretary; he chose Fudge as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.[26][27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fudge during the 116th Congress\nFudge resigned from the House of Representatives after being confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on March 10, 2021.[28][29] A special election to replace her was held on November 2, 2021, with Shontel Brown elected to the seat.[30]\n\n\n\n### Congressional Black Caucus[edit]\n\n\nDuring a presentation at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's 44th Annual Legislative Conference in September 2014, Fudge said the CBC would mobilize Black voters in the 2014 midterm elections by underscoring Republican attacks on President Obama, such as claims that he was not born in the United States.[31]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Energy, and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations (Chair)\n* Committee on House Administration\n\t+ Subcommittee on Elections (Chair)\n* Committee on Education and Labor\n\t+ Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Human Services\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Arts Caucus[32]\n* Congressional Black Caucus\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus[33]\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[34]\n* Medicare for All Caucus\n\n\n## Secretary of Housing and Urban Development[edit]\n\n\nVideo of Fudge being sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris\nOn December 10, 2020, President Biden announced his plan to nominate Fudge for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.[35] She appeared before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on January 28, 2021.[36] On February 4, committee chairman Sherrod Brown advanced her nomination after a 17–7 vote in favor.\n\n\nOn March 10, 2021, Fudge was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 66–34, garnering the support of every senator caucusing with the Democratic Party and 16 senators from the Republican caucus. She was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris hours after her confirmation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### Hatch Act violation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2021, during a White House press conference, Fudge made comments on the upcoming Senate election in her home state of Ohio suggesting that Democrats could win it. As a result, she was accused of violating the Hatch Act of 1939.[37][38] After an investigation, the Office of Special Counsel determined she had violated the Hatch Act. Fudge received a warning.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Racial impact of housing problems[edit]\n\n\nIn one of her first acts as secretary, Fudge discussed the effects of homelessness on people of color, evictions in the United States, and creating avenues for fair housing with civil rights leaders including Marc Morial and Al Sharpton.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOhio's 11th congressional district[42][43]\n| Year\n | Election\n | Subject\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008 | Special | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 8,597\n | 100%\n |  |  |\n| 2008 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 212,485\n | 85.2%\n | Thomas Pekarek\n | Republican | 36,705\n | 14.7%\n | Craig Willis\n | Independent | 144\n | 0.1%\n |\n| 2010 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 139,693\n | 82.9%\n | Thomas Pekarek\n | Republican | 28,754\n | 17.1%\n |  |\n| 2012 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 258,378\n | 100%\n |  |  |\n| 2014 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 132,396\n | 79.2%\n | Mark Zetzer\n | Republican | 34,769\n | 20.8%\n |  |\n| 2016 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 233,285\n | 80.1%\n | Beverly Goldstein | Republican | 58,066\n | 19.9%\n |  |\n| 2018 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 206,138\n | 81.9%\n | Beverly Goldstein | Republican | 48,866\n | 14.9%\n |  |\n| 2020 | General | **Marcia Fudge** | Democratic | 242,098\n | 80.1%\n | Laverne Gore\n | Republican | 60,323\n | 19.9%\n |  |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nFudge was the president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority from 1996 to 2000,[44][45] co-chair of the sorority's National Social Action Commission, and a member of its Greater Cleveland Alumnae Chapter.[46][47][48] In 2003, she was a member of the Shaker Heights Alumni Association's Hall of Fame Class.[9]\n\n\nFudge has been a member of the Glenville Church of God,[49] and is now a member of Zion Chapel Baptist Church.[13]\n\n\nIn 2015, Fudge wrote a letter asking for leniency in the sentencing of Cleveland politician Lance Mason on felony assault and domestic violence charges.[50] Fudge described Mason as \"kind\", and wrote that \"Lance [...] has assured me that something like this will never happen again.\"[50] Mason subsequently attacked and killed his ex-wife, in 2018, stabbing her 59 times.[51] After the murder, Fudge released a statement saying she condemned the crimes committed by Mason.[52]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States representatives\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* List of African-American United States Cabinet members\n* List of female United States Cabinet members\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Fudge Elected To Late Tubbs-Jones' Congressional Seat\".

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 32nd mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020, which earned him the nickname \"**Mayor Pete**\".\n\n\nButtigieg is a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Oxford, attending the latter on a Rhodes Scholarship. From 2009 to 2017, he was an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve, attaining the rank of lieutenant. He was mobilized and deployed to the War in Afghanistan for seven months in 2014. Before being elected as mayor of South Bend in 2011, Buttigieg worked on the political campaigns of Democrats Jill Long Thompson, Joe Donnelly, and John Kerry, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic nominee for Indiana state treasurer in 2010. While serving as South Bend's mayor, Buttigieg came out as gay in 2015. He married Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher and writer, in June 2018. Buttigieg declined to seek a third term as mayor.\n\n\nButtigieg ran as a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, launching his campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election on April 14, 2019. He became one of the first openly gay men to launch a major party presidential campaign.[b] Despite initially low expectations, he gained significant momentum in mid-2019 when he participated in several town hall meetings and television debates. Buttigieg narrowly won the Iowa caucuses and placed a close second in the New Hampshire primary.[4][5][6] By winning Iowa, he became the first openly gay candidate to win a presidential primary or caucus. Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Joe Biden the following day.\n\n\nPresident-elect Biden named Buttigieg as his nominee for Secretary of Transportation in December 2020. His nomination was confirmed on February 2, 2021, by a vote of 86–13, making him the first openly gay Cabinet secretary in U.S. history.[c] Nominated at age 38, he is also the youngest Cabinet member in the Biden administration and the youngest person ever to serve as Secretary of Transportation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nPete Buttigieg, the only child of Jennifer Anne (Montgomery) and Joseph Anthony Buttigieg II, was born on January 19, 1982, in South Bend, Indiana. His mother uses the name Anne Montgomery.[8][9][10][11] His parents met and married while employed as faculty at New Mexico State University.[12] His father was born in Hamrun, Malta, and emigrated to the United States to pursue his doctorate.[13][14] Buttigieg's father embarked on a career as a professor of English at the University of Notre Dame near South Bend.[14][15] Buttigieg's mother also taught at the University of Notre Dame for 29 years.[16] His father was a translator and editor of the three-volume English edition of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci's *Prison Notebooks* and influenced his pursuit of literature in college.[17]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg was valedictorian of the class of 2000 at St. Joseph High School in South Bend.[18][19] That year, he won first prize in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum's *Profiles in Courage* essay contest. He traveled to Boston to accept the award and met Caroline Kennedy and other members of President Kennedy's family. The subject of his winning essay was the integrity and political courage of then U.S. representative Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of only two independent politicians in Congress.[20][21][d] In 2000, Buttigieg was also chosen as one of two student delegates from Indiana to the United States Senate Youth Program,[23] an annual scholarship competition sponsored jointly by the U.S. Senate and the Hearst Foundations.[24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from St. Joseph High School, Buttigieg attended Harvard University, where he majored in history and literature.[25] He became president of the Student Advisory Committee of the Harvard Institute of Politics and worked on the institute's annual study of youth attitudes on politics.[26][27] He wrote his undergraduate thesis, titled *The Quiet American's Errand into the Wilderness*, on the influence of Puritanism on U.S. foreign policy as reflected in Graham Greene's novel *The Quiet American*.[28][29] He graduated *magna cum laude* from Harvard in 2004, and was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[30][31]\n\n\nButtigieg was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford.[30][32] In 2007, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics after studying at Pembroke College, Oxford.[33][34][35][36] At Oxford, he was an editor of the *Oxford International Review*,[37] and was a co-founder[37] and member of the Democratic Renaissance Project, an informal debate and discussion group of approximately a dozen Oxford students.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Professional career[edit]\n\n\nBefore graduating from college, Buttigieg was an investigative intern at WMAQ-TV, Chicago's NBC News affiliate.[40] He also interned for Democrat Jill Long Thompson during her unsuccessful 2002 congressional bid.[41]\n\n\nAfter college, Buttigieg worked on John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign as a policy and research specialist for several months in Arizona and New Mexico.[42][43] From 2004 to 2005, Buttigieg was conference director of the Cohen Group.[44] In 2006, he lent assistance to Joe Donnelly's successful congressional campaign.[45]\n\n\nAfter earning his Oxford degree, in 2007 Buttigieg became a consultant at the Chicago office of McKinsey & Company,[46][47] where he worked on energy, retail, economic development, and logistics for three years.[48][49] His clients at McKinsey included the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, electronics retailer Best Buy, Canadian supermarket chain Loblaws, two nonprofit environmentalist groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Energy Foundation, and several U.S. government agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Energy Department, Defense Department, and Postal Service.[50][51] He took a leave of absence from McKinsey in 2008 to become research director for Jill Long Thompson's unsuccessful campaign for Indiana governor.[52][53][54] His work at McKinsey included trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, which he rarely discusses.[55] Buttigieg left McKinsey in 2010 in order to focus full-time on his campaign for Indiana state treasurer.[46]\n\n\nButtigieg has been involved with the Truman National Security Project since 2005 and serves as a fellow with expertise in Afghanistan and Pakistan.[48] He was named to the organization's board of advisors in 2014.[56][26]\n\n\n\n### Military service[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg joined the U.S. Navy Reserve through the direct commission officer (DCO) program and was sworn in as an ensign in naval intelligence in September 2009.[57] He took a seven-month leave during his mayoral term to deploy to Afghanistan in 2014.[58][59][60][61] While there, Buttigieg was part of a unit assigned to identify and disrupt terrorist finance networks. Part of this was done at Bagram Air Base, but he was also an armed driver for his commander on more than 100 trips into Kabul. Buttigieg has jokingly referred to his role as an armed driver as \"military Uber\", because he had to watch out for ambushes and explosive devices along the roads and ensure that the vehicle was guarded.[62] Also, while deployed in Afghanistan, Buttigieg was assigned to the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a counterterrorism unit that targeted Taliban insurgency financing.[63][64] Buttigieg was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal,[65] and he left the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2017.[66][67][68]\n\n\n\n### Indiana state treasurer election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Indiana State Treasurer election\n\n![](image)Buttigieg campaign photo for Indiana State Treasurer in March 2010\nButtigieg was the Democratic nominee for state treasurer of Indiana in 2010. He received 37.5 percent of the vote, losing to Republican incumbent Richard Mourdock.[69][70] Much of Buttigieg's campaign had focused on criticizing Mourdock for investing state pension funds in Chrysler junk bonds, and for having subsequently filed a lawsuit against Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring, which Buttigieg argued imperiled Chrysler jobs in the state of Indiana.[71][72][73]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of South Bend[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mayoralty of Pete Buttigieg\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\nShortly after losing the 2010 Indiana State Treasurer election, Buttigieg ran for the Democratic nomination for mayor of South Bend in 2011. In a PBS Michiana – WNIT broadcast, he expressed his desire to reinvigorate South Bend, especially with respect to job creation and education.[74] Buttigieg campaigned on other issues, such as pursuing international investment,[75] increasing presence of police and other safety professionals,[76] and improving city services.[77] Buttigieg won his primary election against four opponents on May 3, 2011,[78] receiving 7,663 votes.[78]\nButtigieg was elected mayor of South Bend in the November 2011 general election with 10,991 of the 14,883 votes cast, or 74 percent of all votes.[79] He defeated Republican nominee Norris W. Curry Jr. and Libertarian nominee Patrick M. Farrell.[80] Buttigieg took office in January 2012 at the age of 29, becoming the second-youngest mayor in South Bend history[e] and the youngest incumbent mayor, at the time, of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents.[79]\n\n\nBefore Buttigieg took office, Jiha'd Vasquez, a 16-year-old black boy, was found hanging from an electrical tower on April 14, 2011.[82][83] Vasquez's backpack, on the ground near his body, had several items missing, according to Vasquez's mother Stephanie Jones.[82] The coroner, Chuck Hurley, who had no medical experience, claimed Vasquez's death was a suicide; Buttigieg later appointed Hurley to serve as interim police chief.[82] Vasquez's body was cremated without an autopsy being conducted.[82] Jones attempted to get Buttigieg to investigate her son's death.[82] According to Jones, Buttigieg told her to call his office, but she never got a response.[82] Jones and South Bend NAACP legal redress chairman Tom Bush claimed the event was a cover-up, with Bush saying he suspected the Ku Klux Klan may be involved and hoped for a federal investigation, but did not expect it, saying \"the only reason this will get done is if you're on a microphone yelling and screaming.\"[84] When Buttigieg's presidential campaign was asked about the incident by a reporter in 2019, they did not give a response.[82] In 2019, Jones and St. Joseph County coroner Mike McGann argued that the case should be reopened; however, sheriff William Redman said he would not consider reopening the case unless further evidence came to light.[84]\n\n\nAfter a federal investigation ruled that South Bend police had illegally recorded telephone calls of several officers, Buttigieg demoted police chief Darryl Boykins in 2012.[85][f] Buttigieg also dismissed the department's communications director, who had discovered the recordings but continued to record the line at Boykins's command.[85] The police communications director alleged that the recordings captured four senior police officers making racist remarks and discussing illegal acts.[85][87]\n\n\nButtigieg has written that his \"first serious mistake as mayor\" came shortly after taking office in 2012, when he decided to ask for Boykins's resignation. Backed by supporters and legal counsel, Boykins requested reinstatement. When Buttigieg denied his request, Boykins, as the city's first African-American police chief, sued the city for racial discrimination,[88] arguing that the taping policy had existed under previous police chiefs, who were white.[89] Buttigieg settled the lawsuits brought by Boykins and the four officers out of court for over $800,000.[85][90] A federal judge ruled in 2015 that Boykins's recordings violated the Federal Wiretap Act.[87] Buttigieg came under pressure from political opponents to release the eight tapes, but he said that it was not possible to release seven of them, citing the Federal Wiretap Act.[85][87] It was unclear if releasing the eighth tape would violate any laws.[87] St. Joseph County Superior Court Judge Steve Hostetler heard a case for the release of five cassette tapes.[89] Judge Hostetler ruled that the cassette tapes must be released to the South Bend City Council in May 2021.[91]\n\n\nAs mayor, Buttigieg promoted a number of development and redevelopment projects.[92] Buttigieg was a leading figure behind the creation of a nightly laser-light display along downtown South Bend's St. Joseph River trail as public art. The project cost $700,000, which was raised from private funds.[93] The \"River Lights\" installation was unveiled in May 2015 as part of the city's 150th anniversary celebrations.[85] He also oversaw the city's launching of a 3-1-1 system in 2013.[94][95] Buttigieg's administration oversaw the sale of numerous city-owned properties.[96][97][98][99] One of Buttigieg's signature programs was the \"Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative\". Known locally as *1,000 Properties in 1,000 Days*, it was a project to repair or demolish blighted properties across South Bend.[100][101] The program reached its goal two months before its scheduled end date in November 2015.[102] By the thousandth day of the program, before Buttigieg's first term ended, nearly 40 percent of the targeted houses were repaired, and 679 were demolished or under contract for demolition.[103] Buttigieg took note of the fact that many homes within communities of color were the ones demolished, leading to early distrust between the city and these communities.[104]\n\n\nWhile mayor, Buttigieg served for seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, returning to the United States on September 23, 2014.[105] In his absence, Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, South Bend's city comptroller, served as executive from February 2014 until Buttigieg returned to his role as mayor in October 2014.[79][105][106]\n\n\nIn 2015, during the controversy over Indiana Senate Bill 101 – the original version of which was widely criticized for allowing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people – Buttigieg emerged as a leading opponent of the legislation. Amid his reelection campaign, he came out as gay and expressed his solidarity with the LGBTQ community.[107][108]\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg announced in 2014 that he would seek a second term in 2015.[109] He won the Democratic primary with approximately 78 percent of the vote, defeating Henry Davis Jr., the city councilman from the second district.[110] In November 2015, he was elected to his second term as mayor with over 80 percent of the vote, defeating Republican Kelly Jones by a margin of 8,515 to 2,074 votes.[111] After winning reelection, Buttigieg signed an executive order helping to establish a recognized city identification card in 2016.[112][113]\n\n\nTo improve South Bend's downtown area, Buttigieg proposed a Smart Streets urban development program in 2013.[85] In early 2015 – after traffic studies and public hearings – he secured a bond issue for the program backed by tax increment financing.[114][115] Smart Streets was a complete streets implementation program[116] aimed at improving economic development and urban vibrancy as well as road safety.[117] Elements of the project were finished in 2016,[85] and was officially completed in 2017.[117] The project was credited with spurring private development in the city.[115]\n\n\nIn a new phase of the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative, South Bend partnered with the Notre Dame Clinical Law Center to provide free legal assistance to qualifying applicants wishing to acquire vacant lots and, with local nonprofits, to repair or construct homes and provide low-income home ownership assistance using South Bend Housing and Urban Development funds.[118][119]\n\n\n\n![](image)Studebaker Building 84 in 2014\nThe City of South Bend partnered with the State of Indiana and private developers to break ground on a $165 million renovation of the former Studebaker complex in 2016, hoping that the redevelopment would facilitate industrial and housing units.[120] This development is in the Renaissance District, which includes nearby Ignition Park.[121][122] In 2017, it was announced that the long-abandoned Studebaker Building 84, also known as *Ivy Tower*, would have its exterior renovated with $3.5 million in Regional Cities funds from the State of Indiana and another $3.5 million from South Bend tax increment financing, with plans for the building and other structures in its complex to serve as a technology hub.[123] The website *Best Cities* later ranked South Bend number 39 on its 2020 list of the 100 best small cities in the United States, citing Buttigieg's efforts to revitalize the Studebaker factory and Downtown South Bend.[124]\n\n\nUnder Buttigieg, the city also began a smart sewer program, the first phase of which was finished in 2017 at a cost of $150 million.[121] The effort used federal funds[125] and by 2019 had reduced the combined sewer overflow by 75 percent.[121] The impetus for the effort was a fine that the EPA had levied against the city in 2011 for Clean Water Act violations.[121] In 2019, Buttigieg asked for the city to be released from an agreement with the EPA brokered under his mayoral predecessor Steve Luecke, in which South Bend had agreed to make hundreds of millions dollars in further improvements to its sewer system by 2031.[126]\n\n\nThe Common Council approved Buttigieg's request to enable his administration to develop a city climate plan in April 2019; Buttigieg signed a contract with the Chicago firm Delta Institute to help develop it.[127] In late November 2019, the city's Common Council voted 7–0 to approve the resultant Carbon Neutral 2050 plan, setting the goal of meeting the Paris Agreement's 26 percent emission reduction by 2025, and aiming for a further reductions of 45 percent by 2035.[128]\n\n\nSupporting private development in South Bend was another initiative Buttigieg continued during his second term.[129][130][131][132][133] By 2019, the city had seen $374 million in private investment for mixed-use developments since Buttigieg had taken office, by one estimate.[134][93] By another account, Downtown South Bend saw roughly $200 million in private investment during Buttigieg's tenure.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2018, Buttigieg proposed moving the city's South Shore Line station, from the airport to downtown\nWith respect to infrastructure, Buttigieg promoted the idea of moving the city's South Shore Line station from South Bend International Airport to the city's downtown in August 2018.[136] He made it a goal to have the city complete this project by 2025.[137] Also, South Bend launched Commuters Trust, a new transportation benefit program created in collaboration with local employers and transportation providers, including South Bend Transpo and Lyft, in 2019. The program was made possible by a $1 million three-year grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge.[138][139] Furthermore, under Buttigieg, South Bend invested $50 million in the city's parks, many of which had been neglected during the preceding decades.[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protestors marching in response to the death of Eric Logan\nAfter a white South Bend police officer shot and killed Eric Logan, an African-American man, in June 2019, Buttigieg was drawn from his presidential campaign to focus on the emerging public reaction. Police body cameras were not turned on during Logan's death.[140] Soon after Logan's death, Buttigieg presided over a town hall meeting attended by disaffected activists from the African-American community as well as relatives of the deceased man. The local police union accused Buttigieg of making decisions for political gain.[141][142] Buttigieg secured $180,000 in November 2019 to commission a review of South Bend's police department policies and practices, to be conducted by Chicago-based consulting firm 21CP Solutions.[143]\n\n\nMany African-Americans have accused Buttigieg of racism for his response to this and other incidents. Former South Bend councilman Henry Davis Jr. alleged that Buttigieg \"perpetuated and tolerated\" systemic racism in the city. Michael Harriot, senior writer at The Root, accused Buttigieg of \"racist paternalism\" for saying that children of color lack role models that promote the value of education. Many African-Americans also point to Buttigieg's firing of Darryl Boykins, South Bend's first black chief of police. Boykins claimed that Buttigieg used a scandal—involving secret tapes of white police officers making racist comments—as a pretext for firing him.[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n#### Increased national profile[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana, he campaigned on behalf of Democratic Senate nominee Evan Bayh[147] and criticized Bayh's opponent, Todd Young, for having voiced support in 2010 for retaining the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, which Bayh had voted to repeal.[148] In the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Buttigieg endorsed Hillary Clinton.[149] He also endorsed Democratic nominee Lynn Coleman in that year's election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district, which included South Bend.[150]\n\n\nFrank Bruni of *The New York Times* published a 2016 column praising Buttigieg's work as mayor, with a headline asking if he might be \"the first gay president\".[151] Barack Obama cited him as one of the Democratic Party's talents in a November 2016 profile on the outgoing president conducted by *The New Yorker*.[152] As Buttigieg's national profile grew following his run in the 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, Buttigieg increased his out-of-city travel.[153] By early 2018, there was speculation that Buttigieg would run for either governor or president in 2020.[154][155]\n\n\nFor the 2018 midterms, Buttigieg founded the political action committee (PAC) Hitting Home PAC.[156] That October, Buttigieg personally endorsed 21 congressional candidates.[157] He also later endorsed Mel Hall, Democratic nominee in the 2018 election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district.[158] Buttigieg campaigned for Joe Donnelly's reelection campaign in the United States Senate election in Indiana.[159] Buttigieg campaigned for candidates in more than a dozen states, including early presidential primary states such as Iowa and South Carolina, a move indicating potential interest in running for president.[157] He officially announced his run on January 23, 2019.[160]\n\n\n\n#### Succession as mayor[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg announced that he would not seek a third term as mayor of South Bend in December 2018.[161] Buttigieg endorsed James Mueller in the 2019 South Bend mayoral election.[162][163] Mueller was a high-school classmate of Buttigieg's and his mayoral chief of staff, and later executive director of the South Bend Department of Community Investment.[162] Mueller's campaign promised to continue the progress that had been made under Buttigieg's mayoralty.[164] Buttigieg appeared in campaign advertisements for Mueller and donated to Mueller's campaign.[165] Mueller won the May 2019 Democratic primary with 37 percent of the vote in a crowded field.[166][162][167] In the November 2019 general election, Mueller defeated Republican nominee Sean M. Haas with 63 percent of the vote.[168][169] Mueller took office on New Year's Day 2020.[10]\n\n\n\n## DNC chairmanship campaign[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election\n\n![](image)Buttigieg campaigning for DNC chairman in 2017\nIn January 2017, Buttigieg announced his candidacy for chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in its 2017 chairmanship election.[170] He built a national profile as an emerging dark horse in the race for the chairmanship with the backing of former DNC chairman Howard Dean, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, Indiana senator Joe Donnelly, and North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp.[171][172] Buttigieg campaigned on the need for the Democratic Party to empower its millennial members.[171]\n\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and U.S. representative Keith Ellison quickly emerged as the favored candidates of a majority of DNC members. Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election without endorsing a candidate, and Perez was elected chairman after two rounds of voting.[171]\n\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pete Buttigieg 2020 presidential campaign\n\nFurther information: 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n\n![](image)Buttigieg announcing his candidacy for president in 2020 on April 14, 2019\nOn January 23, 2019, Buttigieg announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the upcoming 2020 election.[173] Buttigieg sought the Democratic Party nomination for president.[174][175] If he had been elected, he would have been the youngest and first openly gay American president.[173] Amid the start of Buttigieg's presidential effort, on February 12, 2019, he published his debut book, autobiography *Shortest Way Home*.[176] Two months later, Buttigieg officially launched his campaign on April 14, 2019, in South Bend.[177][178]\n\n\nButtigieg described himself as a progressive and a supporter of democratic capitalism.[179] Historian David Mislin identifies Buttigieg as a pragmatic progressive in the tradition of the Social Gospel movement once strong in the Midwest.[180] Buttigieg identifies regulatory capture as a significant problem in American society.[179]\n\n\nInitially regarded as a long-shot candidate,[181][182][183] Buttigieg rose into the top-tier of candidates in the primary by December 2019.[184] In early February 2020, Buttigieg led the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses results with 26.2 percent to Bernie Sanders' 26.1 percent, winning 14 delegates to Sanders's 12.[185][186] The LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg's first national endorsement,[g] noted the historical first of an openly gay candidate winning a state presidential primary.[187] Buttigieg finished second behind Sanders in the New Hampshire primary.[5] After placing a fourth in the South Carolina primary with 8.2 percent of the vote, behind Joe Biden (48.7 percent), Bernie Sanders (19.8 percent), and Tom Steyer (11.3 percent), Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Biden.[188][189]\n\n\n\n### Post-presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Buttigieg launched Win The Era PAC, a new super PAC to raise money and distribute it to down-ballot Democrats.[190] The PAC focused on local elected positions, and its list of endorsements included candidates such as Jaime Harrison, Cal Cunningham, Gina Ortiz Jones, Christine Hunschofsky, and Levar Stoney.[191] On June 8, 2020, the University of Notre Dame announced that it had hired Buttigieg as a teacher and researcher for the 2020–21 academic year.[192] Also, in October 2020, Buttigieg released his second book, *Trust: America's Best Chance*.[193]\n\n\nButtigieg acted as a surrogate for Biden's campaign in the general election.[194][195] He delivered a speech on the closing night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention,[196] and also announced Indiana's votes during the convention's roll call.[197] On September 5, 2020, Buttigieg was announced to be a member of the advisory council of the Biden-Harris Transition Team, which was planning the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[198][199] Ahead of the vice presidential debate, Buttigieg played the role as a stand-in for Republican vice president Mike Pence in Democratic to prepare vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Buttigieg was selected to perform this role because of his experience working with Pence during their simultaneous tenures as mayor of South Bend and governor of Indiana, respectively.[200]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Buttigieg as Transportation secretary on February 3, 2021\nFollowing the end of his presidential campaign, Buttigieg was considered a possible Cabinet appointee in Joe Biden's administration.[201][202] After Biden was declared the winner of the election on November 7, 2020, Buttigieg was again mentioned as a possible nominee for Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to China or Secretary of Transportation.[203] On December 15, 2020, Biden announced that he would nominate Buttigieg as his Secretary of Transportation.[204][205][206] The Senate Commerce Committee advanced Buttigieg's nomination to the full Senate with a vote of 21–3.[207] Buttigieg was confirmed on February 2, 2021, with a vote of 86–13;[208] and was sworn in the next morning.[209]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg visits Washington Union Station on his first full day as Secretary of Transportation\nAs Secretary of Transportation, Buttigieg has worked on re-organizing the department's internal policy structure, including carrying out a thorough review process of rules enacted under the Trump administration.[210][211] For example, Buttigieg reinstated an Obama-era pilot program which ensures local hiring for public works projects on May 19, 2021, with the goal of helping minorities and disadvantaged individuals. This program had been revoked in 2017 during the Trump administration, when the Department of Transportation returned to rules established during the Reagan administration, which banned geographic-based hiring preferences.[212]\n\n\nButtigieg addressed the African American Mayors Association in late February 2021 to discuss systemic racism. He argued that misguided investments in the federal transport and infrastructure policy had contributed to racial inequity.[213] In early March 2021, *Politico* noted that Buttigieg had mentioned racial equity in almost every interview he gave to the press as it related to his work at the department.[214] In late June 2022, Buttigieg launched a $1 billion Reconnecting Communities pilot program to establish racial equity in roads.[215] Using money from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the program aims to reconnect cities and neighborhoods divided by roads through projects such as rapid bus lines, pedestrian walkways, and planning studies.[216]\n\n\nEarly into his tenure, Buttigieg noted that the United States's actions surrounding road traffic safety is lacking and suggested improving the design of roads. Also, while acknowledging how the United States fell behind other developed countries with respect to bicycle and pedestrian safety, Buttigieg encouraged greater focus on human behavior in infrastructure policy.[217][218] Likewise, in March 2021, Buttigieg indicated he was open to tolls on Interstate 80, but not the tollage of bridges, suggesting \"big picture solutions\" instead, like a mileage tax.[219][220] However, the Biden administration did not include a gas tax or mileage tax in the infrastructure plan it released that month.[221]\n\n\nButtigieg informed Congress in late March 2021 that the Biden administration was planning to prioritize the construction of the Gateway Rail Tunnel Project due to its economic significance.[222] The progress of the project, which was stalled by President Trump,[223] was said to be moving faster, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Buttigieg announced the environmental impact assessment of the project—which was largely seen as a sign of major progress on the project.[224] Also, Buttigieg has served as a promoter of the American Jobs Plan[225] and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg and Barack Obama at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 9, 2021\nIn June 2021, the White House created a task force to address supply chain disruptions, with Buttigieg as one of its leaders.[227] By October 2021, global supply bottlenecks had resulted in record shortages of household goods for American consumers. Buttigieg cited high demand and the pandemic as some of the causes for the disruptions, while predicting that the disruptions would \"continue into next year\".[228][229]\n\n\nAfter the 2021 birth of his twins, Buttigieg took a parental leave. This became a point of prominent criticism and ridicule from conservative and Republican figures. Some political analysts have noted homophobic tones to the attacks on Buttigieg's decision to take a parental leave.[230] After conservatives criticized him for taking a paternity leave, Buttigieg declared that he would not apologize for \"taking care of my premature newborn infant twins. The work that we are doing is joyful, fulfilling, wonderful work.\"[231] According to his department, Buttigieg had been on paid leave since mid-August 2021, where for a month he was \"mostly offline except for major agency decisions and matters that could not be delegated\", and he \"has been ramping up activities since then\", making many media appearances in early October 2021.[232] The White House had approved Buttigieg's leave.[231]\n\n\nAfter passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, *Insider* called Buttigieg \"the most powerful transportation secretary ever\", as the department now has $210 billion of discretionary grants to award.[233]\n\n\nBy early 2023, Buttigieg faced criticisms regarding several instances of serious issues that had occurred in United States passenger aviation during his time as Secretary of Transportation.[234]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg in East Palestine, Ohio on February 23, 2023\nOn February 3, 2023, a freight train carrying vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether derailed along the Norfolk Southern Railway in East Palestine, Ohio. Emergency crews conducted a controlled burn of the spill at the request of state officials, which released hydrogen chloride and phosgene into the air. As a result, residents within a 1 mi (1.6 km) radius were evacuated. Buttigieg tweeted on February 13 the Department would \"use all relevant authorities to ensure accountability and continue to support safety.\"[235] On February 23, 2023, NTSB released a preliminary report stating that the wheel bearings overheated, with temperatures as high as 253 °F (123 °C) above the ambient temperature.[236] In the weeks following the derailment, the Transportation Department, under Buttigieg, did not move to reinstate the 2015 rail safety rule aimed at expanding the use of better braking technology. Buttigieg's Transportation Department was contemplating stripping down brake safety rules even further.[237] Buttigieg has faced criticism from figures on different ends of the political spectrum for his response to the derailment, receiving criticism from Democrats such as Nina Turner and Ilhan Omar and Republicans such as J. D. Vance and Anna Paulina Luna.[238] Republican senator Marco Rubio called for Buttigieg to resign, and criticized him for not having yet visiting the disaster site at the time.[239] Former president Donald Trump also criticized Buttigieg for not having yet visited the site while conducting a visit of his own.[240] In March 2023, Buttigieg appeared on CNN, telling the cable news network that he had failed to anticipated the fallout from the derailment and erred in not visiting East Palestine sooner.[241][242]\n\n\nOn May 8, 2023, President Biden and Secretary Buttigieg announced an expansion of flightsright.gov, a website which informs airline customers of the compensation they are entitled to after flight cancellations or delays.\n[243]\nButtigieg supports The Junk Fee Prevention Act. If enacted on the federal level it would lower fees relating to spending money on some forms of entertainment, hotel rooms, airport related services, and travel.[244]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Pete Buttigieg\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nDuring his 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination, Buttigieg proposed spending $1 trillion on U.S. infrastructure projects over the next ten years, estimating that the plan would create at least six million jobs. The plan focused on green energy, protecting tap water from lead, fixing roads and bridges, improving public transportation, repairing schools, guaranteeing broadband internet access, and preparing communities for floods and other natural disasters.[245][246][247]\n\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports abortion rights[248][249] and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother is in danger.[250] He favors amending civil rights legislation, including the Federal Equality Act so that LGBT Americans receive federal non-discrimination protections.[251]\n\n\nButtigieg supports expanding opportunities for national service, including a voluntary year of national service for those turning 18 years old.[252][253][254]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Buttigieg shared his \"Douglass Plan\", named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to address systemic racism in America.[255] The initiative would allocate $10 billion to African-American entrepreneurship over five years, grant $25 billion to historically black colleges, legalize marijuana, expunge drug convictions, halve the federal prison population, and propose a federal New Voting Rights Act designed to increase voting access.[256][255]\n\n\nButtigieg supports abolishing the death penalty,[257] moving toward reversing criminal sentences for minor drug-related offenses,[258] and eliminating incarceration for drug possession offenses.[259]\n\n\nIn 2019, Buttigieg called for the United States to decriminalize mental illness and addiction via initiatives such as re-entry programs.[260] Also, he aspired to decrease incarceration rates because of mental illnesses or substance use by 75 percent during his first term as President of the United States.[261][260]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg favors the abolition of the Electoral College[262] and has also called for restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences.[258][263]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance reform[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports a constitutional amendment on campaign finance to reduce the undue influence of money in politics.[264] During his 2020 presidential run, in response to accusation of campaign finance concerns, Buttigieg's campaign told *Newsweek* that he did not accept contributions from individuals and organizations such as corporate political action committees.[265] In addition, Buttigieg's campaign emphasized that Buttigieg had included critical campaign finance reforms as part of his campaign platform, including pushing to overturn *Citizens United* and *Buckley v. Valeo*.[265]\n\n\n\n### Statehood advocacy[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports statehood for the District of Columbia, and said that he would support Puerto Rico statehood if desired by the Puerto Rican people.[262]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg at a town hall meeting in Des Moines on October 12, 2019, with supporters holding signs saying \"Climate is a Crisis\"\nDuring his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Buttigieg stated that, if elected, he would restore the United States' commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and double its pledge to the Green Climate Fund. He also supports the Green New Deal proposed by House Democrats,[266][267] solar panel subsidies, and a carbon tax and dividend policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[268][269]\n\n\n\n### Economic beliefs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg speaking at the 2019 Iowa Federation of Labor Convention\nButtigieg identifies as a democratic capitalist and has decried crony capitalism.[270] He has entertained the possibility of antitrust actions against large technology companies on the basis of privacy and data security concerns.[271] During the Democratic primary, he supported deficit and debt reduction, arguing that large debt makes it harder to invest in infrastructure, health and safety.[272]\n\n\n\n### Workers' rights[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, he released a plan to strengthen union bargaining power, to raise the minimum wage to $15, and to offer national paid family leave.[273]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg speaking to the Iowa State Education Association in 2020\nButtigieg's education plan includes a $700 billion investment in universal full-day child care and pre-kindergarten for all children from infancy to age five.[274] Buttigieg has also proposed tripling Title I funding for schools serving students predominately from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.[275] Other goals include doubling the amount of new teachers of color in the next 10 years, addressing school segregation with a $500 million fund, paying teachers more, expanding mental health services in schools, and creating more after-school programs and summer learning opportunities.[274]\n\n\nHis plan for debt-free college has called for expanding Pell Grants for low-income students, as well as other investments and reversing Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy.[276] Under Buttigieg's college plan, the bottom 80 percent of students with respect to income would have received free education, while the top 20 percent would have paid for at least some portion of their tuition.[277] Buttigieg has opposed free college tuition for all students because he has believed universally free tuition unfairly subsidizes higher-income families at the expense of lower-income individuals who do not attend college.[278] This position distinguished Buttigieg from his competitors in the 2020 presidential election.[278]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg speaking with VoteVets.org in 2019\nButtigieg called for modifying the structure of defense spending,[279] while suggesting that he might favor an overall increase in defense spending.[280]\n\n\nButtigieg has said that he believes the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks was justified[271] but supported the planned withdrawal of American troops from the region with a maintained intelligence presence.[281] He is a committed supporter of Israel,[282][283] favors a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict,[283][284] opposes proposals for Israel to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank,[283] and disapproves of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments in support of applying Israeli law in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.[285]\n\n\nIn 2008, Buttigieg wrote an op-ed in *The New York Times* calling on the United States to support the *de facto* independent Republic of Somaliland.[286]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Buttigieg said: \"We will remain open to working with a regime like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the American people. But we can no longer sell out our deepest values for the sake of fossil fuel access and lucrative business deals.\"[287] He supports ending U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.[288]\n\n\nButtigieg has condemned China for its mass detention of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.[289] He criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which critics say gave Turkey the green light to launch its military offensive against Syrian Kurds.[290]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg opposed Republican efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[120]\n\n\nIn 2018, Buttigieg said he favored Medicare for All.[291] During his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has promoted *Medicare for All Who Want It*, which includes a public option for health insurance.[292][293][294] He has spoken favorably of Maryland's all-payer rate setting.[295] Buttigieg has described Medicare for All Who Want It as inclusive, more efficient than the current system, and a possible precursor or \"glide path\" to single-payer health insurance.[295][294] He also favors a partial expansion of Medicare that would allow Americans ages 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare, and supports proposed legislation, the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, that would \"create a fund to guarantee up to 12 weeks of partial income for workers to care for newborn children or family members with serious illnesses.\"[296]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Buttigieg released a $300 billion plan to expand mental health care services and fight addiction.[297][260]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and has drawn attention to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies. He defended a resident of Granger, Indiana, who was deported after living in the U.S. for 17 years despite regularly checking in with ICE and applying for a green card.[298]\n\n\nButtigieg has said Trump has been reckless in sending American troops to the southern border, and that it is a measure of last resort.[299]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of St. James, which Buttigieg has attended\nButtigieg is a Christian,[300][301] and he has said his faith has had a strong influence in his life.[252][302][151] He was baptized in the Catholic Church as an infant and he attended Catholic schools.[301] While at the University of Oxford, Buttigieg began to attend Christ Church Cathedral and said he felt \"more-or-less Anglican\" by the time he returned to South Bend.[301] St. Augustine, James Martin, and Garry Wills are among his religious influences.[302] A member of the Episcopal Church, Buttigieg is a congregant at the Cathedral of St. James in downtown South Bend.[252]\n\n\nThrough his mother, he is the 4th Great-Grandson of 19th Century U.S. Congressman William Marshall Inge, who represented Tennessee's 10th District.\n\n\nBesides his native English, Buttigieg has some knowledge of Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Arabic, Dari Persian, and French.[303][33] Buttigieg plays guitar and piano,[304][305] and in 2013 performed with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra as a guest piano soloist with Ben Folds.[306][307] Buttigieg was a 2014 Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow.[308]\n\n\nButtigieg came out as gay in a June 2015 piece in the *South Bend Tribune*,[107] becoming Indiana's first openly gay elected executive.[309][310][311] He was the first elected official in Indiana to come out while in office[312] and the highest elected official in Indiana to come out.[311]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pete and Chasten Buttigieg in 2019\nButtigieg announced his engagement to Chasten Glezman, a junior high school teacher, in a December 14, 2017 Facebook post.[313][314] They had been dating since August 2015 after meeting on the dating app Hinge.[15][315] They were married on June 16, 2018, in a private ceremony at the Cathedral of St. James.[316][301] This made Buttigieg the first mayor of South Bend to get married while in office.[317] Chasten uses the surname Buttigieg.[318]\n\n\nButtigieg announced that he and his husband had become parents on August 17, 2021.[319][320] Buttigieg announced that they had adopted two newborn fraternal twins on September 4, 2021.[321][322][323]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Buttigieg established his permanent residence in Traverse City, Michigan, which is Chasten's hometown, and registered to vote in Michigan.[324]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg was a 2015 recipient of the Fenn Award, given by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in recognition of his work as mayor.[325] To mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in June 2019, *Queerty* named him one of its \"Pride50\" people—\"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\".[326] At the Golden Heart Awards, run by God's Love We Deliver, Buttigieg was awarded the \"Golden Heart Award for Outstanding Leadership and Public Service\" in October 2019.[327] Equality California, an LGBT-rights organization, gave Buttigieg and his husband Chasten their Equality Trailblazer Award in August 2020.[328] *Attitude*, a British gay lifestyle magazine, named Buttigieg their 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his groundbreaking run for the presidency.[329]\n\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\n* *Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future*.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 32nd mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012 to 2020, which earned him the nickname \"**Mayor Pete**\".\n\n\nButtigieg is a graduate of Harvard College and the University of Oxford, attending the latter on a Rhodes Scholarship. From 2009 to 2017, he was an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve, attaining the rank of lieutenant. He was mobilized and deployed to the War in Afghanistan for seven months in 2014. Before being elected as mayor of South Bend in 2011, Buttigieg worked on the political campaigns of Democrats Jill Long Thompson, Joe Donnelly, and John Kerry, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic nominee for Indiana state treasurer in 2010. While serving as South Bend's mayor, Buttigieg came out as gay in 2015. He married Chasten Glezman, a schoolteacher and writer, in June 2018. Buttigieg declined to seek a third term as mayor.\n\n\nButtigieg ran as a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, launching his campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election on April 14, 2019. He became one of the first openly gay men to launch a major party presidential campaign.[b] Despite initially low expectations, he gained significant momentum in mid-2019 when he participated in several town hall meetings and television debates. Buttigieg narrowly won the Iowa caucuses and placed a close second in the New Hampshire primary.[4][5][6] By winning Iowa, he became the first openly gay candidate to win a presidential primary or caucus. Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Joe Biden the following day.\n\n\nPresident-elect Biden named Buttigieg as his nominee for Secretary of Transportation in December 2020. His nomination was confirmed on February 2, 2021, by a vote of 86–13, making him the first openly gay Cabinet secretary in U.S. history.[c] Nominated at age 38, he is also the youngest Cabinet member in the Biden administration and the youngest person ever to serve as Secretary of Transportation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nPete Buttigieg, the only child of Jennifer Anne (Montgomery) and Joseph Anthony Buttigieg II, was born on January 19, 1982, in South Bend, Indiana. His mother uses the name Anne Montgomery.[8][9][10][11] His parents met and married while employed as faculty at New Mexico State University.[12] His father was born in Hamrun, Malta, and emigrated to the United States to pursue his doctorate.[13][14] Buttigieg's father embarked on a career as a professor of English at the University of Notre Dame near South Bend.[14][15] Buttigieg's mother also taught at the University of Notre Dame for 29 years.[16] His father was a translator and editor of the three-volume English edition of Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci's *Prison Notebooks* and influenced his pursuit of literature in college.[17]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg was valedictorian of the class of 2000 at St. Joseph High School in South Bend.[18][19] That year, he won first prize in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum's *Profiles in Courage* essay contest. He traveled to Boston to accept the award and met Caroline Kennedy and other members of President Kennedy's family. The subject of his winning essay was the integrity and political courage of then U.S. representative Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of only two independent politicians in Congress.[20][21][d] In 2000, Buttigieg was also chosen as one of two student delegates from Indiana to the United States Senate Youth Program,[23] an annual scholarship competition sponsored jointly by the U.S. Senate and the Hearst Foundations.[24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from St. Joseph High School, Buttigieg attended Harvard University, where he majored in history and literature.[25] He became president of the Student Advisory Committee of the Harvard Institute of Politics and worked on the institute's annual study of youth attitudes on politics.[26][27] He wrote his undergraduate thesis, titled *The Quiet American's Errand into the Wilderness*, on the influence of Puritanism on U.S. foreign policy as reflected in Graham Greene's novel *The Quiet American*.[28][29] He graduated *magna cum laude* from Harvard in 2004, and was elected a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[30][31]\n\n\nButtigieg was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford.[30][32] In 2007, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree with first-class honours in philosophy, politics, and economics after studying at Pembroke College, Oxford.[33][34][35][36] At Oxford, he was an editor of the *Oxford International Review*,[37] and was a co-founder[37] and member of the Democratic Renaissance Project, an informal debate and discussion group of approximately a dozen Oxford students.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Professional career[edit]\n\n\nBefore graduating from college, Buttigieg was an investigative intern at WMAQ-TV, Chicago's NBC News affiliate.[40] He also interned for Democrat Jill Long Thompson during her unsuccessful 2002 congressional bid.[41]\n\n\nAfter college, Buttigieg worked on John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign as a policy and research specialist for several months in Arizona and New Mexico.[42][43] From 2004 to 2005, Buttigieg was conference director of the Cohen Group.[44] In 2006, he lent assistance to Joe Donnelly's successful congressional campaign.[45]\n\n\nAfter earning his Oxford degree, in 2007 Buttigieg became a consultant at the Chicago office of McKinsey & Company,[46][47] where he worked on energy, retail, economic development, and logistics for three years.[48][49] His clients at McKinsey included the health insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, electronics retailer Best Buy, Canadian supermarket chain Loblaws, two nonprofit environmentalist groups, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Energy Foundation, and several U.S. government agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Energy Department, Defense Department, and Postal Service.[50][51] He took a leave of absence from McKinsey in 2008 to become research director for Jill Long Thompson's unsuccessful campaign for Indiana governor.[52][53][54] His work at McKinsey included trips to Iraq and Afghanistan, which he rarely discusses.[55] Buttigieg left McKinsey in 2010 in order to focus full-time on his campaign for Indiana state treasurer.[46]\n\n\nButtigieg has been involved with the Truman National Security Project since 2005 and serves as a fellow with expertise in Afghanistan and Pakistan.[48] He was named to the organization's board of advisors in 2014.[56][26]\n\n\n\n### Military service[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg joined the U.S. Navy Reserve through the direct commission officer (DCO) program and was sworn in as an ensign in naval intelligence in September 2009.[57] He took a seven-month leave during his mayoral term to deploy to Afghanistan in 2014.[58][59][60][61] While there, Buttigieg was part of a unit assigned to identify and disrupt terrorist finance networks. Part of this was done at Bagram Air Base, but he was also an armed driver for his commander on more than 100 trips into Kabul. Buttigieg has jokingly referred to his role as an armed driver as \"military Uber\", because he had to watch out for ambushes and explosive devices along the roads and ensure that the vehicle was guarded.[62] Also, while deployed in Afghanistan, Buttigieg was assigned to the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, a counterterrorism unit that targeted Taliban insurgency financing.[63][64] Buttigieg was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal,[65] and he left the U.S. Navy Reserve in 2017.[66][67][68]\n\n\n\n### Indiana state treasurer election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Indiana State Treasurer election\n\n![](image)Buttigieg campaign photo for Indiana State Treasurer in March 2010\nButtigieg was the Democratic nominee for state treasurer of Indiana in 2010. He received 37.5 percent of the vote, losing to Republican incumbent Richard Mourdock.[69][70] Much of Buttigieg's campaign had focused on criticizing Mourdock for investing state pension funds in Chrysler junk bonds, and for having subsequently filed a lawsuit against Chrysler's bankruptcy restructuring, which Buttigieg argued imperiled Chrysler jobs in the state of Indiana.[71][72][73]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of South Bend[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mayoralty of Pete Buttigieg\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\nShortly after losing the 2010 Indiana State Treasurer election, Buttigieg ran for the Democratic nomination for mayor of South Bend in 2011. In a PBS Michiana – WNIT broadcast, he expressed his desire to reinvigorate South Bend, especially with respect to job creation and education.[74] Buttigieg campaigned on other issues, such as pursuing international investment,[75] increasing presence of police and other safety professionals,[76] and improving city services.[77] Buttigieg won his primary election against four opponents on May 3, 2011,[78] receiving 7,663 votes.[78]\nButtigieg was elected mayor of South Bend in the November 2011 general election with 10,991 of the 14,883 votes cast, or 74 percent of all votes.[79] He defeated Republican nominee Norris W. Curry Jr. and Libertarian nominee Patrick M. Farrell.[80] Buttigieg took office in January 2012 at the age of 29, becoming the second-youngest mayor in South Bend history[e] and the youngest incumbent mayor, at the time, of a U.S. city with at least 100,000 residents.[79]\n\n\nBefore Buttigieg took office, Jiha'd Vasquez, a 16-year-old black boy, was found hanging from an electrical tower on April 14, 2011.[82][83] Vasquez's backpack, on the ground near his body, had several items missing, according to Vasquez's mother Stephanie Jones.[82] The coroner, Chuck Hurley, who had no medical experience, claimed Vasquez's death was a suicide; Buttigieg later appointed Hurley to serve as interim police chief.[82] Vasquez's body was cremated without an autopsy being conducted.[82] Jones attempted to get Buttigieg to investigate her son's death.[82] According to Jones, Buttigieg told her to call his office, but she never got a response.[82] Jones and South Bend NAACP legal redress chairman Tom Bush claimed the event was a cover-up, with Bush saying he suspected the Ku Klux Klan may be involved and hoped for a federal investigation, but did not expect it, saying \"the only reason this will get done is if you're on a microphone yelling and screaming.\"[84] When Buttigieg's presidential campaign was asked about the incident by a reporter in 2019, they did not give a response.[82] In 2019, Jones and St. Joseph County coroner Mike McGann argued that the case should be reopened; however, sheriff William Redman said he would not consider reopening the case unless further evidence came to light.[84]\n\n\nAfter a federal investigation ruled that South Bend police had illegally recorded telephone calls of several officers, Buttigieg demoted police chief Darryl Boykins in 2012.[85][f] Buttigieg also dismissed the department's communications director, who had discovered the recordings but continued to record the line at Boykins's command.[85] The police communications director alleged that the recordings captured four senior police officers making racist remarks and discussing illegal acts.[85][87]\n\n\nButtigieg has written that his \"first serious mistake as mayor\" came shortly after taking office in 2012, when he decided to ask for Boykins's resignation. Backed by supporters and legal counsel, Boykins requested reinstatement. When Buttigieg denied his request, Boykins, as the city's first African-American police chief, sued the city for racial discrimination,[88] arguing that the taping policy had existed under previous police chiefs, who were white.[89] Buttigieg settled the lawsuits brought by Boykins and the four officers out of court for over $800,000.[85][90] A federal judge ruled in 2015 that Boykins's recordings violated the Federal Wiretap Act.[87] Buttigieg came under pressure from political opponents to release the eight tapes, but he said that it was not possible to release seven of them, citing the Federal Wiretap Act.[85][87] It was unclear if releasing the eighth tape would violate any laws.[87] St. Joseph County Superior Court Judge Steve Hostetler heard a case for the release of five cassette tapes.[89] Judge Hostetler ruled that the cassette tapes must be released to the South Bend City Council in May 2021.[91]\n\n\nAs mayor, Buttigieg promoted a number of development and redevelopment projects.[92] Buttigieg was a leading figure behind the creation of a nightly laser-light display along downtown South Bend's St. Joseph River trail as public art. The project cost $700,000, which was raised from private funds.[93] The \"River Lights\" installation was unveiled in May 2015 as part of the city's 150th anniversary celebrations.[85] He also oversaw the city's launching of a 3-1-1 system in 2013.[94][95] Buttigieg's administration oversaw the sale of numerous city-owned properties.[96][97][98][99] One of Buttigieg's signature programs was the \"Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative\". Known locally as *1,000 Properties in 1,000 Days*, it was a project to repair or demolish blighted properties across South Bend.[100][101] The program reached its goal two months before its scheduled end date in November 2015.[102] By the thousandth day of the program, before Buttigieg's first term ended, nearly 40 percent of the targeted houses were repaired, and 679 were demolished or under contract for demolition.[103] Buttigieg took note of the fact that many homes within communities of color were the ones demolished, leading to early distrust between the city and these communities.[104]\n\n\nWhile mayor, Buttigieg served for seven months in Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, returning to the United States on September 23, 2014.[105] In his absence, Deputy Mayor Mark Neal, South Bend's city comptroller, served as executive from February 2014 until Buttigieg returned to his role as mayor in October 2014.[79][105][106]\n\n\nIn 2015, during the controversy over Indiana Senate Bill 101 – the original version of which was widely criticized for allowing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people – Buttigieg emerged as a leading opponent of the legislation. Amid his reelection campaign, he came out as gay and expressed his solidarity with the LGBTQ community.[107][108]\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg announced in 2014 that he would seek a second term in 2015.[109] He won the Democratic primary with approximately 78 percent of the vote, defeating Henry Davis Jr., the city councilman from the second district.[110] In November 2015, he was elected to his second term as mayor with over 80 percent of the vote, defeating Republican Kelly Jones by a margin of 8,515 to 2,074 votes.[111] After winning reelection, Buttigieg signed an executive order helping to establish a recognized city identification card in 2016.[112][113]\n\n\nTo improve South Bend's downtown area, Buttigieg proposed a Smart Streets urban development program in 2013.[85] In early 2015 – after traffic studies and public hearings – he secured a bond issue for the program backed by tax increment financing.[114][115] Smart Streets was a complete streets implementation program[116] aimed at improving economic development and urban vibrancy as well as road safety.[117] Elements of the project were finished in 2016,[85] and was officially completed in 2017.[117] The project was credited with spurring private development in the city.[115]\n\n\nIn a new phase of the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative, South Bend partnered with the Notre Dame Clinical Law Center to provide free legal assistance to qualifying applicants wishing to acquire vacant lots and, with local nonprofits, to repair or construct homes and provide low-income home ownership assistance using South Bend Housing and Urban Development funds.[118][119]\n\n\n\n![](image)Studebaker Building 84 in 2014\nThe City of South Bend partnered with the State of Indiana and private developers to break ground on a $165 million renovation of the former Studebaker complex in 2016, hoping that the redevelopment would facilitate industrial and housing units.[120] This development is in the Renaissance District, which includes nearby Ignition Park.[121][122] In 2017, it was announced that the long-abandoned Studebaker Building 84, also known as *Ivy Tower*, would have its exterior renovated with $3.5 million in Regional Cities funds from the State of Indiana and another $3.5 million from South Bend tax increment financing, with plans for the building and other structures in its complex to serve as a technology hub.[123] The website *Best Cities* later ranked South Bend number 39 on its 2020 list of the 100 best small cities in the United States, citing Buttigieg's efforts to revitalize the Studebaker factory and Downtown South Bend.[124]\n\n\nUnder Buttigieg, the city also began a smart sewer program, the first phase of which was finished in 2017 at a cost of $150 million.[121] The effort used federal funds[125] and by 2019 had reduced the combined sewer overflow by 75 percent.[121] The impetus for the effort was a fine that the EPA had levied against the city in 2011 for Clean Water Act violations.[121] In 2019, Buttigieg asked for the city to be released from an agreement with the EPA brokered under his mayoral predecessor Steve Luecke, in which South Bend had agreed to make hundreds of millions dollars in further improvements to its sewer system by 2031.[126]\n\n\nThe Common Council approved Buttigieg's request to enable his administration to develop a city climate plan in April 2019; Buttigieg signed a contract with the Chicago firm Delta Institute to help develop it.[127] In late November 2019, the city's Common Council voted 7–0 to approve the resultant Carbon Neutral 2050 plan, setting the goal of meeting the Paris Agreement's 26 percent emission reduction by 2025, and aiming for a further reductions of 45 percent by 2035.[128]\n\n\nSupporting private development in South Bend was another initiative Buttigieg continued during his second term.[129][130][131][132][133] By 2019, the city had seen $374 million in private investment for mixed-use developments since Buttigieg had taken office, by one estimate.[134][93] By another account, Downtown South Bend saw roughly $200 million in private investment during Buttigieg's tenure.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2018, Buttigieg proposed moving the city's South Shore Line station, from the airport to downtown\nWith respect to infrastructure, Buttigieg promoted the idea of moving the city's South Shore Line station from South Bend International Airport to the city's downtown in August 2018.[136] He made it a goal to have the city complete this project by 2025.[137] Also, South Bend launched Commuters Trust, a new transportation benefit program created in collaboration with local employers and transportation providers, including South Bend Transpo and Lyft, in 2019. The program was made possible by a $1 million three-year grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge.[138][139] Furthermore, under Buttigieg, South Bend invested $50 million in the city's parks, many of which had been neglected during the preceding decades.[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protestors marching in response to the death of Eric Logan\nAfter a white South Bend police officer shot and killed Eric Logan, an African-American man, in June 2019, Buttigieg was drawn from his presidential campaign to focus on the emerging public reaction. Police body cameras were not turned on during Logan's death.[140] Soon after Logan's death, Buttigieg presided over a town hall meeting attended by disaffected activists from the African-American community as well as relatives of the deceased man. The local police union accused Buttigieg of making decisions for political gain.[141][142] Buttigieg secured $180,000 in November 2019 to commission a review of South Bend's police department policies and practices, to be conducted by Chicago-based consulting firm 21CP Solutions.[143]\n\n\nMany African-Americans have accused Buttigieg of racism for his response to this and other incidents. Former South Bend councilman Henry Davis Jr. alleged that Buttigieg \"perpetuated and tolerated\" systemic racism in the city. Michael Harriot, senior writer at The Root, accused Buttigieg of \"racist paternalism\" for saying that children of color lack role models that promote the value of education. Many African-Americans also point to Buttigieg's firing of Darryl Boykins, South Bend's first black chief of police. Boykins claimed that Buttigieg used a scandal—involving secret tapes of white police officers making racist comments—as a pretext for firing him.[144][145][146]\n\n\n\n#### Increased national profile[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2016 U.S. Senate election in Indiana, he campaigned on behalf of Democratic Senate nominee Evan Bayh[147] and criticized Bayh's opponent, Todd Young, for having voiced support in 2010 for retaining the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, which Bayh had voted to repeal.[148] In the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Buttigieg endorsed Hillary Clinton.[149] He also endorsed Democratic nominee Lynn Coleman in that year's election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district, which included South Bend.[150]\n\n\nFrank Bruni of *The New York Times* published a 2016 column praising Buttigieg's work as mayor, with a headline asking if he might be \"the first gay president\".[151] Barack Obama cited him as one of the Democratic Party's talents in a November 2016 profile on the outgoing president conducted by *The New Yorker*.[152] As Buttigieg's national profile grew following his run in the 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, Buttigieg increased his out-of-city travel.[153] By early 2018, there was speculation that Buttigieg would run for either governor or president in 2020.[154][155]\n\n\nFor the 2018 midterms, Buttigieg founded the political action committee (PAC) Hitting Home PAC.[156] That October, Buttigieg personally endorsed 21 congressional candidates.[157] He also later endorsed Mel Hall, Democratic nominee in the 2018 election for Indiana's 2nd congressional district.[158] Buttigieg campaigned for Joe Donnelly's reelection campaign in the United States Senate election in Indiana.[159] Buttigieg campaigned for candidates in more than a dozen states, including early presidential primary states such as Iowa and South Carolina, a move indicating potential interest in running for president.[157] He officially announced his run on January 23, 2019.[160]\n\n\n\n#### Succession as mayor[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg announced that he would not seek a third term as mayor of South Bend in December 2018.[161] Buttigieg endorsed James Mueller in the 2019 South Bend mayoral election.[162][163] Mueller was a high-school classmate of Buttigieg's and his mayoral chief of staff, and later executive director of the South Bend Department of Community Investment.[162] Mueller's campaign promised to continue the progress that had been made under Buttigieg's mayoralty.[164] Buttigieg appeared in campaign advertisements for Mueller and donated to Mueller's campaign.[165] Mueller won the May 2019 Democratic primary with 37 percent of the vote in a crowded field.[166][162][167] In the November 2019 general election, Mueller defeated Republican nominee Sean M. Haas with 63 percent of the vote.[168][169] Mueller took office on New Year's Day 2020.[10]\n\n\n\n## DNC chairmanship campaign[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2017 Democratic National Committee chairmanship election\n\n![](image)Buttigieg campaigning for DNC chairman in 2017\nIn January 2017, Buttigieg announced his candidacy for chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in its 2017 chairmanship election.[170] He built a national profile as an emerging dark horse in the race for the chairmanship with the backing of former DNC chairman Howard Dean, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, Indiana senator Joe Donnelly, and North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp.[171][172] Buttigieg campaigned on the need for the Democratic Party to empower its millennial members.[171]\n\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Labor Tom Perez and U.S. representative Keith Ellison quickly emerged as the favored candidates of a majority of DNC members. Buttigieg withdrew from the race on the day of the election without endorsing a candidate, and Perez was elected chairman after two rounds of voting.[171]\n\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pete Buttigieg 2020 presidential campaign\n\nFurther information: 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n\n![](image)Buttigieg announcing his candidacy for president in 2020 on April 14, 2019\nOn January 23, 2019, Buttigieg announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to run for President of the United States in the upcoming 2020 election.[173] Buttigieg sought the Democratic Party nomination for president.[174][175] If he had been elected, he would have been the youngest and first openly gay American president.[173] Amid the start of Buttigieg's presidential effort, on February 12, 2019, he published his debut book, autobiography *Shortest Way Home*.[176] Two months later, Buttigieg officially launched his campaign on April 14, 2019, in South Bend.[177][178]\n\n\nButtigieg described himself as a progressive and a supporter of democratic capitalism.[179] Historian David Mislin identifies Buttigieg as a pragmatic progressive in the tradition of the Social Gospel movement once strong in the Midwest.[180] Buttigieg identifies regulatory capture as a significant problem in American society.[179]\n\n\nInitially regarded as a long-shot candidate,[181][182][183] Buttigieg rose into the top-tier of candidates in the primary by December 2019.[184] In early February 2020, Buttigieg led the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses results with 26.2 percent to Bernie Sanders' 26.1 percent, winning 14 delegates to Sanders's 12.[185][186] The LGBTQ Victory Fund, Buttigieg's first national endorsement,[g] noted the historical first of an openly gay candidate winning a state presidential primary.[187] Buttigieg finished second behind Sanders in the New Hampshire primary.[5] After placing a fourth in the South Carolina primary with 8.2 percent of the vote, behind Joe Biden (48.7 percent), Bernie Sanders (19.8 percent), and Tom Steyer (11.3 percent), Buttigieg dropped out of the race on March 1, 2020, and endorsed Biden.[188][189]\n\n\n\n### Post-presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Buttigieg launched Win The Era PAC, a new super PAC to raise money and distribute it to down-ballot Democrats.[190] The PAC focused on local elected positions, and its list of endorsements included candidates such as Jaime Harrison, Cal Cunningham, Gina Ortiz Jones, Christine Hunschofsky, and Levar Stoney.[191] On June 8, 2020, the University of Notre Dame announced that it had hired Buttigieg as a teacher and researcher for the 2020–21 academic year.[192] Also, in October 2020, Buttigieg released his second book, *Trust: America's Best Chance*.[193]\n\n\nButtigieg acted as a surrogate for Biden's campaign in the general election.[194][195] He delivered a speech on the closing night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention,[196] and also announced Indiana's votes during the convention's roll call.[197] On September 5, 2020, Buttigieg was announced to be a member of the advisory council of the Biden-Harris Transition Team, which was planning the presidential transition of Joe Biden.[198][199] Ahead of the vice presidential debate, Buttigieg played the role as a stand-in for Republican vice president Mike Pence in Democratic to prepare vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Buttigieg was selected to perform this role because of his experience working with Pence during their simultaneous tenures as mayor of South Bend and governor of Indiana, respectively.[200]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Kamala Harris swears in Buttigieg as Transportation secretary on February 3, 2021\nFollowing the end of his presidential campaign, Buttigieg was considered a possible Cabinet appointee in Joe Biden's administration.[201][202] After Biden was declared the winner of the election on November 7, 2020, Buttigieg was again mentioned as a possible nominee for Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador to China or Secretary of Transportation.[203] On December 15, 2020, Biden announced that he would nominate Buttigieg as his Secretary of Transportation.[204][205][206] The Senate Commerce Committee advanced Buttigieg's nomination to the full Senate with a vote of 21–3.[207] Buttigieg was confirmed on February 2, 2021, with a vote of 86–13;[208] and was sworn in the next morning.[209]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg visits Washington Union Station on his first full day as Secretary of Transportation\nAs Secretary of Transportation, Buttigieg has worked on re-organizing the department's internal policy structure, including carrying out a thorough review process of rules enacted under the Trump administration.[210][211] For example, Buttigieg reinstated an Obama-era pilot program which ensures local hiring for public works projects on May 19, 2021, with the goal of helping minorities and disadvantaged individuals. This program had been revoked in 2017 during the Trump administration, when the Department of Transportation returned to rules established during the Reagan administration, which banned geographic-based hiring preferences.[212]\n\n\nButtigieg addressed the African American Mayors Association in late February 2021 to discuss systemic racism. He argued that misguided investments in the federal transport and infrastructure policy had contributed to racial inequity.[213] In early March 2021, *Politico* noted that Buttigieg had mentioned racial equity in almost every interview he gave to the press as it related to his work at the department.[214] In late June 2022, Buttigieg launched a $1 billion Reconnecting Communities pilot program to establish racial equity in roads.[215] Using money from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the program aims to reconnect cities and neighborhoods divided by roads through projects such as rapid bus lines, pedestrian walkways, and planning studies.[216]\n\n\nEarly into his tenure, Buttigieg noted that the United States's actions surrounding road traffic safety is lacking and suggested improving the design of roads. Also, while acknowledging how the United States fell behind other developed countries with respect to bicycle and pedestrian safety, Buttigieg encouraged greater focus on human behavior in infrastructure policy.[217][218] Likewise, in March 2021, Buttigieg indicated he was open to tolls on Interstate 80, but not the tollage of bridges, suggesting \"big picture solutions\" instead, like a mileage tax.[219][220] However, the Biden administration did not include a gas tax or mileage tax in the infrastructure plan it released that month.[221]\n\n\nButtigieg informed Congress in late March 2021 that the Biden administration was planning to prioritize the construction of the Gateway Rail Tunnel Project due to its economic significance.[222] The progress of the project, which was stalled by President Trump,[223] was said to be moving faster, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Buttigieg announced the environmental impact assessment of the project—which was largely seen as a sign of major progress on the project.[224] Also, Buttigieg has served as a promoter of the American Jobs Plan[225] and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg and Barack Obama at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 9, 2021\nIn June 2021, the White House created a task force to address supply chain disruptions, with Buttigieg as one of its leaders.[227] By October 2021, global supply bottlenecks had resulted in record shortages of household goods for American consumers. Buttigieg cited high demand and the pandemic as some of the causes for the disruptions, while predicting that the disruptions would \"continue into next year\".[228][229]\n\n\nAfter the 2021 birth of his twins, Buttigieg took a parental leave. This became a point of prominent criticism and ridicule from conservative and Republican figures. Some political analysts have noted homophobic tones to the attacks on Buttigieg's decision to take a parental leave.[230] After conservatives criticized him for taking a paternity leave, Buttigieg declared that he would not apologize for \"taking care of my premature newborn infant twins. The work that we are doing is joyful, fulfilling, wonderful work.\"[231] According to his department, Buttigieg had been on paid leave since mid-August 2021, where for a month he was \"mostly offline except for major agency decisions and matters that could not be delegated\", and he \"has been ramping up activities since then\", making many media appearances in early October 2021.[232] The White House had approved Buttigieg's leave.[231]\n\n\nAfter passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, *Insider* called Buttigieg \"the most powerful transportation secretary ever\", as the department now has $210 billion of discretionary grants to award.[233]\n\n\nBy early 2023, Buttigieg faced criticisms regarding several instances of serious issues that had occurred in United States passenger aviation during his time as Secretary of Transportation.[234]\n\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg in East Palestine, Ohio on February 23, 2023\nOn February 3, 2023, a freight train carrying vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether derailed along the Norfolk Southern Railway in East Palestine, Ohio. Emergency crews conducted a controlled burn of the spill at the request of state officials, which released hydrogen chloride and phosgene into the air. As a result, residents within a 1 mi (1.6 km) radius were evacuated. Buttigieg tweeted on February 13 the Department would \"use all relevant authorities to ensure accountability and continue to support safety.\"[235] On February 23, 2023, NTSB released a preliminary report stating that the wheel bearings overheated, with temperatures as high as 253 °F (123 °C) above the ambient temperature.[236] In the weeks following the derailment, the Transportation Department, under Buttigieg, did not move to reinstate the 2015 rail safety rule aimed at expanding the use of better braking technology. Buttigieg's Transportation Department was contemplating stripping down brake safety rules even further.[237] Buttigieg has faced criticism from figures on different ends of the political spectrum for his response to the derailment, receiving criticism from Democrats such as Nina Turner and Ilhan Omar and Republicans such as J. D. Vance and Anna Paulina Luna.[238] Republican senator Marco Rubio called for Buttigieg to resign, and criticized him for not having yet visiting the disaster site at the time.[239] Former president Donald Trump also criticized Buttigieg for not having yet visited the site while conducting a visit of his own.[240] In March 2023, Buttigieg appeared on CNN, telling the cable news network that he had failed to anticipated the fallout from the derailment and erred in not visiting East Palestine sooner.[241][242]\n\n\nOn May 8, 2023, President Biden and Secretary Buttigieg announced an expansion of flightsright.gov, a website which informs airline customers of the compensation they are entitled to after flight cancellations or delays.\n[243]\nButtigieg supports The Junk Fee Prevention Act. If enacted on the federal level it would lower fees relating to spending money on some forms of entertainment, hotel rooms, airport related services, and travel.[244]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Pete Buttigieg\n\n### Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nDuring his 2020 campaign for the Democratic nomination, Buttigieg proposed spending $1 trillion on U.S. infrastructure projects over the next ten years, estimating that the plan would create at least six million jobs. The plan focused on green energy, protecting tap water from lead, fixing roads and bridges, improving public transportation, repairing schools, guaranteeing broadband internet access, and preparing communities for floods and other natural disasters.[245][246][247]\n\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports abortion rights[248][249] and the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother is in danger.[250] He favors amending civil rights legislation, including the Federal Equality Act so that LGBT Americans receive federal non-discrimination protections.[251]\n\n\nButtigieg supports expanding opportunities for national service, including a voluntary year of national service for those turning 18 years old.[252][253][254]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Buttigieg shared his \"Douglass Plan\", named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to address systemic racism in America.[255] The initiative would allocate $10 billion to African-American entrepreneurship over five years, grant $25 billion to historically black colleges, legalize marijuana, expunge drug convictions, halve the federal prison population, and propose a federal New Voting Rights Act designed to increase voting access.[256][255]\n\n\nButtigieg supports abolishing the death penalty,[257] moving toward reversing criminal sentences for minor drug-related offenses,[258] and eliminating incarceration for drug possession offenses.[259]\n\n\nIn 2019, Buttigieg called for the United States to decriminalize mental illness and addiction via initiatives such as re-entry programs.[260] Also, he aspired to decrease incarceration rates because of mental illnesses or substance use by 75 percent during his first term as President of the United States.[261][260]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg favors the abolition of the Electoral College[262] and has also called for restoring voting rights to felons who have completed their prison sentences.[258][263]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance reform[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports a constitutional amendment on campaign finance to reduce the undue influence of money in politics.[264] During his 2020 presidential run, in response to accusation of campaign finance concerns, Buttigieg's campaign told *Newsweek* that he did not accept contributions from individuals and organizations such as corporate political action committees.[265] In addition, Buttigieg's campaign emphasized that Buttigieg had included critical campaign finance reforms as part of his campaign platform, including pushing to overturn *Citizens United* and *Buckley v. Valeo*.[265]\n\n\n\n### Statehood advocacy[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports statehood for the District of Columbia, and said that he would support Puerto Rico statehood if desired by the Puerto Rican people.[262]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg at a town hall meeting in Des Moines on October 12, 2019, with supporters holding signs saying \"Climate is a Crisis\"\nDuring his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Buttigieg stated that, if elected, he would restore the United States' commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and double its pledge to the Green Climate Fund. He also supports the Green New Deal proposed by House Democrats,[266][267] solar panel subsidies, and a carbon tax and dividend policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[268][269]\n\n\n\n### Economic beliefs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg speaking at the 2019 Iowa Federation of Labor Convention\nButtigieg identifies as a democratic capitalist and has decried crony capitalism.[270] He has entertained the possibility of antitrust actions against large technology companies on the basis of privacy and data security concerns.[271] During the Democratic primary, he supported deficit and debt reduction, arguing that large debt makes it harder to invest in infrastructure, health and safety.[272]\n\n\n\n### Workers' rights[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, he released a plan to strengthen union bargaining power, to raise the minimum wage to $15, and to offer national paid family leave.[273]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg speaking to the Iowa State Education Association in 2020\nButtigieg's education plan includes a $700 billion investment in universal full-day child care and pre-kindergarten for all children from infancy to age five.[274] Buttigieg has also proposed tripling Title I funding for schools serving students predominately from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.[275] Other goals include doubling the amount of new teachers of color in the next 10 years, addressing school segregation with a $500 million fund, paying teachers more, expanding mental health services in schools, and creating more after-school programs and summer learning opportunities.[274]\n\n\nHis plan for debt-free college has called for expanding Pell Grants for low-income students, as well as other investments and reversing Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy.[276] Under Buttigieg's college plan, the bottom 80 percent of students with respect to income would have received free education, while the top 20 percent would have paid for at least some portion of their tuition.[277] Buttigieg has opposed free college tuition for all students because he has believed universally free tuition unfairly subsidizes higher-income families at the expense of lower-income individuals who do not attend college.[278] This position distinguished Buttigieg from his competitors in the 2020 presidential election.[278]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buttigieg speaking with VoteVets.org in 2019\nButtigieg called for modifying the structure of defense spending,[279] while suggesting that he might favor an overall increase in defense spending.[280]\n\n\nButtigieg has said that he believes the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks was justified[271] but supported the planned withdrawal of American troops from the region with a maintained intelligence presence.[281] He is a committed supporter of Israel,[282][283] favors a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict,[283][284] opposes proposals for Israel to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank,[283] and disapproves of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments in support of applying Israeli law in Jewish settlements in the West Bank.[285]\n\n\nIn 2008, Buttigieg wrote an op-ed in *The New York Times* calling on the United States to support the *de facto* independent Republic of Somaliland.[286]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Buttigieg said: \"We will remain open to working with a regime like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the benefit of the American people. But we can no longer sell out our deepest values for the sake of fossil fuel access and lucrative business deals.\"[287] He supports ending U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen.[288]\n\n\nButtigieg has condemned China for its mass detention of ethnic Uyghurs in Xinjiang.[289] He criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, which critics say gave Turkey the green light to launch its military offensive against Syrian Kurds.[290]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg opposed Republican efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[120]\n\n\nIn 2018, Buttigieg said he favored Medicare for All.[291] During his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has promoted *Medicare for All Who Want It*, which includes a public option for health insurance.[292][293][294] He has spoken favorably of Maryland's all-payer rate setting.[295] Buttigieg has described Medicare for All Who Want It as inclusive, more efficient than the current system, and a possible precursor or \"glide path\" to single-payer health insurance.[295][294] He also favors a partial expansion of Medicare that would allow Americans ages 50 to 64 to buy into Medicare, and supports proposed legislation, the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, that would \"create a fund to guarantee up to 12 weeks of partial income for workers to care for newborn children or family members with serious illnesses.\"[296]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Buttigieg released a $300 billion plan to expand mental health care services and fight addiction.[297][260]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg supports Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and has drawn attention to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies. He defended a resident of Granger, Indiana, who was deported after living in the U.S. for 17 years despite regularly checking in with ICE and applying for a green card.[298]\n\n\nButtigieg has said Trump has been reckless in sending American troops to the southern border, and that it is a measure of last resort.[299]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of St. James, which Buttigieg has attended\nButtigieg is a Christian,[300][301] and he has said his faith has had a strong influence in his life.[252][302][151] He was baptized in the Catholic Church as an infant and he attended Catholic schools.[301] While at the University of Oxford, Buttigieg began to attend Christ Church Cathedral and said he felt \"more-or-less Anglican\" by the time he returned to South Bend.[301] St. Augustine, James Martin, and Garry Wills are among his religious influences.[302] A member of the Episcopal Church, Buttigieg is a congregant at the Cathedral of St. James in downtown South Bend.[252]\n\n\nThrough his mother, he is the 4th Great-Grandson of 19th Century U.S. Congressman William Marshall Inge, who represented Tennessee's 10th District.\n\n\nBesides his native English, Buttigieg has some knowledge of Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, Maltese, Arabic, Dari Persian, and French.[303][33] Buttigieg plays guitar and piano,[304][305] and in 2013 performed with the South Bend Symphony Orchestra as a guest piano soloist with Ben Folds.[306][307] Buttigieg was a 2014 Aspen Institute Rodel Fellow.[308]\n\n\nButtigieg came out as gay in a June 2015 piece in the *South Bend Tribune*,[107] becoming Indiana's first openly gay elected executive.[309][310][311] He was the first elected official in Indiana to come out while in office[312] and the highest elected official in Indiana to come out.[311]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pete and Chasten Buttigieg in 2019\nButtigieg announced his engagement to Chasten Glezman, a junior high school teacher, in a December 14, 2017 Facebook post.[313][314] They had been dating since August 2015 after meeting on the dating app Hinge.[15][315] They were married on June 16, 2018, in a private ceremony at the Cathedral of St. James.[316][301] This made Buttigieg the first mayor of South Bend to get married while in office.[317] Chasten uses the surname Buttigieg.[318]\n\n\nButtigieg announced that he and his husband had become parents on August 17, 2021.[319][320] Buttigieg announced that they had adopted two newborn fraternal twins on September 4, 2021.[321][322][323]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Buttigieg established his permanent residence in Traverse City, Michigan, which is Chasten's hometown, and registered to vote in Michigan.[324]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nButtigieg was a 2015 recipient of the Fenn Award, given by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in recognition of his work as mayor.[325] To mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots in June 2019, *Queerty* named him one of its \"Pride50\" people—\"trailblazing individuals who actively ensure society remains moving towards equality, acceptance and dignity for all queer people\".[326] At the Golden Heart Awards, run by God's Love We Deliver, Buttigieg was awarded the \"Golden Heart Award for Outstanding Leadership and Public Service\" in October 2019.[327] Equality California, an LGBT-rights organization, gave Buttigieg and his husband Chasten their Equality Trailblazer Award in August 2020.[328] *Attitude*, a British gay lifestyle magazine, named Buttigieg their 2020 Person of the Year to recognize his groundbreaking run for the presidency.[329]\n\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\n* *Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future*.

Since 2021, she has served as the 16th United States secretary of energy. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the attorney general of Michigan from 1999 to 2003 and as the 47th governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011, as the first woman to hold both offices.\n\n\nBorn in Vancouver, British Columbia, Granholm moved to California at age four. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984 and a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1987. She then clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1991, and was appointed to the Wayne County Corporation Counsel in 1995.\n\n\nIn 1998, Granholm ran for attorney general of Michigan, defeating Republican nominee John Smietanka. She ran for governor of Michigan in 2002 and was elected the state's first female governor. She was re-elected in 2006.\n\n\nGranholm was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama before he assumed office in 2009.[1] After leaving public office, Granholm took a position at the UC Berkeley and, with her husband Daniel Mulhern, authored *A Governor's Story: The Fight for Jobs and America's Future*, released in 2011.[2] She became host of *The War Room with Jennifer Granholm*. In 2017, she was hired as a CNN political contributor.[3]\n\n\nAfter President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Granholm to head the United States Department of Energy in 2020,[4] she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2021.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGranholm was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Shirley Alfreda (née Dowden) and Victor Ivar Granholm,[6] both bank tellers.[7] Granholm's maternal grandparents came from Ireland and Newfoundland, respectively.[7] Her paternal grandfather was Hugo \"Anders\" Granholm, who immigrated to Penny, British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1920s from Robertsfors, Sweden, where his father was the mayor.[8] The former Minister for Enterprise and Energy and former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, Maud Olofsson, lives in Robertsfors, and when the two met in Sweden, the media revealed that Olofsson's husband is a relative of Granholm.[9] Her paternal grandmother was Judith Olivia Henriette (Solstad) Granholm, an emigrant from Gjerstad in Southern Norway. She came with the ship SS *Bergensfjord* from Oslo to Halifax, and from there she took the railway to Penny, British Columbia, where her uncles and several others had established a small logging village.[10]\n\n\nGranholm's family immigrated to California when she was four years old.[11] She grew up in Anaheim, San Jose, and San Carlos.[12] Granholm attended Ida Price Junior High and Del Mar High School before graduating from San Carlos High School in 1977[11] and won the Miss San Carlos beauty pageant.[12] As a young adult, she attempted to launch a Hollywood acting career but abandoned her efforts at age 21.[11] In 1978, she appeared on *The Dating Game*,[13] and held jobs as a tour guide at Universal Studios and in customer service at the *Los Angeles Times* and was the first female tour guide at Marine World Africa USA in Redwood City, piloting boats with 25 tourists aboard.[12]\n\n\nIn 1980, at age 21, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen,[14] and worked for John B. Anderson's campaign for president of the United States as an Independent in the 1980 election. She then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, the first person in her family to attend college.[7] She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1984 with a B.A. in political science and French.[7] During a year in France, she helped to smuggle clothes and medical supplies to Jewish people in the Soviet Union[7] and became involved in the Anti-Apartheid Movement.[7] She then earned a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard University, also with honors, in 1987.[7] At Harvard Law School, Granholm served as editor-in-chief of the *Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, Granholm clerked for Judge Damon Keith, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, from 1987 to 1988.[7] She also worked for the Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign.[7] After working as an attorney in the Wayne County executive office from 1989 to 1991,[7] Granholm became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1991.[7][15] She helped to prosecute drug dealers, gang members and child pornographers, sued the state and fought against credit card fraud.[7] Of the 154 people Granholm tried, 151 were convicted.[7] In 1995, she was appointed as Corporation Counsel for Wayne County, the youngest person to hold the position.[15] Granholm defended the county against lawsuits, sued the state over road taxes, and fought to uphold environmental laws.[7]\n\n\n\n## Michigan Attorney General (1999–2003)[edit]\n\n\n### 1998 election[edit]\n\n\nThirty-seven-year Democratic Attorney General Frank J. Kelley chose not to run for a 10th term in 1998 and Granholm entered the race to succeed him. Unopposed for the Democratic nomination, she faced Republican John Smietanka, the 1994 nominee and former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan, in the general election. The campaign began as a relatively friendly one,[16] with both agreeing that they wanted to expand the Internet Crimes Unit, start neighbourhood-based crime-fighting programmes and continue working as a consumer advocate, as Kelley had done.[16]\n\n\nHowever, the race turned bitter in mid-September, when Smietanka ran television ads that called Granholm an \"inexperienced\" and \"dangerous\" liberal.[15] He also tried to link Granholm to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Geoffrey Fieger's crime plan, which called for greater emphasis on rehabilitation for non-violent criminals and shortening their prison terms.[15] Granholm, who had disavowed Fieger's crime plan the day it was released, said the claim was \"a lie, just a lie\" and that as attorney general, \"you are the person who is to protect the consumer from deceitful ads.\"[15] Asked what separated her from Smietanka, Granholm replied, \"Besides honesty?\"[15] Kelley also came to Granholm's defence, starring in an advertisement where he called Smietanka's ads \"garbage\" and a \"con\" and accused him of running a \"dishonest campaign\".[15][17] For his part, Smietanka was angered by Democratic advertisements that referred to late child support payments he had made and claimed that he had lied about how much of his own money he donated to his campaign.[18]\n\n\nAfter a close race, with polls showing the two candidates with virtually identical votes,[15][16] Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%).[19] After Granholm was elected governor in 2002, arguments arose between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor John Engler about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force him out of the 1998 race in favour of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at the Republican convention. Engler countered that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.[20][21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nGranholm was sworn into office on January 1, 1999, becoming the first female attorney general of Michigan.[18] She served a single term, from 1999 to 2003. In office, she continued Kelley's work on protecting citizens and consumers' rights and established Michigan's first High Tech Crime Unit, appointing Terrence Berg as its first chief.[22]\n\n\nIn April 1999, Granholm announced a lawsuit against RVP Development, builders of the Arcadia Bluffs Golf Course, alleging that poor construction of the course had led to illegal discharges of sediment into Lake Michigan from erosion following heavy storms in 1998, which had \"turned a ravine into a ravaged gorge\".[23] Development company President Richard Postma refused to pay the $425,000 of state fines, saying he had made moves to stop the erosion and accused Granholm of trying to make him \"a poster child for her campaign of the future\". Granholm responded that his \"perception of the political landscape in Michigan is as poor as his ability to construct a golf landscape\".[24] After years of negotiations and legal wrangling,[25][26][27] the lawsuit was settled in August 2003, with RVP Development agreeing to pay a $125,000 fine.[28]\n\n\nDuring her tenure as Attorney General, Granholm became a harsh critic of the annual tradition at The University of Michigan called the Naked Mile. Through her efforts, the event was essentially cancelled by April 2000 never to emerge again.[29] In July 2000, Granholm's office settled with J.C. Penney after the retailer made numerous pricing and scanning errors in stores in Michigan. The issue came to the attention of the attorney general's office after a \"repeat and progressively worse error rate\" that saw 33% of items sold in December 1999 being sold for more at the register than they were listed for on the shelves. J.C. Penney paid a fine and agreed to designate \"pricing associates\" to monitor for errors in pricing.[30]\n\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Granholm directed state agencies to work with lawmakers in keeping the fight against terrorism within the powers of the state. She also imposed a regulation on gasoline dealers to keep them from raising prices dramatically, something which occurred sporadically across Michigan immediately following the attacks. In February 2002, Granholm announced that her office was joining with the AARP Michigan State Office to help consumers fight calls from telemarketers.[31]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Michigan (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n### 2002 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 Michigan gubernatorial election\n\nIn the 2002 election, incumbent Republican governor John Engler was term-limited and not able to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's lieutenant governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. Blanchard had been defeated for reelection by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic whip to run for governor, his House district having been redrawn to make it all but unwinnable for him.[32]\n\n\nGranholm, seen by many as a \"fresh face\" after the 12-year Engler administration, raised more money than Blanchard and Bonior and consistently led them in polls by large margins.[33] Her campaign led to increased turnout among women[34] and she comfortably won the Democratic primary with 499,129 votes (47.69%) to Bonior's 292,958 (27.99%) and Blanchard's 254,586 (24.32%).[35]\n\n\nGranholm was the heavy favorite in the general election, boasting strong support from working women, African-Americans and voters under 30 years of age.[36] She campaigned on her record on crime and was seen as more charismatic than Posthumus.[36] Despite the 2002 elections being a good year for Republicans nationwide, who gained control of the U.S. Senate and increased their hold on the U.S. House, Granholm defeated Posthumus by 1,633,796 votes (51.42%) to 1,506,104 (47.40%).[37]\n\n\n\n### First term (2003–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Left to right: Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Granholm and Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue.\nGranholm was sworn in as the 47th governor of the state of Michigan on January 1, 2003. Upon her inauguration, in addition to becoming the state's first female governor, she also became its third governor who was not a natural-born citizen of the United States and its fourth who was not born within the United States. The earlier two non-natural-born citizens were Fred M. Warner, who was born in England and was the 26th governor from 1905 to 1911; and John Swainson, who was also born in Canada and was the 42nd governor from 1961 to 1963. George W. Romney, who was born in Mexico and was the 27th governor from 1963 to 1969, was a natural-born citizen by virtue of his parents' U.S. citizenship at the time of his birth.\n\n\nGranholm emphasized Michigan's need to attract young people and businesses via the Cool Cities Initiative.[38][39] As governor, she was a member of the National Governors Association, chairing its Health and Human Services Committee and co‑chairing its Health Care Task Force. She is also a former chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. She lived in the official Michigan Governor's Residence, located near the Capitol Building.\n\n\nDuring Granholm's first year in office, she made a significant number of budget cuts to deal with a $1.7 billion deficit (about two percent of the annual state budget). She was upset by proposals to cut state funding to social welfare programs, such as homeless shelters and mental health agencies.[40]\n\n\nGranholm has been a proponent of education reform since the first year of her term. In her first State of the State Address in 2003, Granholm announced Project Great Start to focus on reforming education for children from birth to age five. Project Great Start has coordinated public and private efforts to encourage educating new parents and encouraging parents to read to their children.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Granholm addressing troops returning to Michigan following a tour in Iraq, December 2005\nGranholm emphasized post-secondary education for Michiganders following the decline in Michigan manufacturing jobs, many of which did not require a college degree. In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission's recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm's tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.[42]\n\n\nAt an awards ceremony on October 28, 2004, Granholm was inducted into the \"Michigan Women's Hall of Fame\". She has also been the recipient of the Michigan Jaycees 1999 \"Outstanding Young Michiganders\" and the YWCA \"Woman of the Year\" awards.\n\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election in Michigan, Granholm campaigned hard for Democratic nominee John Kerry after early polls showed President George W. Bush with a narrow lead. She cited the economy as the main concern for Michiganders, not the Iraq War or the War on Terror, which meant that with \"the deficit larger; the Dow dropping; unemployment claims up, hitting an all-time high; General Motors profits below expectations, with health claims crippling profits; flu vaccine in short supply; oil prices rising\" her state was badly hit.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2005, Michigan's Republican-dominated legislature refused to vote on Granholm's proposed state budget, citing concerns over cuts to state funding for higher education.[44] In the previous years of Granholm's term, many cuts to higher education had been demanded and voted in the legislature in order to balance the state budget. The year before, Republican leaders had called Granholm a \"do‑nothing governor\", claiming that she failed to lead, while Democrats accused legislative Republicans of being obstructionist. In January 2005, Granholm presented an early budget proposal, demanded immediate response from the Legislature, and held a press conference outlining the highlights of the proposed budget. After refusing to consider, debate, or vote on the proposed budget, Republicans stated they would prefer that the legislature have more involvement in the formation of the state budget.[45]\n\n\nMichigan's economy had been losing jobs since 2000, largely owing to the decline in the American manufacturing sector. Granholm supported diversification of Michigan's economy away from its historical reliance on automotive manufacturing. She pushed through a $2 billion 21st Century Jobs Fund to attract jobs to Michigan in the life sciences, alternative energy, advanced manufacturing, and homeland security sectors.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2006 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 Michigan gubernatorial election\n\nGranholm ran for a second term in the 2006 election. Her opponent was Republican businessman and politician Dick DeVos.[47]\n\n\nBoth the Granholm campaign and the Michigan Democratic Party put out television commercials produced by Joe Slade White focusing on her efforts to revive Michigan's economy and accusing DeVos of cutting Michigan jobs while he was head of what was then called Amway. Granholm won re-election, defeating DeVos. The election results were 56 percent for Granholm, 42 percent for DeVos, and a little over one percent for minor-party candidates Gregory Creswell, Douglas Campbell, and Bhagwan Dashairya.[47] Granholm's share of the vote was 4.9 percent higher than in her first gubernatorial election in 2002. Granholm's campaign was managed by Howard Edelson.[48]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2007–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Granholm at a campaign event in November 2006\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This biography of a living person **relies too much on references to primary sources**.

The partisan division of power in Michigan's state government led to a showdown between Granholm and lawmakers over the FY 2008 state budget that resulted in a four-hour shutdown of nonessential state services in the early morning of October 1, 2007, until a budget was passed and signed.[49] The budget cut services, froze state spending in areas such as the arts,[50] increased the state income tax, and created a new set of service taxes on a variety of businesses, e.g. ski lifts and interior design and landscaping companies, to address a state budget shortfall. As a result of the controversial budget, some taxpayer and business advocates called for a recall campaign against Granholm and lawmakers who voted for the tax increases.[51]\n\n\nThe budget crisis eventually led Standard & Poor's to downgrade Michigan's credit rating from AA to AA-. Additionally, the crisis contributed to sinking approval ratings for Granholm, which went from 43 percent in August 2007[52] to a low of 32 percent in December 2007. She had one of the lowest approval ratings for any governor in the United States.[53]\n\n\nIn 2007 Granholm proposed and signed into law the No Worker Left Behind Act to provide two years of free training or community college for unemployed and displaced workers.[54] Since its launch in August 2007, more than 130,000 people have enrolled in retraining.[55] The program caps tuition assistance at $5000 per year for two years, or $10,000 per person, and covers retraining in high-demand occupations and emerging industries.[56]\n\n\nThe Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth reported back in October 2009 that 62,206 people had enrolled and that of the 34,355 who had completed training, 72% had found work or retained their positions and a further 18,000 were still in long-term or short-term training.[57][58] 16% of all enrollees had withdrawn or failed to complete the training.[58] As of July 2010, more than two years after the program was launched, 65,536 people were in training or involved in on-the-job training.[55] Dropouts had been reduced to 13.1% of enrollments.[55]\n\n\nGranholm delivered her sixth State of the State address on January 29, 2008. The speech focused mainly on creating jobs in Michigan through bringing alternative energy companies to Michigan.[59] Through passing a renewable portfolio standard, which would require that ten percent of Michigan's energy would come from renewable sources by 2015 and twenty-five percent by 2025, Granholm expected the alternative energy industry to emerge in Michigan.[60] Since the passage of the standard, Mariah Power, Global Wind Systems, Cascade Swift Turbine, Great Lakes Turbine, and 38 other companies have announced new projects in Michigan.[61] The solar and wind power industries now provide more than ten thousand jobs in Michigan.[62][63]\n\n\nGranholm also called in the speech for an incentive package to offer tax breaks to filmmakers who shoot in Michigan and use local crews in production. A package of bills offering film industry incentives was approved by both houses of the Michigan legislature and signed into law by Granholm on April 7, 2008.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Granholm hosts a panel of advisers to Barack Obama's presidential campaign during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.\nPartly because of pressure from Granholm, Michigan's Democratic presidential primary was moved up to January 15, leading the Democratic National Committee to strip the Michigan Democratic Party of its delegates (Michigan historically had held its caucuses on February 9). Granholm has been named by some as a possible candidate for United States attorney general. She was the policy chair of the Democratic Governors Association.\n\n\nOn April 29, 2008, Granholm had emergency surgery to fix a health issue that stemmed from a 1993 accident. Because of the surgery, Granholm had to postpone a trip to Israel and Kuwait.[65] She finally made the journey in November 2008 and signed a water technology partnership agreement with the Israeli government. In addition, she delivered the keynote address at an automotive event organized by the Michigan Israel Business Bridge and the Israel Export Institute.[66]\n\n\nIn response to a May 14, 2008, resolution by the Detroit City Council that Granholm remove Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick from office because of eight (later ten) felony counts against him,[67] Granholm began an inquiry[68] that culminated in a removal hearing on September 3, 2008.[69] On September 3, Granholm outlined the legal basis for the hearings, arguments were made, and three witnesses were called.[70] On the morning of September 4, Kilpatrick agreed to two plea deals in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and no contest one count of assaulting and obstructing a police officer in two separate cases. Both deals required his resignation. When the hearing reconvened later that day, Granholm said the hearing would be adjourned until September 22 as a result of the plea deals, and if Kilpatrick's resignation became effective before then the hearing would be cancelled.[71]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Governor Granholm undertook the role of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in a series of practice debates with Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden.[72]\n\n\nWith the election of Barack Obama as president, Granholm joined his economic advisory team, having had extensive experience running the Michigan economy, and there was speculation that she might join the Obama administration.[73] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that President Obama was considering Granholm, among others, for possible appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Eventually Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor.[74]\n\n\nIn 2010, Granholm was barred from seeking re-election due to Michigan's term limits law.[75] Her governorship ended on January 1, 2011, when Republican Rick Snyder, who won the 2010 election, was sworn in.\n\n\n\n## Subsequent career[edit]\n\n\nGranholm is a distinguished adjunct professor of law and public policy at the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy and UC Berkeley School of Law.[76] In the Autumn of 2011, she taught a graduate course entitled \"Governing in Tough Times\". She is also a senior research fellow at the Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute (BECI).[77] As a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts' Clean Energy Program and founder of The American Jobs Project at UC Berkeley, Granholm spearheads a campaign for a national clean energy policy that promotes and funds American energy independence and home-grown manufacturing and innovation for wind, solar, and advanced battery industries across the United States.[78] She is a regular contributor to NBC's political talk show *Meet the Press*, has written on U.S. energy policy[79] and has co-authored a book with her husband, *A Governor's Story: The Fight For Jobs and America's Economic Future*, which was released in September 2011 and was about the lessons Michigan's experience can offer to America.\n\n\nGranholm served on the board of directors of the Dow Chemical Company from March to October 2011.[80][81][82] In May 2011, she joined the board of directors of Marinette Marine Corporation, a Wisconsin ship builder and Defense contractor.[83][84] Granholm is currently serving as the sponsor of USS *Marinette*, a warship under construction by the company.[85] In August 2013, she joined the board of Talmer Bancorp, a Michigan financial institution.[84][86] Granholm continued to serve on the Talmer board until the company was acquired by the Chemical Financial Corporation at the end of August 2016.[87] In August 2016, she joined the board of ChargePoint, a corporation which manages a network of electric vehicle charging stations.[84][88] In March 2017, Granholm also joined the board of Proterra, a manufacturer of electric buses and charging stations.[84][89]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Current TV announced that she would be joining its new political primetime lineup as host of the new program *The War Room with Jennifer Granholm*. In January 2013, she announced that she was leaving the network due to the sale to Al Jazeera.[90]\n\n\nIn October 2012, she became a \"household name\" after delivering what has been described as a \"hyperactive\"[91] and \"sharp-tongued\"[92] speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on September 6. Granholm's speech centered on the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010; specifically, President Obama's decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler, its beneficial effects on the U.S. economy, and Mitt Romney's opposition to the bailout.[93]\n\n\nIn January 2014, she was picked to co-chair Priorities USA Action opposite Jim Messina.[94] She has previously said Hillary Clinton \"is the strongest candidate out there should she decide to raise her hand\" in regard to the upcoming 2016 presidential election. Granholm previously supported Clinton over Barack Obama in the 2008 election campaign. She considered running for the United States Senate in 2014 to replace retiring Democrat Carl Levin, but decided against doing so.[95]\n\n\nIn August 2015, months after Hillary Clinton's campaign announcement for the 2016 presidential election, Granholm transitioned from Priorities USA Action to Correct the Record, another Clinton-aligned political committee whose classification allows Granholm to serve as a direct \"surrogate\" for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.[96] In August 2016, Granholm was named by Clinton to the team planning for her potential presidential transition.[97]\n\n\n\n### Speculation of a return to office[edit]\n\n\nGranholm was twice mentioned as a possible U.S. Secretary of Energy, first in December 2008 when President-elect Obama was assembling his first-term Cabinet[98] and again in December 2010, when it was rumoured that Secretary Steven Chu might resign.[99]\n\n\nGranholm was also twice considered by President Obama to be a potential Supreme Court candidate.[100][101][102][103][104][105] In May 2009, she was on the shortlist of candidates to replace the retiring Associate Justice David Souter.[106] She attended a CAFE standards meeting at the White House on May 19 and spoke with Obama, but officials would not comment on whether the two discussed a potential court appointment.[107] Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed by the Senate in August. After the retirement of Associate Justice John Paul Stevens in May 2010, Granholm was again spoken of as a potential candidate;[108] Obama chose Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August.\n\n\nIn March 2011, with Tim Kaine poised to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee to run for the U.S. Senate from Virginia in 2012, Granholm was mentioned as a potential successor. However, she made clear early on that she was not interested, which was reported to have \"stunned\" senior Democrats, who were \"surprised and disappointed\" that Granholm had taken herself out of the running. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was elected instead.[109]\n\n\nAfter President Obama was re-elected in 2012, Granholm was reportedly considered for a position in Obama's second-term Cabinet, specifically to succeed Chu as secretary of energy, Ray LaHood as U.S. secretary of transportation, Hilda Solis as U.S. secretary of labor or Eric Holder as U.S attorney general.[110][111][112][113][114] Granholm herself dampened such speculation, citing her sharp criticism of Republicans during the 2012 election and her time presenting on Current TV.[115]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Michigan's senior U.S. senator, Democrat Carl Levin, announced that he would not run for a seventh term in 2014. Granholm was mentioned as a candidate to succeed him,[116] but she announced shortly after that she would not run.[117] She endorsed U.S. Representative Gary Peters,[118] who defeated Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land in the general election.\n\n\nIn September 2014, when U.S Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, there was speculation that Granholm might be a potential candidate to succeed him.[119] Loretta Lynch was ultimately nominated and confirmed for the position.\n\n\nThere was speculation that Granholm's increased visibility from her senior role in the Clinton campaign indicated that she would be under consideration for a position in the U.S. Cabinet or Democratic National Committee leadership if Clinton had won the 2016 election.[120]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Energy (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Granholm sworn in as Secretary of Energy by Vice President Kamala Harris in February 2021\nThen-President-elect Joe Biden nominated Granholm to be the next secretary of energy. Granholm was seen as one of Biden’s least controversial nominees, winning support from unions, environmental groups, and some Republicans.[121] University of California, Berkeley professor of energy Daniel Kammen, who worked with Granholm at UC Berkeley, said she will be \"phenomenal for DOE\" because \"she understands the technology, she understands deployment and she knows how to run a big agency.\"[122] She appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on January 27, 2021, and the committee voted to advance her nomination in a 13–4 vote on February 3, 2021.[123] She was confirmed by the Senate 64–35 on February 25, 2021, and was sworn into office later that day by Vice President Kamala Harris.[124][125] She is the first secretary of energy born outside the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2021, she said President Joe Biden \"has a goal of getting to net zero carbon dioxide for this country by 2050. And that means that we have got to figure out ways to clean up our fossil fuel industry.\"[126] On May 19, 2022, the Department of Energy announced a $3.5 billion program funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create four large-scale regional direct air capture hubs each consisting of a network of carbon dioxide removal projects.[127][128]\n\n\nGranholm had a call with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud. They discussed closer cooperation in the energy field.[129] In late 2021, she blamed the OPEC oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. gas and petroleum industry for rising fuel prices in the United States.[130][131][132] When asked what her plans were to increase oil production in the United States, she laughingly replied: \"That is hilarious. Would that I had the magic wand on this.\"[133]\n\n\nGranholm signed a detailed ethics agreement for the top energy government job and has since then, violated certain provisions of the STOCK Act.[134]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Granholm cleared J. Robert Oppenheimer, American theoretical physicist, often credited as the \"father of the atomic bomb\" for his role in the Manhattan Project – the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons, of the 1954 revocation of his security clearance due to a \"flawed investigation\".[135][136]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWhile Granholm was at Harvard, she met fellow law student and Michigan native Daniel Mulhern, a theology graduate from Yale University.[7] They married in 1986 and they took each other's surname as their middle names.[7] They have three children.[7]\n\n\nOn October 21, 2010, Granholm was made a Commander of the Royal Order of the Polar Star, First Class, by the King of Sweden \"for her work in fostering relations between Michigan and Sweden to promote a clean energy economy.\"[137][138]\n\n\nGranholm is Roman Catholic. She converted to Catholicism while at Harvard Law School.[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2006 Michigan gubernatorial election\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jennifer Granholm (incumbent)**  | **2,142,513**  | **56.3**  | **+4.9**  |\n|  | Republican | Dick DeVos | 1,608,086\n | 42.3\n | −5.1\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Greg Creswell | 23,524\n | 0.6\n | *n/a* |\n|  | Green | Douglas Campbell | 20,009\n | 0.5\n | −0.3\n |\n|  | Constitution | Bhagwan Dashairya | 7,087\n | 0.2\n | −0.3\n |\n|  | Write-in | 37\n | 0.0\n | *n/a* |\n| Majority\n | 534,427\n | 14.0\n | +10\n |\n| Turnout | 3,801,256\n | 100\n | +19.6\n |\n|  | Democratic **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2002 Michigan gubernatorial election[141]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jennifer Granholm**  | **1,633,796**  | **51.42**  | **+13.64**  |\n|  | Republican | Dick Posthumus | 1,506,104\n | 47.40\n | −14.81\n |\n|  | Green | Douglas Campbell | 25,236\n | 0.79\n |  |\n|  | Constitution | Joseph Pilchak\n | 12,411\n | 0.3\n |  |\n|  | Write-in | 18\n | 0.00\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 127,692\n | 4.02\n |  |\n| Turnout | 3,177,565\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican |\n\n\n\n\n2002 Michigan gubernatorial election – Democratic primary\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jennifer Granholm**  | **499,129**  | **47.69**  |  |\n|  | Democratic | David E.

Since 2021, she has served as the 16th United States secretary of energy. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the attorney general of Michigan from 1999 to 2003 and as the 47th governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011, as the first woman to hold both offices.\n\n\nBorn in Vancouver, British Columbia, Granholm moved to California at age four. She obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984 and a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1987. She then clerked for Judge Damon Keith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1991, and was appointed to the Wayne County Corporation Counsel in 1995.\n\n\nIn 1998, Granholm ran for attorney general of Michigan, defeating Republican nominee John Smietanka. She ran for governor of Michigan in 2002 and was elected the state's first female governor. She was re-elected in 2006.\n\n\nGranholm was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama before he assumed office in 2009.[1] After leaving public office, Granholm took a position at the UC Berkeley and, with her husband Daniel Mulhern, authored *A Governor's Story: The Fight for Jobs and America's Future*, released in 2011.[2] She became host of *The War Room with Jennifer Granholm*. In 2017, she was hired as a CNN political contributor.[3]\n\n\nAfter President-elect Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Granholm to head the United States Department of Energy in 2020,[4] she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2021.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGranholm was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Shirley Alfreda (née Dowden) and Victor Ivar Granholm,[6] both bank tellers.[7] Granholm's maternal grandparents came from Ireland and Newfoundland, respectively.[7] Her paternal grandfather was Hugo \"Anders\" Granholm, who immigrated to Penny, British Columbia, Canada, in the late 1920s from Robertsfors, Sweden, where his father was the mayor.[8] The former Minister for Enterprise and Energy and former Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, Maud Olofsson, lives in Robertsfors, and when the two met in Sweden, the media revealed that Olofsson's husband is a relative of Granholm.[9] Her paternal grandmother was Judith Olivia Henriette (Solstad) Granholm, an emigrant from Gjerstad in Southern Norway. She came with the ship SS *Bergensfjord* from Oslo to Halifax, and from there she took the railway to Penny, British Columbia, where her uncles and several others had established a small logging village.[10]\n\n\nGranholm's family immigrated to California when she was four years old.[11] She grew up in Anaheim, San Jose, and San Carlos.[12] Granholm attended Ida Price Junior High and Del Mar High School before graduating from San Carlos High School in 1977[11] and won the Miss San Carlos beauty pageant.[12] As a young adult, she attempted to launch a Hollywood acting career but abandoned her efforts at age 21.[11] In 1978, she appeared on *The Dating Game*,[13] and held jobs as a tour guide at Universal Studios and in customer service at the *Los Angeles Times* and was the first female tour guide at Marine World Africa USA in Redwood City, piloting boats with 25 tourists aboard.[12]\n\n\nIn 1980, at age 21, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen,[14] and worked for John B. Anderson's campaign for president of the United States as an Independent in the 1980 election. She then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, the first person in her family to attend college.[7] She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1984 with a B.A. in political science and French.[7] During a year in France, she helped to smuggle clothes and medical supplies to Jewish people in the Soviet Union[7] and became involved in the Anti-Apartheid Movement.[7] She then earned a Juris Doctor degree at Harvard University, also with honors, in 1987.[7] At Harvard Law School, Granholm served as editor-in-chief of the *Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law School, Granholm clerked for Judge Damon Keith, a senior judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, from 1987 to 1988.[7] She also worked for the Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign.[7] After working as an attorney in the Wayne County executive office from 1989 to 1991,[7] Granholm became an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan in 1991.[7][15] She helped to prosecute drug dealers, gang members and child pornographers, sued the state and fought against credit card fraud.[7] Of the 154 people Granholm tried, 151 were convicted.[7] In 1995, she was appointed as Corporation Counsel for Wayne County, the youngest person to hold the position.[15] Granholm defended the county against lawsuits, sued the state over road taxes, and fought to uphold environmental laws.[7]\n\n\n\n## Michigan Attorney General (1999–2003)[edit]\n\n\n### 1998 election[edit]\n\n\nThirty-seven-year Democratic Attorney General Frank J. Kelley chose not to run for a 10th term in 1998 and Granholm entered the race to succeed him. Unopposed for the Democratic nomination, she faced Republican John Smietanka, the 1994 nominee and former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Michigan, in the general election. The campaign began as a relatively friendly one,[16] with both agreeing that they wanted to expand the Internet Crimes Unit, start neighbourhood-based crime-fighting programmes and continue working as a consumer advocate, as Kelley had done.[16]\n\n\nHowever, the race turned bitter in mid-September, when Smietanka ran television ads that called Granholm an \"inexperienced\" and \"dangerous\" liberal.[15] He also tried to link Granholm to Democratic gubernatorial nominee Geoffrey Fieger's crime plan, which called for greater emphasis on rehabilitation for non-violent criminals and shortening their prison terms.[15] Granholm, who had disavowed Fieger's crime plan the day it was released, said the claim was \"a lie, just a lie\" and that as attorney general, \"you are the person who is to protect the consumer from deceitful ads.\"[15] Asked what separated her from Smietanka, Granholm replied, \"Besides honesty?\"[15] Kelley also came to Granholm's defence, starring in an advertisement where he called Smietanka's ads \"garbage\" and a \"con\" and accused him of running a \"dishonest campaign\".[15][17] For his part, Smietanka was angered by Democratic advertisements that referred to late child support payments he had made and claimed that he had lied about how much of his own money he donated to his campaign.[18]\n\n\nAfter a close race, with polls showing the two candidates with virtually identical votes,[15][16] Granholm defeated Smietanka by 1,557,310 votes (52.09%) to 1,432,604 (47.91%).[19] After Granholm was elected governor in 2002, arguments arose between Smietanka and then-Republican Governor John Engler about who was most responsible for Granholm's meteoric rise in Michigan politics. Smietanka blamed Engler for trying to force him out of the 1998 race in favour of G. Scott Romney, for dredging up the issue of his missed child support payments and for not supporting him more fully after he defeated Romney at the Republican convention. Engler countered that Smietanka was a weak candidate who should have stepped aside for Romney, who would have beaten the inexperienced Granholm; she would then not have had a launch pad for her gubernatorial campaign in 2002.[20][21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nGranholm was sworn into office on January 1, 1999, becoming the first female attorney general of Michigan.[18] She served a single term, from 1999 to 2003. In office, she continued Kelley's work on protecting citizens and consumers' rights and established Michigan's first High Tech Crime Unit, appointing Terrence Berg as its first chief.[22]\n\n\nIn April 1999, Granholm announced a lawsuit against RVP Development, builders of the Arcadia Bluffs Golf Course, alleging that poor construction of the course had led to illegal discharges of sediment into Lake Michigan from erosion following heavy storms in 1998, which had \"turned a ravine into a ravaged gorge\".[23] Development company President Richard Postma refused to pay the $425,000 of state fines, saying he had made moves to stop the erosion and accused Granholm of trying to make him \"a poster child for her campaign of the future\". Granholm responded that his \"perception of the political landscape in Michigan is as poor as his ability to construct a golf landscape\".[24] After years of negotiations and legal wrangling,[25][26][27] the lawsuit was settled in August 2003, with RVP Development agreeing to pay a $125,000 fine.[28]\n\n\nDuring her tenure as Attorney General, Granholm became a harsh critic of the annual tradition at The University of Michigan called the Naked Mile. Through her efforts, the event was essentially cancelled by April 2000 never to emerge again.[29] In July 2000, Granholm's office settled with J.C. Penney after the retailer made numerous pricing and scanning errors in stores in Michigan. The issue came to the attention of the attorney general's office after a \"repeat and progressively worse error rate\" that saw 33% of items sold in December 1999 being sold for more at the register than they were listed for on the shelves. J.C. Penney paid a fine and agreed to designate \"pricing associates\" to monitor for errors in pricing.[30]\n\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Granholm directed state agencies to work with lawmakers in keeping the fight against terrorism within the powers of the state. She also imposed a regulation on gasoline dealers to keep them from raising prices dramatically, something which occurred sporadically across Michigan immediately following the attacks. In February 2002, Granholm announced that her office was joining with the AARP Michigan State Office to help consumers fight calls from telemarketers.[31]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Michigan (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n### 2002 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 Michigan gubernatorial election\n\nIn the 2002 election, incumbent Republican governor John Engler was term-limited and not able to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's lieutenant governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. Blanchard had been defeated for reelection by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic whip to run for governor, his House district having been redrawn to make it all but unwinnable for him.[32]\n\n\nGranholm, seen by many as a \"fresh face\" after the 12-year Engler administration, raised more money than Blanchard and Bonior and consistently led them in polls by large margins.[33] Her campaign led to increased turnout among women[34] and she comfortably won the Democratic primary with 499,129 votes (47.69%) to Bonior's 292,958 (27.99%) and Blanchard's 254,586 (24.32%).[35]\n\n\nGranholm was the heavy favorite in the general election, boasting strong support from working women, African-Americans and voters under 30 years of age.[36] She campaigned on her record on crime and was seen as more charismatic than Posthumus.[36] Despite the 2002 elections being a good year for Republicans nationwide, who gained control of the U.S. Senate and increased their hold on the U.S. House, Granholm defeated Posthumus by 1,633,796 votes (51.42%) to 1,506,104 (47.40%).[37]\n\n\n\n### First term (2003–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Left to right: Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour, Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Granholm and Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue.\nGranholm was sworn in as the 47th governor of the state of Michigan on January 1, 2003. Upon her inauguration, in addition to becoming the state's first female governor, she also became its third governor who was not a natural-born citizen of the United States and its fourth who was not born within the United States. The earlier two non-natural-born citizens were Fred M. Warner, who was born in England and was the 26th governor from 1905 to 1911; and John Swainson, who was also born in Canada and was the 42nd governor from 1961 to 1963. George W. Romney, who was born in Mexico and was the 27th governor from 1963 to 1969, was a natural-born citizen by virtue of his parents' U.S. citizenship at the time of his birth.\n\n\nGranholm emphasized Michigan's need to attract young people and businesses via the Cool Cities Initiative.[38][39] As governor, she was a member of the National Governors Association, chairing its Health and Human Services Committee and co‑chairing its Health Care Task Force. She is also a former chair of the Midwestern Governors Association. She lived in the official Michigan Governor's Residence, located near the Capitol Building.\n\n\nDuring Granholm's first year in office, she made a significant number of budget cuts to deal with a $1.7 billion deficit (about two percent of the annual state budget). She was upset by proposals to cut state funding to social welfare programs, such as homeless shelters and mental health agencies.[40]\n\n\nGranholm has been a proponent of education reform since the first year of her term. In her first State of the State Address in 2003, Granholm announced Project Great Start to focus on reforming education for children from birth to age five. Project Great Start has coordinated public and private efforts to encourage educating new parents and encouraging parents to read to their children.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Granholm addressing troops returning to Michigan following a tour in Iraq, December 2005\nGranholm emphasized post-secondary education for Michiganders following the decline in Michigan manufacturing jobs, many of which did not require a college degree. In 2004 she asked Lieutenant Governor John D. Cherry to lead the Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth to double the number of college graduates in Michigan. Many of the commission's recommendations were enacted into law during Granholm's tenure as governor, e.g. increasing high school graduation standards (The Michigan Merit Curriculum) so that every Michigan high school student takes a college preparatory curriculum, which includes four years of math and English/language arts and three years of science and social studies, beginning with students who entered high school in the fall of 2006.[42]\n\n\nAt an awards ceremony on October 28, 2004, Granholm was inducted into the \"Michigan Women's Hall of Fame\". She has also been the recipient of the Michigan Jaycees 1999 \"Outstanding Young Michiganders\" and the YWCA \"Woman of the Year\" awards.\n\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election in Michigan, Granholm campaigned hard for Democratic nominee John Kerry after early polls showed President George W. Bush with a narrow lead. She cited the economy as the main concern for Michiganders, not the Iraq War or the War on Terror, which meant that with \"the deficit larger; the Dow dropping; unemployment claims up, hitting an all-time high; General Motors profits below expectations, with health claims crippling profits; flu vaccine in short supply; oil prices rising\" her state was badly hit.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2005, Michigan's Republican-dominated legislature refused to vote on Granholm's proposed state budget, citing concerns over cuts to state funding for higher education.[44] In the previous years of Granholm's term, many cuts to higher education had been demanded and voted in the legislature in order to balance the state budget. The year before, Republican leaders had called Granholm a \"do‑nothing governor\", claiming that she failed to lead, while Democrats accused legislative Republicans of being obstructionist. In January 2005, Granholm presented an early budget proposal, demanded immediate response from the Legislature, and held a press conference outlining the highlights of the proposed budget. After refusing to consider, debate, or vote on the proposed budget, Republicans stated they would prefer that the legislature have more involvement in the formation of the state budget.[45]\n\n\nMichigan's economy had been losing jobs since 2000, largely owing to the decline in the American manufacturing sector. Granholm supported diversification of Michigan's economy away from its historical reliance on automotive manufacturing. She pushed through a $2 billion 21st Century Jobs Fund to attract jobs to Michigan in the life sciences, alternative energy, advanced manufacturing, and homeland security sectors.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2006 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 Michigan gubernatorial election\n\nGranholm ran for a second term in the 2006 election. Her opponent was Republican businessman and politician Dick DeVos.[47]\n\n\nBoth the Granholm campaign and the Michigan Democratic Party put out television commercials produced by Joe Slade White focusing on her efforts to revive Michigan's economy and accusing DeVos of cutting Michigan jobs while he was head of what was then called Amway. Granholm won re-election, defeating DeVos. The election results were 56 percent for Granholm, 42 percent for DeVos, and a little over one percent for minor-party candidates Gregory Creswell, Douglas Campbell, and Bhagwan Dashairya.[47] Granholm's share of the vote was 4.9 percent higher than in her first gubernatorial election in 2002. Granholm's campaign was managed by Howard Edelson.[48]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2007–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Granholm at a campaign event in November 2006\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This biography of a living person **relies too much on references to primary sources**.

The partisan division of power in Michigan's state government led to a showdown between Granholm and lawmakers over the FY 2008 state budget that resulted in a four-hour shutdown of nonessential state services in the early morning of October 1, 2007, until a budget was passed and signed.[49] The budget cut services, froze state spending in areas such as the arts,[50] increased the state income tax, and created a new set of service taxes on a variety of businesses, e.g. ski lifts and interior design and landscaping companies, to address a state budget shortfall. As a result of the controversial budget, some taxpayer and business advocates called for a recall campaign against Granholm and lawmakers who voted for the tax increases.[51]\n\n\nThe budget crisis eventually led Standard & Poor's to downgrade Michigan's credit rating from AA to AA-. Additionally, the crisis contributed to sinking approval ratings for Granholm, which went from 43 percent in August 2007[52] to a low of 32 percent in December 2007. She had one of the lowest approval ratings for any governor in the United States.[53]\n\n\nIn 2007 Granholm proposed and signed into law the No Worker Left Behind Act to provide two years of free training or community college for unemployed and displaced workers.[54] Since its launch in August 2007, more than 130,000 people have enrolled in retraining.[55] The program caps tuition assistance at $5000 per year for two years, or $10,000 per person, and covers retraining in high-demand occupations and emerging industries.[56]\n\n\nThe Department of Energy, Labor, and Economic Growth reported back in October 2009 that 62,206 people had enrolled and that of the 34,355 who had completed training, 72% had found work or retained their positions and a further 18,000 were still in long-term or short-term training.[57][58] 16% of all enrollees had withdrawn or failed to complete the training.[58] As of July 2010, more than two years after the program was launched, 65,536 people were in training or involved in on-the-job training.[55] Dropouts had been reduced to 13.1% of enrollments.[55]\n\n\nGranholm delivered her sixth State of the State address on January 29, 2008. The speech focused mainly on creating jobs in Michigan through bringing alternative energy companies to Michigan.[59] Through passing a renewable portfolio standard, which would require that ten percent of Michigan's energy would come from renewable sources by 2015 and twenty-five percent by 2025, Granholm expected the alternative energy industry to emerge in Michigan.[60] Since the passage of the standard, Mariah Power, Global Wind Systems, Cascade Swift Turbine, Great Lakes Turbine, and 38 other companies have announced new projects in Michigan.[61] The solar and wind power industries now provide more than ten thousand jobs in Michigan.[62][63]\n\n\nGranholm also called in the speech for an incentive package to offer tax breaks to filmmakers who shoot in Michigan and use local crews in production. A package of bills offering film industry incentives was approved by both houses of the Michigan legislature and signed into law by Granholm on April 7, 2008.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Granholm hosts a panel of advisers to Barack Obama's presidential campaign during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.\nPartly because of pressure from Granholm, Michigan's Democratic presidential primary was moved up to January 15, leading the Democratic National Committee to strip the Michigan Democratic Party of its delegates (Michigan historically had held its caucuses on February 9). Granholm has been named by some as a possible candidate for United States attorney general. She was the policy chair of the Democratic Governors Association.\n\n\nOn April 29, 2008, Granholm had emergency surgery to fix a health issue that stemmed from a 1993 accident. Because of the surgery, Granholm had to postpone a trip to Israel and Kuwait.[65] She finally made the journey in November 2008 and signed a water technology partnership agreement with the Israeli government. In addition, she delivered the keynote address at an automotive event organized by the Michigan Israel Business Bridge and the Israel Export Institute.[66]\n\n\nIn response to a May 14, 2008, resolution by the Detroit City Council that Granholm remove Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick from office because of eight (later ten) felony counts against him,[67] Granholm began an inquiry[68] that culminated in a removal hearing on September 3, 2008.[69] On September 3, Granholm outlined the legal basis for the hearings, arguments were made, and three witnesses were called.[70] On the morning of September 4, Kilpatrick agreed to two plea deals in which he pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and no contest one count of assaulting and obstructing a police officer in two separate cases. Both deals required his resignation. When the hearing reconvened later that day, Granholm said the hearing would be adjourned until September 22 as a result of the plea deals, and if Kilpatrick's resignation became effective before then the hearing would be cancelled.[71]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Governor Granholm undertook the role of Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in a series of practice debates with Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden.[72]\n\n\nWith the election of Barack Obama as president, Granholm joined his economic advisory team, having had extensive experience running the Michigan economy, and there was speculation that she might join the Obama administration.[73] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that President Obama was considering Granholm, among others, for possible appointment to the United States Supreme Court. Eventually Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor.[74]\n\n\nIn 2010, Granholm was barred from seeking re-election due to Michigan's term limits law.[75] Her governorship ended on January 1, 2011, when Republican Rick Snyder, who won the 2010 election, was sworn in.\n\n\n\n## Subsequent career[edit]\n\n\nGranholm is a distinguished adjunct professor of law and public policy at the UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy and UC Berkeley School of Law.[76] In the Autumn of 2011, she taught a graduate course entitled \"Governing in Tough Times\". She is also a senior research fellow at the Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute (BECI).[77] As a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts' Clean Energy Program and founder of The American Jobs Project at UC Berkeley, Granholm spearheads a campaign for a national clean energy policy that promotes and funds American energy independence and home-grown manufacturing and innovation for wind, solar, and advanced battery industries across the United States.[78] She is a regular contributor to NBC's political talk show *Meet the Press*, has written on U.S. energy policy[79] and has co-authored a book with her husband, *A Governor's Story: The Fight For Jobs and America's Economic Future*, which was released in September 2011 and was about the lessons Michigan's experience can offer to America.\n\n\nGranholm served on the board of directors of the Dow Chemical Company from March to October 2011.[80][81][82] In May 2011, she joined the board of directors of Marinette Marine Corporation, a Wisconsin ship builder and Defense contractor.[83][84] Granholm is currently serving as the sponsor of USS *Marinette*, a warship under construction by the company.[85] In August 2013, she joined the board of Talmer Bancorp, a Michigan financial institution.[84][86] Granholm continued to serve on the Talmer board until the company was acquired by the Chemical Financial Corporation at the end of August 2016.[87] In August 2016, she joined the board of ChargePoint, a corporation which manages a network of electric vehicle charging stations.[84][88] In March 2017, Granholm also joined the board of Proterra, a manufacturer of electric buses and charging stations.[84][89]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Current TV announced that she would be joining its new political primetime lineup as host of the new program *The War Room with Jennifer Granholm*. In January 2013, she announced that she was leaving the network due to the sale to Al Jazeera.[90]\n\n\nIn October 2012, she became a \"household name\" after delivering what has been described as a \"hyperactive\"[91] and \"sharp-tongued\"[92] speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on September 6. Granholm's speech centered on the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010; specifically, President Obama's decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler, its beneficial effects on the U.S. economy, and Mitt Romney's opposition to the bailout.[93]\n\n\nIn January 2014, she was picked to co-chair Priorities USA Action opposite Jim Messina.[94] She has previously said Hillary Clinton \"is the strongest candidate out there should she decide to raise her hand\" in regard to the upcoming 2016 presidential election. Granholm previously supported Clinton over Barack Obama in the 2008 election campaign. She considered running for the United States Senate in 2014 to replace retiring Democrat Carl Levin, but decided against doing so.[95]\n\n\nIn August 2015, months after Hillary Clinton's campaign announcement for the 2016 presidential election, Granholm transitioned from Priorities USA Action to Correct the Record, another Clinton-aligned political committee whose classification allows Granholm to serve as a direct \"surrogate\" for Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.[96] In August 2016, Granholm was named by Clinton to the team planning for her potential presidential transition.[97]\n\n\n\n### Speculation of a return to office[edit]\n\n\nGranholm was twice mentioned as a possible U.S. Secretary of Energy, first in December 2008 when President-elect Obama was assembling his first-term Cabinet[98] and again in December 2010, when it was rumoured that Secretary Steven Chu might resign.[99]\n\n\nGranholm was also twice considered by President Obama to be a potential Supreme Court candidate.[100][101][102][103][104][105] In May 2009, she was on the shortlist of candidates to replace the retiring Associate Justice David Souter.[106] She attended a CAFE standards meeting at the White House on May 19 and spoke with Obama, but officials would not comment on whether the two discussed a potential court appointment.[107] Obama chose Sonia Sotomayor, who was confirmed by the Senate in August. After the retirement of Associate Justice John Paul Stevens in May 2010, Granholm was again spoken of as a potential candidate;[108] Obama chose Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August.\n\n\nIn March 2011, with Tim Kaine poised to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee to run for the U.S. Senate from Virginia in 2012, Granholm was mentioned as a potential successor. However, she made clear early on that she was not interested, which was reported to have \"stunned\" senior Democrats, who were \"surprised and disappointed\" that Granholm had taken herself out of the running. U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida was elected instead.[109]\n\n\nAfter President Obama was re-elected in 2012, Granholm was reportedly considered for a position in Obama's second-term Cabinet, specifically to succeed Chu as secretary of energy, Ray LaHood as U.S. secretary of transportation, Hilda Solis as U.S. secretary of labor or Eric Holder as U.S attorney general.[110][111][112][113][114] Granholm herself dampened such speculation, citing her sharp criticism of Republicans during the 2012 election and her time presenting on Current TV.[115]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Michigan's senior U.S. senator, Democrat Carl Levin, announced that he would not run for a seventh term in 2014. Granholm was mentioned as a candidate to succeed him,[116] but she announced shortly after that she would not run.[117] She endorsed U.S. Representative Gary Peters,[118] who defeated Republican nominee Terri Lynn Land in the general election.\n\n\nIn September 2014, when U.S Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, there was speculation that Granholm might be a potential candidate to succeed him.[119] Loretta Lynch was ultimately nominated and confirmed for the position.\n\n\nThere was speculation that Granholm's increased visibility from her senior role in the Clinton campaign indicated that she would be under consideration for a position in the U.S. Cabinet or Democratic National Committee leadership if Clinton had won the 2016 election.[120]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Energy (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Granholm sworn in as Secretary of Energy by Vice President Kamala Harris in February 2021\nThen-President-elect Joe Biden nominated Granholm to be the next secretary of energy. Granholm was seen as one of Biden’s least controversial nominees, winning support from unions, environmental groups, and some Republicans.[121] University of California, Berkeley professor of energy Daniel Kammen, who worked with Granholm at UC Berkeley, said she will be \"phenomenal for DOE\" because \"she understands the technology, she understands deployment and she knows how to run a big agency.\"[122] She appeared before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on January 27, 2021, and the committee voted to advance her nomination in a 13–4 vote on February 3, 2021.[123] She was confirmed by the Senate 64–35 on February 25, 2021, and was sworn into office later that day by Vice President Kamala Harris.[124][125] She is the first secretary of energy born outside the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2021, she said President Joe Biden \"has a goal of getting to net zero carbon dioxide for this country by 2050. And that means that we have got to figure out ways to clean up our fossil fuel industry.\"[126] On May 19, 2022, the Department of Energy announced a $3.5 billion program funded under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to create four large-scale regional direct air capture hubs each consisting of a network of carbon dioxide removal projects.[127][128]\n\n\nGranholm had a call with Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud. They discussed closer cooperation in the energy field.[129] In late 2021, she blamed the OPEC oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia and the U.S. gas and petroleum industry for rising fuel prices in the United States.[130][131][132] When asked what her plans were to increase oil production in the United States, she laughingly replied: \"That is hilarious. Would that I had the magic wand on this.\"[133]\n\n\nGranholm signed a detailed ethics agreement for the top energy government job and has since then, violated certain provisions of the STOCK Act.[134]\n\n\nOn December 16, 2022, Granholm cleared J.

A member of the Democratic Party, he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 64–33 on March 1, 2021.[1] Cardona previously served as commissioner of the Connecticut State Department of Education from 2019 to 2021.\n\n\nA native of Meriden, Connecticut, Cardona began his career as a fourth-grade teacher at Israel Putnam Elementary School in Meriden. In 2003, at the age of twenty-seven, he was named principal of Meriden's Hanover School, making him the youngest principal in the state.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCardona was born on July 11, 1975, in Meriden, Connecticut, to Puerto Rican parents.[4][5] Cardona grew up speaking Spanish as his first language and started to learn English when entering kindergarten.[6][7] His father is a retired police officer in Meriden.[8] Cardona was raised in a housing project in Meriden and graduated from the H.C. Wilcox Technical High School, where he was a part of the automotive studies program.[9][10][11]\n\n\nCardona earned a bachelor of science degree in education from Central Connecticut State University in 1997. He obtained a master of science in bilingual and bicultural education at University of Connecticut (UConn) in 2001. In 2004, he completed a professional sixth year certification at UConn where he earned a doctor of education in 2011.[12][13]\n\n\nCardona's dissertation, titled *Sharpening the Focus of Political Will to Address Achievement Disparities*, studied the gaps between English-language learners and their classmates.[13][6] His doctoral major advisor was Barry G. Sheckley and his associate advisor was Casey D. Cobb.[13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nCardona began his career as a fourth-grade teacher at Israel Putnam Elementary School in Meriden, Connecticut. In 2003, at Hanover Elementary School, he was promoted and made the youngest principal in the state's history for ten years. From 2015 to 2019, Cardona served as assistant superintendent for teaching and learning in his home town.[14][15]\n\n\nCardona was also an adjunct professor of education in the University of Connecticut's Department of Educational Leadership.[16] During his career, he has focused on closing gaps between English-language learners and their peers.[6]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Governor Ned Lamont appointed Cardona as commissioner of education; Cardona was the first Latino to hold the position.[12][11] During his tenure, Cardona helped oversee state schools' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where he expressed concerns over the long-term mental health impacts of remote education on students.[8]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Education[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Cardona emerged as a candidate for United States secretary of education in Joe Biden's cabinet. Biden began to lean toward Cardona over two other \"high-profile\" teachers' union leaders, Lily Eskelsen García and Randi Weingarten. By choosing Cardona over the two, Biden \"appeared to have sidestepped any sibling rivalry between the NEA and AFT.\"[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardona talks with reporters during a press briefing on August 5, 2021, at the White House.\nCardona was brought to the attention of Biden by Linda Darling-Hammond, the leader of the transition's education secretary search efforts, a role she also filled for Barack Obama in 2008. Darling-Hammond and Cardona had worked together on numerous projects.[11] *Politico* noted that \"Hispanic lawmakers are stressing in particular the need for a Latina to join the administration.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCardona appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on February 3, 2021.[20] On February 25, his nomination was advanced by the Senate on a cloture vote of 66–32.[21] Cardona was confirmed on March 1, 2021 by a 64–33 vote.\nCardona took his oath of office on March 1, 2021 and was ceremonially sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 2, 2021.[22]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cardona solicited a letter from the National School Boards Association to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for federal assistance with what the letter called a \"growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation.\"[23] The letter cited examples in several states and listed federal statutes under which assistance could be provided, including \"the PATRIOT Act in regards to domestic terrorism.\" Several Republican elected officials criticized the letter's reference to domestic terrorism and called for Cardona to resign.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Cardona married Marissa Pérez, a family-school liaison.[25] Pérez was named Miss Connecticut in 2001 and Miss Connecticut Teen USA in 1996.[26][25] Cardona and his wife have two children: a son, Miguel, Jr., and a daughter, Celine.[12] Cardona is Catholic.[27]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"On the Nomination (Confirmation: Miguel A.

From 2015 to 2019, Cardona served as assistant superintendent for teaching and learning in his home town.[14][15]\n\n\nCardona was also an adjunct professor of education in the University of Connecticut's Department of Educational Leadership.[16] During his career, he has focused on closing gaps between English-language learners and their peers.[6]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Governor Ned Lamont appointed Cardona as commissioner of education; Cardona was the first Latino to hold the position.[12][11] During his tenure, Cardona helped oversee state schools' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where he expressed concerns over the long-term mental health impacts of remote education on students.[8]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Education[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Cardona emerged as a candidate for United States secretary of education in Joe Biden's cabinet. Biden began to lean toward Cardona over two other \"high-profile\" teachers' union leaders, Lily Eskelsen García and Randi Weingarten. By choosing Cardona over the two, Biden \"appeared to have sidestepped any sibling rivalry between the NEA and AFT.\"[17][18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardona talks with reporters during a press briefing on August 5, 2021, at the White House.\nCardona was brought to the attention of Biden by Linda Darling-Hammond, the leader of the transition's education secretary search efforts, a role she also filled for Barack Obama in 2008. Darling-Hammond and Cardona had worked together on numerous projects.[11] *Politico* noted that \"Hispanic lawmakers are stressing in particular the need for a Latina to join the administration.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCardona appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on February 3, 2021.[20] On February 25, his nomination was advanced by the Senate on a cloture vote of 66–32.[21] Cardona was confirmed on March 1, 2021 by a 64–33 vote.\nCardona took his oath of office on March 1, 2021 and was ceremonially sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 2, 2021.[22]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cardona solicited a letter from the National School Boards Association to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for federal assistance with what the letter called a \"growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation.\"[23] The letter cited examples in several states and listed federal statutes under which assistance could be provided, including \"the PATRIOT Act in regards to domestic terrorism.\" Several Republican elected officials criticized the letter's reference to domestic terrorism and called for Cardona to resign.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Cardona married Marissa Pérez, a family-school liaison.[25] Pérez was named Miss Connecticut in 2001 and Miss Connecticut Teen USA in 1996.[26][25] Cardona and his wife have two children: a son, Miguel, Jr., and a daughter, Celine.[12] Cardona is Catholic.[27]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"On the Nomination (Confirmation: Miguel A.

He then served as White House Chief of Staff for the full second term of President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2017.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcDonough was born on December 2, 1969, in Stillwater, Minnesota.[3] He was one of 11 children in a devout Irish Catholic family, his grandparents having emigrated from Connemara in the Gaeltacht.[4][5]\n\n\nMcDonough graduated from Stillwater Area High School in 1988,[6] then attended Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota[7] He played safety on the Johnnies football team for Hall of Fame coach John Gagliardi[8][9] and was a member of teams that won two conference titles in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. McDonough graduated from Saint John's University with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history and Spanish in 1992. After graduation, he traveled extensively throughout Latin America and taught high school in Belize.[8]\n\n\nIn 1996, McDonough earned an MSFS degree at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, McDonough worked as an aide for the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs,[10] where he focused on Latin America.[3] He then served as a senior foreign policy advisor to Senator Tom Daschle.[8] After Daschle's reelection defeat in 2004, McDonough became legislative director for newly elected Senator Ken Salazar.[8] McDonough was a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in 2004.[3]\n\n\nIn 2007, Senator Barack Obama's chief foreign policy advisor Mark Lippert, a Navy reservist, was called into active duty.[11] Lippert recruited McDonough to serve as his replacement during his deployment to Iraq.[8][12] McDonough continued to serve as a senior foreign policy advisor to Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.[3][13]\n\n\n\n### Obama administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McDonough, seated, third from right in blue shirt, in the Situation Room during the Bin Laden raid.\n![](image)McDonough conferring with Obama about the Cairo Speech, with Ben Rhodes, on June 4, 2009.\nAfter Obama was elected president, McDonough joined the administration as the National Security Council's head of strategic communication.[10] He also served as National Security Council chief of staff.[14]\n\n\nOn October 20, 2010, Obama announced that McDonough would replace Thomas E. Donilon as Deputy National Security Advisor, who had been promoted to succeed General James L. Jones as National Security Advisor.[15] McDonough was seen in photos of the White House Situation Room taken during the monitoring of the May 2011 SEAL operation in Pakistan that resulted in the Osama bin Laden's death.[16]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2013, at the beginning of his second term in office, Obama appointed McDonough his chief of staff.[7] In February 2013 McDonough urged lawmakers to quickly confirm Chuck Hagel and John O. Brennan to their posts in Obama's national security team, expressing \"grave concern\" about the delays. McDonough served as White House chief of staff through the end of Obama's second term, which ended on January 20, 2017.\n\n\n\n### Return to private life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, McDonough joined the Markle Foundation,[17] a nonprofit that aims to \"transform America's outdated labor market to reflect the needs of the digital economy,\" boost employment opportunities, and expand job training for Americans. As a senior principal,[18] he worked to grow the organization nationwide and broaden its work with governments such as the state of Colorado, public institutions such as Arizona State University, and private companies such as LinkedIn.[19][18]\n\n\nMcDonough is a professor of the practice at Notre Dame's Keough School of Global Affairs and a visiting senior fellow in Carnegie's Technology and International Affairs Program.[20][17]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Veterans Affairs (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMcDonough being sworn in on February 9, 2021\n![](image)Secretary McDonough with First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary Xavier Becerra, June 4, 2021\nPresident Joe Biden nominated McDonough to lead the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.[21] He appeared before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on January 27, 2021. On February 8, the Senate confirmed McDonough as VA Secretary by a 87–7 vote, with six senators absent.[22] McDonough is the second non-veteran to hold this position.[23] Vice President Kamala Harris swore him in on February 9.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcDonough is married to Karin Hillstrom.[5] They have three children.[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** @Transition46 (December 10, 2020). \"Working families, veterans, farmers and producers, and those fighting for their place in the middle class will have partners in government once again.

He then served as White House Chief of Staff for the full second term of President Barack Obama from 2013 to 2017.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcDonough was born on December 2, 1969, in Stillwater, Minnesota.[3] He was one of 11 children in a devout Irish Catholic family, his grandparents having emigrated from Connemara in the Gaeltacht.[4][5]\n\n\nMcDonough graduated from Stillwater Area High School in 1988,[6] then attended Saint John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota[7] He played safety on the Johnnies football team for Hall of Fame coach John Gagliardi[8][9] and was a member of teams that won two conference titles in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. McDonough graduated from Saint John's University with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history and Spanish in 1992. After graduation, he traveled extensively throughout Latin America and taught high school in Belize.[8]\n\n\nIn 1996, McDonough earned an MSFS degree at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1996 to 1999, McDonough worked as an aide for the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs,[10] where he focused on Latin America.[3] He then served as a senior foreign policy advisor to Senator Tom Daschle.[8] After Daschle's reelection defeat in 2004, McDonough became legislative director for newly elected Senator Ken Salazar.[8] McDonough was a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress in 2004.[3]\n\n\nIn 2007, Senator Barack Obama's chief foreign policy advisor Mark Lippert, a Navy reservist, was called into active duty.[11] Lippert recruited McDonough to serve as his replacement during his deployment to Iraq.[8][12] McDonough continued to serve as a senior foreign policy advisor to Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign.[3][13]\n\n\n\n### Obama administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McDonough, seated, third from right in blue shirt, in the Situation Room during the Bin Laden raid.\n![](image)McDonough conferring with Obama about the Cairo Speech, with Ben Rhodes, on June 4, 2009.\nAfter Obama was elected president, McDonough joined the administration as the National Security Council's head of strategic communication.[10] He also served as National Security Council chief of staff.[14]\n\n\nOn October 20, 2010, Obama announced that McDonough would replace Thomas E. Donilon as Deputy National Security Advisor, who had been promoted to succeed General James L. Jones as National Security Advisor.[15] McDonough was seen in photos of the White House Situation Room taken during the monitoring of the May 2011 SEAL operation in Pakistan that resulted in the Osama bin Laden's death.[16]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2013, at the beginning of his second term in office, Obama appointed McDonough his chief of staff.[7] In February 2013 McDonough urged lawmakers to quickly confirm Chuck Hagel and John O. Brennan to their posts in Obama's national security team, expressing \"grave concern\" about the delays. McDonough served as White House chief of staff through the end of Obama's second term, which ended on January 20, 2017.\n\n\n\n### Return to private life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, McDonough joined the Markle Foundation,[17] a nonprofit that aims to \"transform America's outdated labor market to reflect the needs of the digital economy,\" boost employment opportunities, and expand job training for Americans. As a senior principal,[18] he worked to grow the organization nationwide and broaden its work with governments such as the state of Colorado, public institutions such as Arizona State University, and private companies such as LinkedIn.[19][18]\n\n\nMcDonough is a professor of the practice at Notre Dame's Keough School of Global Affairs and a visiting senior fellow in Carnegie's Technology and International Affairs Program.[20][17]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Veterans Affairs (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMcDonough being sworn in on February 9, 2021\n![](image)Secretary McDonough with First Lady Jill Biden and Secretary Xavier Becerra, June 4, 2021\nPresident Joe Biden nominated McDonough to lead the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.[21] He appeared before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on January 27, 2021. On February 8, the Senate confirmed McDonough as VA Secretary by a 87–7 vote, with six senators absent.[22] McDonough is the second non-veteran to hold this position.[23] Vice President Kamala Harris swore him in on February 9.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcDonough is married to Karin Hillstrom.[5] They have three children.[5]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** @Transition46 (December 10, 2020). \"Working families, veterans, farmers and producers, and those fighting for their place in the middle class will have partners in government once again.

During the Obama administration, he also served in the Department of Homeland Security, first as director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (2009–2013), and as deputy secretary of DHS (2013–2016).\n\n\nMayorkas was born in Havana, Cuba. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution, his family fled to Florida and later settled in California. He graduated from UC Berkeley in history with honors, subsequently earning his J.D. from Loyola Marymount University. After law school, Mayorkas worked as an Assistant United States Attorney and was appointed the United States attorney for the\nCentral District of California in Los Angeles during the administration of President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, where he oversaw the prosecution of high-profile criminal cases.[2]\n\n\nMayorkas was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama before he assumed office in January 2009, where he led the team responsible for the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division.[3] Mayorkas was appointed by President Obama as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).[4] On May 20, 2009, the nomination was received by the Senate; on August 7, 2009, the nomination was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote.[5] As USCIS director, Mayorkas led United States citizenship through management efficiencies and fiscal responsibility, and safeguarded the integrity of the immigration system.[6] He implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process in sixty days.[7] He led U.S. government efforts to rescue orphaned children following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti and led the advancement of a crime victims unit that, for the first time, made it possible for the agency to issue the statutory maximum number of visas to victims of crime.[6]\n\n\nIn 2016, Mayorkas became a partner at the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, in their Washington, D.C., office.[3] On November 23, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced he would nominate Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security in his Cabinet. Mayorkas's nomination received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police[8] and former secretaries Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff (who served under George W. Bush), Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson (under whom Mayorkas served), who said Biden \"could not have found a more qualified person\".[9] On February 2, 2021, Mayorkas was confirmed by the Senate on a 56–43 vote, with significant Senate Republican opposition.[10] He was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on February 2, 2021.[11] Mayorkas is the first refugee and first person born in Latin America to lead the department.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlejandro Nicholas Mayorkas[13] was born in Havana, Cuba, on November 24, 1959.[4] When he was one year old, his parents fled with him and his sister to the United States in 1960 as refugees, following the Cuban Revolution. He lived in Miami, Florida, before his family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised for the remainder of his youth.[14] Mayorkas grew up in Beverly Hills and attended Beverly Hills High School.[15]\n\n\nHis father, Charles R. \"Nicky\" Mayorkas, was born in Cuba. He was a Cuban Jew of Sephardi (from the former Ottoman Empire, present-day Turkey and Greece) and Ashkenazi (from Poland) background. He owned and operated a steel wool factory on the outskirts of Havana.[14][16][17][18] Nicky Mayorkas studied economics at Dartmouth College.[18]\n\n\nHis mother, Anita (Gabor),[18] was a Romanian Jew whose family escaped the Holocaust and fled to Cuba in the 1940s[19][20][21] before leaving to the United States after the Cuban Revolution.[19]\n\n\nMayorkas earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with distinction from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1981.[22] He received his Juris Doctor from Loyola Law School in 1985.[2]\n\n\n\n## Assistant United States Attorney[edit]\n\n\nAfter three years as a litigation associate in private practice, Mayorkas became an Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of California in 1989.[6] He prosecuted a wide array of federal crimes, developing a specialization in the prosecution of white-collar crime, including tax evasion and money laundering.[18] His prosecutions included the successful prosecution of Operation PolarCap, then the largest money laundering case in the nation; the conviction at trial of Heidi Fleiss on charges of federal conspiracy, tax fraud, and money laundering charges; the successful prosecutions of two largest telemarketing fraud operations that preyed on the elderly; and the successful prosecution of a health care fraud and insurance fraud conspiracy.[2]\n\n\nMayorkas served as the coordinator of the Southern California Telemarketing Fraud Task Force, overseeing the coordination of federal, state, and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies to most aggressively combat telemarketing fraud throughout the Central District of California.[2]\n\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, Mayorkas served as Chief of the Office's General Crimes Section, overseeing the training and trial work of all new Assistant United States Attorneys in the Criminal Division. He received numerous awards from federal law enforcement agencies, including from FBI Director Louis Freeh for the successful prosecution of Operation PolarCap.[2]\n\n\n\n## United States Attorney[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Mayorkas was recommended by Senator Dianne Feinstein and appointed by President Bill Clinton as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, becoming the country's youngest United States Attorney.[23][2] He was appointed on December 21, 1998.[24]\n\n\nMayorkas oversaw the prosecution of high-profile criminal cases, including the prosecution of the Mexican Mafia in death penalty proceedings, the prosecution of Buford O. Furrow Jr. for the murder of a federal postal worker and the hate-motivated shooting of children in a community center, the prosecution of Litton Industries for the payment of bribes abroad, and the takedown of the violent 18th Street gang using RICO statutes.[2]\n\n\nIn late 2000, Mayorkas was one of many California officials who participated in efforts to obtain executive clemency for narcotics trafficker Carlos Vignali Jr., the son of a wealthy Los Angeles businessman. On his last day in office in January 2001, Clinton commuted Vignali's 15-year prison sentence, a controversial decision.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2001, Mayorkas joined O'Melveny & Myers as a litigation partner.[27] In 2008, *The National Law Journal* named Mayorkas one of the \"50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America\".[28]\n\n\nUpon the election of Barack Obama in November 2008, Mayorkas was selected by the president-elect for a role in the presidential transition leading up to the inauguration. He led the transition team responsible for the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division.[3]\n\n\n\n## Obama administration, 2009–2016[edit]\n\n\n### Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Mayorkas was appointed by President Obama as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).[4] On May 20, 2009, the nomination was received by the Senate; on August 7, 2009, the nomination was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote.[5] As USCIS director, Mayorkas led United States citizenship through management efficiencies and fiscal responsibility, and safeguarding the integrity of the immigration system.[6] He implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process in sixty days.[7] He led U.S. government efforts to rescue orphaned children following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti and led the advancement of a crime victims unit that, for the first time, resulted in the ability of the agency to administer the statutory maximum number of visas to victims of crime.[6]\n\n\nFor his work as director of USCIS, Mayorkas received awards from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.[29]\n\n\nIn 2015, a Department of Homeland Security inspector general (DHS IG) report criticized Mayorkas' oversight of the EB-5 investor visa program, which offered lawful permanent resident status (green cards) to foreign investors who invested $500,000 into businesses that created jobs in the U.S.[30] The program's popularity greatly increased under Mayorkas's tenure.[30] The DHS IG report, which was the culmination of an investigation beginning in 2013,[31] focused on allegations that politically connected businesses were given special treatment under the program, focusing specifically on the Sahara casino and hotel in Las Vegas, backed by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and an electric car company led by Terry McAuliffe and involving Anthony Rodham.[30] The report concluded that \"The juxtaposition of Mr. Mayorkas' communication with external stakeholders on specific matters outside the normal procedures, coupled with favorable action that deviated from the regulatory scheme designed to ensure fairness and evenhandedness in adjudicating benefits, created an appearance of favoritism and special access.\"[30] The \"fast-tracking\" of approvals for individuals involved in the casino program was controversial because it was made over the objections of USCIS analysts \"who were suspicious about the source of the funds\".[32]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security[edit]\n\n\nNominated by President Obama in June 2013, Mayorkas was confirmed as the deputy secretary on December 20, 2014, following a party-line Senate vote.[33][13]\n\n\nThe DHS inspector general's investigation into Mayorkas's intervention as USCIS director to expedite reviews for applicants for foreign investor visas in three cases caused controversy and delayed his confirmation proceedings.[34][35] The inspector general's report found that Mayorkas's acts did not violate the law, but did create an appearance of favoritism.[34] In House Homeland Security Committee testimony in May 2015, Mayorkas expressed regret that his intervention created an impression of favoritism, but said his involvement was motivated by a desire to ensure that the applications were handled in accordance with the law: \"I did not let errors go unchecked, but instead helped ensure that those cases were decided correctly, nothing more and nothing less.\"[35]\n\n\nAs deputy secretary, Mayorkas's led DHS's response to the 2013–14 Ebola virus epidemic and 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic.[34][23] His work also focused on cybersecurity.[35] He led the DHS's negotiations with Israel and China on cybersecurity.[36] A landmark agreement reached in 2015 with the Chinese government reduced, for a brief period, Chinese cyberattacks against American companies[37] aimed at the theft of intellectual property.[38] After the normalization of U.S.-Cuba relations, Mayorkas led the Obama administration's delegation to Cuba,[36] and negotiated with the Cuban government on port and cargo security and U.S.-Cuba travel.[20]\n\n\nMayorkas was also involved in the Department's counterterrorism and anti-cybercrime efforts, as well as its public-private partnerships,[39] and efforts to fight antisemitism.[20] Under Mayorkas's tenure, DHS greatly expanded its Cyber Crimes Center in Fairfax, Virginia, to aid the department's efforts to combat various cybercrimes, ranging from child exploitation to computer hacking and intellectual property theft.[40] Mayorkas was involved in efforts to address DHS's presence on GAO's \"high risk list\" for management challenges;[39] Mayorkas, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, acknowledged low morale among DHS employees (a longstanding problem that pre-dated the Obama administration) and took steps aimed at boosting morale.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## Return to private practice, 2017–2020[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Mayorkas joined the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr in the firm's Washington office.[43]\n\n\n\n## Biden administration, 2021–present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mayorkas arrives at the DHS headquarters following his swearing-in as secretary, 2021\n### Secretary of Homeland Security[edit]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced his plan to nominate Mayorkas to be Secretary of Homeland Security.[44][45]\nMayorkas had the support of the Fraternal Order of Police[8] and endorsements from former secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff (who served under George W. Bush) and Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson (who served under Barack Obama), who said Biden \"could not have found a more qualified person\".[9] Most Senate Republicans however opposed the nomination; Josh Hawley delayed a speedy confirmation, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged his caucus to vote against confirmation.[46][47]\n\n\nUltimately, Mayorkas was confirmed on a 56–43 vote.[48] This made Mayorkas' appointment the most contested of all Biden's cabinet nominees.[49] Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman, Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Dan Sullivan voted with the Democrats to confirm Mayorkas.[48] Mayorkas was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on February 2, 2021, after his confirmation that day.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. The reason given is: More information about impeachment efforts against him is needed. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(November 2023)*\n |\n\n\nEarly on in his tenure, arrests surged at the Mexico-United States border. In June 2021, the monthly number of intercepted migrants reached a decade high of 188,800.[50]\n\n\nOn October 19, 2021, Mayorkas tested positive for COVID-19 during a test performed as part of pre-travel protocol. He experienced mild symptoms, forcing him to cancel a trip to Bogotá, Colombia, and to reschedule a Senate hearing.[51]\n\n\nTestifying to the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations on April 27, 2022, Mayorkas confirmed that the Biden administration will implement a \"Disinformation Working Group\" in the DHS with the intention to \"develop guidelines, standards, [and] guardrails\" to shape the department's longstanding effort to counter disinformation.[52][53] Three weeks later, after critics called the initiative \"a violation of free speech\" and its executive director Nina Jankowicz had resigned, the Disinformation Working Group was \"paused\".[54]\n\n\nIn September 2021, a photo circulated of Border Patrol agents using their \"long rein\" to control horses; however, the photo appeared to show them \"whipping\" Haitian migrants. Upon its release, the image generated outrage. Initially, Mayorkas defended the actions of agents, but later, at a White House press conference, condemned their actions and pledged to investigate them.\n\n\nIn October 2022, The Heritage Foundation released emails that showed hours before the press conference Mayorkas received emails that disproved the whipping claim, including from the photographer himself. Republicans condemned Mayorkas upon the emails' release. Senator Ted Cruz, Representatives Andy Biggs, Michael Cloud and Vicky Hartzler had, by October 2022, raised the prospect of impeaching Mayorkas. Chief of the United States Border Patrol under President Obama and acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under President Trump Mark A. Morgan also condemned Mayorkas's actions.[55][56][57][*better source needed*]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2023, Representative Marjorie Taylor Green filed a motion to impeach Mayorkas, citing a dereliction of duty and saying he \"failed to maintain operational control of the [Southern] border\".[58] The motion to impeach failed to pass on November 13th, with the House voting 209-201 to defer the resolution to the House Homeland Security Committee. Eight Republicans joined all Democrats in referring the article of impeachment.[59][60]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMayorkas and his wife Tanya have two daughters, Giselle and Amelia.[61] He is a runner and plays tennis and squash.[34]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Alejandro Mayorkas\". *The Hill*.

During the Obama administration, he also served in the Department of Homeland Security, first as director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (2009–2013), and as deputy secretary of DHS (2013–2016).\n\n\nMayorkas was born in Havana, Cuba. Shortly after the Cuban Revolution, his family fled to Florida and later settled in California. He graduated from UC Berkeley in history with honors, subsequently earning his J.D. from Loyola Marymount University. After law school, Mayorkas worked as an Assistant United States Attorney and was appointed the United States attorney for the\nCentral District of California in Los Angeles during the administration of President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, where he oversaw the prosecution of high-profile criminal cases.[2]\n\n\nMayorkas was a member of the presidential transition team for Barack Obama before he assumed office in January 2009, where he led the team responsible for the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division.[3] Mayorkas was appointed by President Obama as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).[4] On May 20, 2009, the nomination was received by the Senate; on August 7, 2009, the nomination was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote.[5] As USCIS director, Mayorkas led United States citizenship through management efficiencies and fiscal responsibility, and safeguarded the integrity of the immigration system.[6] He implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process in sixty days.[7] He led U.S. government efforts to rescue orphaned children following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti and led the advancement of a crime victims unit that, for the first time, made it possible for the agency to issue the statutory maximum number of visas to victims of crime.[6]\n\n\nIn 2016, Mayorkas became a partner at the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, in their Washington, D.C., office.[3] On November 23, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced he would nominate Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security in his Cabinet. Mayorkas's nomination received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police[8] and former secretaries Tom Ridge, Michael Chertoff (who served under George W. Bush), Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson (under whom Mayorkas served), who said Biden \"could not have found a more qualified person\".[9] On February 2, 2021, Mayorkas was confirmed by the Senate on a 56–43 vote, with significant Senate Republican opposition.[10] He was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on February 2, 2021.[11] Mayorkas is the first refugee and first person born in Latin America to lead the department.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlejandro Nicholas Mayorkas[13] was born in Havana, Cuba, on November 24, 1959.[4] When he was one year old, his parents fled with him and his sister to the United States in 1960 as refugees, following the Cuban Revolution. He lived in Miami, Florida, before his family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised for the remainder of his youth.[14] Mayorkas grew up in Beverly Hills and attended Beverly Hills High School.[15]\n\n\nHis father, Charles R. \"Nicky\" Mayorkas, was born in Cuba. He was a Cuban Jew of Sephardi (from the former Ottoman Empire, present-day Turkey and Greece) and Ashkenazi (from Poland) background. He owned and operated a steel wool factory on the outskirts of Havana.[14][16][17][18] Nicky Mayorkas studied economics at Dartmouth College.[18]\n\n\nHis mother, Anita (Gabor),[18] was a Romanian Jew whose family escaped the Holocaust and fled to Cuba in the 1940s[19][20][21] before leaving to the United States after the Cuban Revolution.[19]\n\n\nMayorkas earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with distinction from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1981.[22] He received his Juris Doctor from Loyola Law School in 1985.[2]\n\n\n\n## Assistant United States Attorney[edit]\n\n\nAfter three years as a litigation associate in private practice, Mayorkas became an Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of California in 1989.[6] He prosecuted a wide array of federal crimes, developing a specialization in the prosecution of white-collar crime, including tax evasion and money laundering.[18] His prosecutions included the successful prosecution of Operation PolarCap, then the largest money laundering case in the nation; the conviction at trial of Heidi Fleiss on charges of federal conspiracy, tax fraud, and money laundering charges; the successful prosecutions of two largest telemarketing fraud operations that preyed on the elderly; and the successful prosecution of a health care fraud and insurance fraud conspiracy.[2]\n\n\nMayorkas served as the coordinator of the Southern California Telemarketing Fraud Task Force, overseeing the coordination of federal, state, and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies to most aggressively combat telemarketing fraud throughout the Central District of California.[2]\n\n\nFrom 1996 to 1998, Mayorkas served as Chief of the Office's General Crimes Section, overseeing the training and trial work of all new Assistant United States Attorneys in the Criminal Division. He received numerous awards from federal law enforcement agencies, including from FBI Director Louis Freeh for the successful prosecution of Operation PolarCap.[2]\n\n\n\n## United States Attorney[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Mayorkas was recommended by Senator Dianne Feinstein and appointed by President Bill Clinton as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, becoming the country's youngest United States Attorney.[23][2] He was appointed on December 21, 1998.[24]\n\n\nMayorkas oversaw the prosecution of high-profile criminal cases, including the prosecution of the Mexican Mafia in death penalty proceedings, the prosecution of Buford O. Furrow Jr. for the murder of a federal postal worker and the hate-motivated shooting of children in a community center, the prosecution of Litton Industries for the payment of bribes abroad, and the takedown of the violent 18th Street gang using RICO statutes.[2]\n\n\nIn late 2000, Mayorkas was one of many California officials who participated in efforts to obtain executive clemency for narcotics trafficker Carlos Vignali Jr., the son of a wealthy Los Angeles businessman. On his last day in office in January 2001, Clinton commuted Vignali's 15-year prison sentence, a controversial decision.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2001, Mayorkas joined O'Melveny & Myers as a litigation partner.[27] In 2008, *The National Law Journal* named Mayorkas one of the \"50 Most Influential Minority Lawyers in America\".[28]\n\n\nUpon the election of Barack Obama in November 2008, Mayorkas was selected by the president-elect for a role in the presidential transition leading up to the inauguration. He led the transition team responsible for the U.S. Department of Justice's Criminal Division.[3]\n\n\n\n## Obama administration, 2009–2016[edit]\n\n\n### Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Mayorkas was appointed by President Obama as the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).[4] On May 20, 2009, the nomination was received by the Senate; on August 7, 2009, the nomination was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote.[5] As USCIS director, Mayorkas led United States citizenship through management efficiencies and fiscal responsibility, and safeguarding the integrity of the immigration system.[6] He implemented the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) process in sixty days.[7] He led U.S. government efforts to rescue orphaned children following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti and led the advancement of a crime victims unit that, for the first time, resulted in the ability of the agency to administer the statutory maximum number of visas to victims of crime.[6]\n\n\nFor his work as director of USCIS, Mayorkas received awards from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.[29]\n\n\nIn 2015, a Department of Homeland Security inspector general (DHS IG) report criticized Mayorkas' oversight of the EB-5 investor visa program, which offered lawful permanent resident status (green cards) to foreign investors who invested $500,000 into businesses that created jobs in the U.S.[30] The program's popularity greatly increased under Mayorkas's tenure.[30] The DHS IG report, which was the culmination of an investigation beginning in 2013,[31] focused on allegations that politically connected businesses were given special treatment under the program, focusing specifically on the Sahara casino and hotel in Las Vegas, backed by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and an electric car company led by Terry McAuliffe and involving Anthony Rodham.[30] The report concluded that \"The juxtaposition of Mr. Mayorkas' communication with external stakeholders on specific matters outside the normal procedures, coupled with favorable action that deviated from the regulatory scheme designed to ensure fairness and evenhandedness in adjudicating benefits, created an appearance of favoritism and special access.\"[30] The \"fast-tracking\" of approvals for individuals involved in the casino program was controversial because it was made over the objections of USCIS analysts \"who were suspicious about the source of the funds\".[32]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security[edit]\n\n\nNominated by President Obama in June 2013, Mayorkas was confirmed as the deputy secretary on December 20, 2014, following a party-line Senate vote.[33][13]\n\n\nThe DHS inspector general's investigation into Mayorkas's intervention as USCIS director to expedite reviews for applicants for foreign investor visas in three cases caused controversy and delayed his confirmation proceedings.[34][35] The inspector general's report found that Mayorkas's acts did not violate the law, but did create an appearance of favoritism.[34] In House Homeland Security Committee testimony in May 2015, Mayorkas expressed regret that his intervention created an impression of favoritism, but said his involvement was motivated by a desire to ensure that the applications were handled in accordance with the law: \"I did not let errors go unchecked, but instead helped ensure that those cases were decided correctly, nothing more and nothing less.\"[35]\n\n\nAs deputy secretary, Mayorkas's led DHS's response to the 2013–14 Ebola virus epidemic and 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic.[34][23] His work also focused on cybersecurity.[35] He led the DHS's negotiations with Israel and China on cybersecurity.[36] A landmark agreement reached in 2015 with the Chinese government reduced, for a brief period, Chinese cyberattacks against American companies[37] aimed at the theft of intellectual property.[38] After the normalization of U.S.-Cuba relations, Mayorkas led the Obama administration's delegation to Cuba,[36] and negotiated with the Cuban government on port and cargo security and U.S.-Cuba travel.[20]\n\n\nMayorkas was also involved in the Department's counterterrorism and anti-cybercrime efforts, as well as its public-private partnerships,[39] and efforts to fight antisemitism.[20] Under Mayorkas's tenure, DHS greatly expanded its Cyber Crimes Center in Fairfax, Virginia, to aid the department's efforts to combat various cybercrimes, ranging from child exploitation to computer hacking and intellectual property theft.[40] Mayorkas was involved in efforts to address DHS's presence on GAO's \"high risk list\" for management challenges;[39] Mayorkas, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, acknowledged low morale among DHS employees (a longstanding problem that pre-dated the Obama administration) and took steps aimed at boosting morale.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## Return to private practice, 2017–2020[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Mayorkas joined the law firm of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr in the firm's Washington office.[43]\n\n\n\n## Biden administration, 2021–present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mayorkas arrives at the DHS headquarters following his swearing-in as secretary, 2021\n### Secretary of Homeland Security[edit]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden announced his plan to nominate Mayorkas to be Secretary of Homeland Security.[44][45]\nMayorkas had the support of the Fraternal Order of Police[8] and endorsements from former secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff (who served under George W. Bush) and Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson (who served under Barack Obama), who said Biden \"could not have found a more qualified person\".[9] Most Senate Republicans however opposed the nomination; Josh Hawley delayed a speedy confirmation, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged his caucus to vote against confirmation.[46][47]\n\n\nUltimately, Mayorkas was confirmed on a 56–43 vote.[48] This made Mayorkas' appointment the most contested of all Biden's cabinet nominees.[49] Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito, Rob Portman, Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Dan Sullivan voted with the Democrats to confirm Mayorkas.[48] Mayorkas was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on February 2, 2021, after his confirmation that day.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. The reason given is: More information about impeachment efforts against him is needed. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(November 2023)*\n |\n\n\nEarly on in his tenure, arrests surged at the Mexico-United States border. In June 2021, the monthly number of intercepted migrants reached a decade high of 188,800.[50]\n\n\nOn October 19, 2021, Mayorkas tested positive for COVID-19 during a test performed as part of pre-travel protocol. He experienced mild symptoms, forcing him to cancel a trip to Bogotá, Colombia, and to reschedule a Senate hearing.[51]\n\n\nTestifying to the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations on April 27, 2022, Mayorkas confirmed that the Biden administration will implement a \"Disinformation Working Group\" in the DHS with the intention to \"develop guidelines, standards, [and] guardrails\" to shape the department's longstanding effort to counter disinformation.[52][53] Three weeks later, after critics called the initiative \"a violation of free speech\" and its executive director Nina Jankowicz had resigned, the Disinformation Working Group was \"paused\".[54]\n\n\nIn September 2021, a photo circulated of Border Patrol agents using their \"long rein\" to control horses; however, the photo appeared to show them \"whipping\" Haitian migrants. Upon its release, the image generated outrage. Initially, Mayorkas defended the actions of agents, but later, at a White House press conference, condemned their actions and pledged to investigate them.\n\n\nIn October 2022, The Heritage Foundation released emails that showed hours before the press conference Mayorkas received emails that disproved the whipping claim, including from the photographer himself. Republicans condemned Mayorkas upon the emails' release. Senator Ted Cruz, Representatives Andy Biggs, Michael Cloud and Vicky Hartzler had, by October 2022, raised the prospect of impeaching Mayorkas. Chief of the United States Border Patrol under President Obama and acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection under President Trump Mark A. Morgan also condemned Mayorkas's actions.[55][56][57][*better source needed*]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2023, Representative Marjorie Taylor Green filed a motion to impeach Mayorkas, citing a dereliction of duty and saying he \"failed to maintain operational control of the [Southern] border\".[58] The motion to impeach failed to pass on November 13th, with the House voting 209-201 to defer the resolution to the House Homeland Security Committee. Eight Republicans joined all Democrats in referring the article of impeachment.[59][60]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMayorkas and his wife Tanya have two daughters, Giselle and Amelia.[61] He is a runner and plays tennis and squash.[34]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Alejandro Mayorkas\". *The Hill*.
