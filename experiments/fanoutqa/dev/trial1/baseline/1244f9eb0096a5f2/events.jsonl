As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history.[155] The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines.[156] On October 1, the U.S. passed 700,000 deaths.[157] On October 18, the U.S. passed 45 million cases.[158] On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron.[159]\n\n\n\n### December 2021 to March 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Ollstein AM (April 14, 2020). \"Trump halts funding to World Health Organization\". *Politico*.

Fauci warned of an \"uptick\" in cases like Europe has seen recently, stating the U.S. should \"be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant\".[163]\n\n\n\n### April to June 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant.[146] By July 7, the Delta variant had surpassed the Alpha variant to become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S., according to CDC data.[147] By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[148]\n\n\nOn August 1, the U.S. passed 35 million cases.[149] By early and mid-August, hospitals in some states with low vaccination rates began to exceed capacity.[150] One-quarter of the U.S. population resides in eight states—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas—but, by mid-August, these states together had a half of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the nation.[151] By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas—were over 90% full.[152]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19.[84] State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast.[85] A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey.[86][87][88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Wayland M (January 30, 2020). \"Trump says coronavirus outbreak is 'all under control' and a 'very small problem' in US\".

The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21,[59] by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County.[60] The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November.[61] On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.[62][63] The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case.[64][65][66] Another case known as \"patient zero\" in Los Angeles is a man named Gregg Garfield, who spent 64 days in the Burbank Hospital, on a ventilator for 30 days, with a 1% chance to live. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"Boeing donating 250,000 medical masks to battle coronavirus in China\".

The totals for these two months reflect about 1.6 times the number of cases and 0.81 times the number of deaths from the same months in 2021.[160]\n\n\nOn September 18, 2022, in an appearance on *60 Minutes*, president Joe Biden declared his belief that the COVID-19 pandemic was \"over\" in the United States.[175][176] This assessment met some debate in the medical community: at the time, the United States had roughly 400 deaths from the disease per day, and when extrapolated to 150,000 per year is three times the fatality rate of a bad flu season.[177]\n\n\nThe number of cases for the months of July through September 2022 was about 0.86 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.42 times the number for the same period in 2021.[160]\n\n\n\n### October to December 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Montague, Zach (January 30, 2021). \"The C.D.C.

The film studio, Lionsgate, however, briefly reinstated a mask mandate following an outbreak, as did Morris Brown College, which also reinstated temperature checks and a restriction on large events for two weeks, at the beginning of the fall 2023 semester.[195] As more schools launched their fall semesters in late August and early September, high positivity rates among students and staff led to temporary in-person learning suspensions across three school districts in Texas and Tennessee, driven by district-level decisions rather than state authorities.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese paragraphs are an excerpt from COVID-19 vaccination in the United States.[edit]\nThe COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States is an ongoing mass immunization campaign for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

Some states like Texas and Arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Privacy concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in South Korea where authorities used cellphone tracking and credit card details to locate and test thousands of nightclub patrons when new cases began emerging.[205] Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631 million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6 billion will be needed. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Washington Post Live (April 25, 2023). \"Transcript: Global Health: Lessons from the Pandemic with Philip Zelikow and Charity Dean\". *The Washington Post*.

There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare.[29][30] There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2022-05-15 |  | 74,690,082(+16,251) | 946,959(+31) |\n| 2022-05-16 |  | 74,789,428(+99,346) | 947,183(+224) |\n| 2022-05-17 |  | 74,895,446(+106,018) | 947,526(+343) |\n| 2022-05-18 |  | 75,055,651(+160,205) | 948,106(+580) |\n| 2022-05-19 |  | 75,132,281(+76,630) | 948,415(+309) |\n| 2022-05-20 |  | 75,341,674(+209,393) | 949,199(+784) |\n| 2022-05-21 |  | 75,370,367(+28,693) | 949,212(+13) |\n| 2022-05-22 |  | 75,387,266(+16,899) | 949,245(+33) |\n| 2022-05-23 |  | 75,475,425(+88,159) | 949,433(+188) |\n| 2022-05-24 |  | 75,584,406(+108,981) | 949,727(+294) |\n| 2022-05-25 |  | 75,756,923(+172,517) | 950,632(+905) |\n| 2022-05-26 |  | 75,843,978(+87,055) | 950,936(+304) |\n| 2022-05-27 |  | 75,952,031(+108,053) | 951,405(+469) |\n| 2022-05-28 |  | 75,958,574(+6,543) | 951,438(+33) |\n| 2022-05-29 |  | 75,959,894(+1,320) | 951,445(+7) |\n| 2022-05-30 |  | 75,977,949(+18,055) | 951,458(+13) |\n| 2022-05-31 |  | 76,095,745(+117,796) | 951,775(+317) |\n| 2022-06-01 |  | 76,332,257(+236,512) | 952,537(+762) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) booster vaccine\". *NHS*.

The CDC recommended vaccinations, treatments for immunocompromised individuals and to reduce severity of the disease, and continuing to wear masks in public.[181] Nonetheless, Dr. Anthony Fauci stated that the Biden administration felt that there was \"enough community protection that we're not going to see a repeat of what we saw last year at this time,\" referring to the emergence of the Omicron variant.[182]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy July 4, 2021, 67% of the United States' adult population had received at least one dose, just short of a goal of 70%. This goal was met on August 2, 2021. While vaccines have helped significantly reduce the number of new COVID-19 infections nationwide, states with below-average vaccination rates began to see increasing numbers of cases credited to the highly infectious Delta variant by July 2021, which led to an increased push by organizations and companies to begin imposing *de facto* mandates for their employees be vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021-05-14 |  | 30,450,659(+34,670) | 552,402(+705) |\n| 2021-05-15 |  | 30,477,058(+26,399) | 552,891(+489) |\n| 2021-05-16 |  | 30,493,068(+16,010) | 553,204(+313) |\n| 2021-05-17 |  | 30,517,056(+23,988) | 553,552(+348) |\n| 2021-05-18 |  | 30,540,698(+23,642) | 554,365(+813) |\n| 2021-05-19 |  | 30,565,676(+24,978) | 554,949(+584) |\n| 2021-05-20 |  | 30,591,572(+25,896) | 555,582(+633) |\n| 2021-05-21 |  | 30,616,807(+25,235) | 556,266(+684) |\n| 2021-05-22 |  | 30,635,031(+18,224) | 556,744(+478) |\n| 2021-05-23 |  | 30,648,623(+13,592) | 556,938(+194) |\n| 2021-05-24 |  | 30,666,928(+18,305) | 557,273(+335) |\n| 2021-05-25 |  | 30,688,662(+21,734) | 557,935(+662) |\n| 2021-05-26 |  | 30,709,427(+20,765) | 558,862(+927) |\n| 2021-05-27 |  | 30,729,607(+20,180) | 560,008(+1,146) |\n| 2021-05-28 |  | 30,752,365(+22,758) | 560,724(+716) |\n| 2021-05-29 |  | 30,763,725(+11,360) | 561,006(+282) |\n| 2021-05-30 |  | 30,771,202(+7,477) | 561,135(+129) |\n| 2021-05-31 |  | 30,776,156(+4,954) | 561,265(+130) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n238. **^** Abelson R (March 28, 2020). \"Coronavirus May Add Billions to the Nation's Health Care Bill\". *The New York Times*.

Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors.[315] With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates.[316]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020-04-02 |  | 241,626(+28,879) | 5,821(+1,075) |\n| 2020-04-03 |  | 274,151(+32,525) | 7,006(+1,185) |\n| 2020-04-04 |  | 307,876(+33,725) | 8,359(+1,353) |\n| 2020-04-05 |  | 333,593(+25,717) | 9,534(+1,175) |\n| 2020-04-06 |  | 362,952(+29,359) | 10,746(+1,212) |\n| 2020-04-07 |  | 393,464(+30,512) | 12,674(+1,928) |\n| 2020-04-08 |  | 425,746(+32,282) | 14,610(+1,936) |\n| 2020-04-09 |  | 459,989(+34,243) | 16,466(+1,856) |\n| 2020-04-10 |  | 493,567(+33,578) | 18,544(+2,078) |\n| 2020-04-11 |  | 525,436(+31,869) | 20,443(+1,899) |\n| 2020-04-12 |  | 553,493(+28,057) | 21,936(+1,493) |\n| 2020-04-13 |  | 578,178(+24,685) | 23,398(+1,462) |\n| 2020-04-14 |  | 604,165(+25,987) | 25,776(+2,378) |\n| 2020-04-15 |  | 633,630(+29,465) | 28,214(+2,438) |\n| 2020-04-16 |  | 665,706(+32,076) | 30,355(+2,141) |\n| 2020-04-17 |  | 696,621(+30,915) | 32,435(+2,080) |\n| 2020-04-18 |  | 724,705(+28,084) | 34,178(+1,743) |\n| 2020-04-19 |  | 750,718(+26,013) | 35,812(+1,634) |\n| 2020-04-20 |  | 775,850(+25,132) | 37,455(+1,643) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2024-05-11 |  |  | 1,159,495(+18) |\n| 2024-05-12 |  |  | 1,159,502(+7) |\n| 2024-05-13 |  |  | 1,159,522(+20) |\n| 2024-05-14 |  |  | 1,159,566(+44) |\n| 2024-05-15 |  |  | 1,159,654(+88) |\n| 2024-05-16 |  |  | 1,159,695(+41) |\n| 2024-05-17 |  |  | 1,159,785(+90) |\n| 2024-05-18 |  |  | 1,159,790(+5) |\n| 2024-05-19 |  |  | 1,159,791(+1) |\n| 2024-05-20 |  |  | 1,159,805(+14) |\n| 2024-05-21 |  |  | 1,159,809(+4) |\n| 2024-05-22 |  |  | 1,159,896(+87) |\n| 2024-05-23 |  |  | 1,159,949(+53) |\n| 2024-05-24 |  |  | 1,160,037(+88) |\n| 2024-05-25 |  |  | 1,160,045(+8) |\n| 2024-05-26 |  |  | 1,160,046(+1) |\n| 2024-05-27 |  |  | 1,160,051(+5) |\n| 2024-05-28 |  |  | 1,160,082(+31) |\n| 2024-05-29 |  |  | 1,160,281(+199) |\n| 2024-05-30 |  |  | 1,160,322(+41) |\n| 2024-05-31 |  |  | 1,160,412(+90) |\n| 2024-06-01 |  |  | 1,160,435(+23) |\n| 2024-06-02 |  |  | 1,160,439(+4) |\n| 2024-06-03 |  |  | 1,160,456(+17) |\n| 2024-06-04 |  |  | 1,160,501(+45) |\n| 2024-06-05 |  |  | 1,160,621(+120) |\n| 2024-06-06 |  |  | 1,160,662(+41) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n186. **^** Klein, Betsy; Luhby, Tami (January 11, 2023). \"Biden administration renews Covid-19 public health emergency\".

An NPR analysis of April–September 2020 data from the COVID Tracking Project found that Black people's share of COVID-19 deaths across the United States was 1.5 times greater (in some states 2.5 times greater) than their share of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanics and Latinos were disproportionately infected in 45 states and had a disproportionate share of the deaths in 19 states. Native American and Alaskan Native cases and deaths were disproportionally high in at least 21 states and, in some, as much as five times more than average. White non-Hispanics died at a lower rate than their share of the population in 36 states and D.C.[264]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020-11-05 |  | 9,367,997(+113,498) | 222,076(+1,132) |\n|

D.C.\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020.[235] The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020,[236] and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April.[237] The total healthcare costs of treating the epidemic could be anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion according to analysis presented by *The New York Times*.[238] A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns.[239] During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019.[240]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe U.S. government began the campaign under the presidency of Donald Trump with Operation Warp Speed, a public–private partnership to expedite the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines.

Biden had an immediate goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses within his first hundred days in office, and signed an executive order which increased supplies for vaccination.[300][301][302] This goal was met on March 19, 2021.[303] On March 25, 2021, he announced he would increase the goal to 200 million within his first 100 days in office.[304] This goal was reached on April 21, 2021.[305]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023-04-14 |  | 93,726,905(+3,935) | 1,069,932(+271) |\n| 2023-04-15 |  | 93,726,955(+50) | 1,069,935(+3) |\n| 2023-04-16 |  | 93,727,043(+88) | 1,069,935(=) |\n| 2023-04-17 |  | 93,734,862(+7,819) | 1,070,002(+67) |\n| 2023-04-18 |  | 93,745,244(+10,382) | 1,070,157(+155) |\n| 2023-04-19 |  | 93,783,318(+38,074) | 1,070,627(+470) |\n| 2023-04-20 |  | 93,808,253(+24,935) | 1,071,074(+447) |\n| 2023-04-21 |  | 93,810,561(+2,308) | 1,071,095(+21) |\n| 2023-04-22 |  | 93,810,644(+83) | 1,071,097(+2) |\n| 2023-04-23 |  | 93,810,725(+81) | 1,071,097(=) |\n| 2023-04-24 |  | 93,816,049(+5,324) | 1,071,172(+75) |\n| 2023-04-25 |  | 93,822,797(+6,748) | 1,071,348(+176) |\n| 2023-04-26 |  | 93,862,886(+40,089) | 1,071,746(+398) |\n| 2023-04-27 |  | 93,885,020(+22,134) | 1,072,105(+359) |\n| 2023-04-28 |  | 93,890,984(+5,964) | 1,072,559(+454) |\n| 2023-04-29 |  | 93,891,195(+211) | 1,072,561(+2) |\n| 2023-04-30 |  | 93,891,276(+81) | 1,072,561(=) |\n| 2023-05-01 |  | 93,894,961(+3,685) | 1,072,630(+69) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n285. **^** Greenberger LM, Saltzman LA, Senefeld JW, Johnson PW, DeGennaro LJ, Nichols GL (August 2021). \"Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with hematologic malignancies\". *Cancer Cell*. **39** (8): 1031–1033. doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2021.07.012.

following vaccination are still not getting sick and not dying like was happening before vaccination.\"[278] By late August 2021, the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of U.S. cases and was found to double the risk of severe illness and hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[279]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a study by the ECDC estimated that 470,000 lives over the age of 60 had been saved

baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).[209] In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19

by CNN that COVID-19 numbers reached pandemic lows across the US, resulting in many testing sites closing their doors. With testing sites seeing as low as single digits per day, Director of Public Health Services Division of the Haywood County Health and Human Services Agency in North Carolina Sarah Henderson suggested that she expected most counties to see closures soon, if they hadn't already. \"We were seeing an excess of 100 patients at our testing site in the first few days [of January], which doesn't sound like a lot, but our community is very small,\" Henderson said. \"The last couple of weeks, we have seen single digits every day. I certainly won't speak for other counties, but I think we're probably heading in that direction where if they're not closing down, they're decreasing hours and staff.\"[164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2022-02-15 |  | 70,828,575(+87,360) | 874,755(+2,370) |\n| 2022-02-16 |  | 70,971,781(+143,206) | 878,289(+3,534) |\n| 2022-02-17 |  | 71,050,716(+78,935) | 880,328(+2,039) |\n| 2022-02-18 |  | 71,180,629(+129,913) | 883,741(+3,413) |\n| 2022-02-19 |  | 71,207,823(+27,194) | 884,368(+627) |\n| 2022-02-20 |  | 71,220,709(+12,886) | 884,619(+251) |\n| 2022-02-21 |  | 71,262,880(+42,171) | 885,237(+618) |\n| 2022-02-22 |  | 71,372,578(+109,698) | 888,036(+2,799) |\n| 2022-02-23 |  | 71,461,606(+89,028) | 891,405(+3,369) |\n| 2022-02-24 |  | 71,512,874(+51,268) | 893,514(+2,109) |\n| 2022-02-25 |  | 71,602,022(+89,148) | 896,477(+2,963) |\n| 2022-02-26 |  | 71,618,021(+15,999) | 896,914(+437) |\n| 2022-02-27 |  | 71,624,034(+6,013) | 897,008(+94) |\n| 2022-02-28 |  | 71,701,306(+77,272) | 898,938(+1,930) |\n| 2022-03-01 |  | 71,735,729(+34,423) | 900,506(+1,568) |\n| 2022-03-02 |  | 71,794,005(+58,276) | 902,786(+2,280) |\n| 2022-03-03 |  | 71,850,206(+56,201) | 904,037(+1,251) |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_RrKvssyHfm6ePZV2jkQIC6vf","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

As a result, COVID-19 became the deadliest respiratory pandemic in recent American history.[155] The Associated Press called the new numbers a \"colossal tragedy\" because, despite a century of advances in science, the country failed to take full advantage of vaccines.[156] On October 1, the U.S. passed 700,000 deaths.[157] On October 18, the U.S. passed 45 million cases.[158] On November 26, Biden announced that the U.S. will restrict travel from South Africa and seven other African countries due to concerns over a new variant from the area, called Omicron.[159]\n\n\n\n### December 2021 to March 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Ollstein AM (April 14, 2020). \"Trump halts funding to World Health Organization\". *Politico*.

Fauci warned of an \"uptick\" in cases like Europe has seen recently, stating the U.S. should \"be prepared for the possibility that we might get another variant\".[163]\n\n\n\n### April to June 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy June, COVID-19 cases rose again, especially in Arkansas, Nevada, Missouri, and Wyoming. The rising numbers were believed to be attributable to the Delta variant.[146] By July 7, the Delta variant had surpassed the Alpha variant to become the dominant COVID-19 strain in the U.S., according to CDC data.[147] By August the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of all cases and was found to double the risk of hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[148]\n\n\nOn August 1, the U.S. passed 35 million cases.[149] By early and mid-August, hospitals in some states with low vaccination rates began to exceed capacity.[150] One-quarter of the U.S. population resides in eight states—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Texas—but, by mid-August, these states together had a half of COVID-19 hospitalizations in the nation.[151] By the end of the month, the ICUs of five of those—Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, and Texas—were over 90% full.[152]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19.[84] State economic reopenings and lack of widespread mask orders resulted in a sharp rise in cases across most of the continental U.S. outside of the Northeast.[85] A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey.[86][87][88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Wayland M (January 30, 2020). \"Trump says coronavirus outbreak is 'all under control' and a 'very small problem' in US\".

The CDC did not report its confirmation until April 21,[59] by which point nine other COVID-19 deaths had occurred in Santa Clara County.[60] The virus had been circulating undetected at least since early January and possibly as early as November.[61] On February 25, the CDC warned the American public for the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.[62][63] The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case.[64][65][66] Another case known as \"patient zero\" in Los Angeles is a man named Gregg Garfield, who spent 64 days in the Burbank Hospital, on a ventilator for 30 days, with a 1% chance to live. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n202. **^** \"Boeing donating 250,000 medical masks to battle coronavirus in China\".

The totals for these two months reflect about 1.6 times the number of cases and 0.81 times the number of deaths from the same months in 2021.[160]\n\n\nOn September 18, 2022, in an appearance on *60 Minutes*, president Joe Biden declared his belief that the COVID-19 pandemic was \"over\" in the United States.[175][176] This assessment met some debate in the medical community: at the time, the United States had roughly 400 deaths from the disease per day, and when extrapolated to 150,000 per year is three times the fatality rate of a bad flu season.[177]\n\n\nThe number of cases for the months of July through September 2022 was about 0.86 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.42 times the number for the same period in 2021.[160]\n\n\n\n### October to December 2022[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n125. **^** Montague, Zach (January 30, 2021). \"The C.D.C.

By mid-March 2020, 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as \"a real threat\", while only 40% of Republicans agreed.[230] In mid-March, various polls found Democrats were more likely than Republicans to believe \"the worst was yet to come\" (79–40%), to believe their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak (56–26%),[231] and to take certain precautions against the virus (83–53%).[232] The CDC was the most trusted source of information about the outbreak (85%), followed by the WHO (77%), state and local government officials (70–71%), the news media (47%), and Trump (46%).[232] A May 2020 poll concluded that 54% of people in the U.S. felt the federal government was doing a poor job in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDisproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations.[34][35][36] Of four studies published in September 2020, three found clear disparities due to race and the fourth found slightly better survival rates for Hispanics and Blacks.[258] As of September 15, 2020, Blacks had COVID-19 mortality rates more than twice as high as the rate for Whites and Asians, who have the lowest rates.[259] CNN reported in May 2020 that the Navajo Nation had the highest rate of infection in the United States.[260] In June 2021, the CDC confirmed these numbers, reporting that American Indian or Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic persons had the highest rates of both hospitalizations and deaths, while Hispanic and Latino persons suffered the highest rates of COVID compared to White persons. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStates like California saw over ten times more cases than they had just a few months earlier. By mid-August 2021, nearly all states experienced double-digit growth in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Some, like Washington, had a 34% increase of patients over a single week in September. At various medical centers, ICUs had reached capacity, forcing doctors to postpone routine surgeries. In addition, countless hospitals were also short of beds and nurses, making care and response times a lot slower. It meant that patients might wait in the ER for many hours. While some hospitals with no more capacity had to find alternate medical facilities in other states, often hundreds of miles away.\n\n\n\nEmergency medical services in the United States also experienced a significant labor shortage, lengthening the time it took some patients to be transported to a hospital.\n\n## Vaccination campaign[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: COVID-19 vaccination in the United States\nSee also: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"Memorandum From Trump's Doctor on COVID-19 Treatment\".

Some states like Texas and Arizona opted to proceed with reopening without adequate contact tracing programs in place. Health experts have expressed concerns about training and hiring enough personnel to reduce transmission. Privacy concerns have prevented measures such as those imposed in South Korea where authorities used cellphone tracking and credit card details to locate and test thousands of nightclub patrons when new cases began emerging.[205] Funding for contact tracing is thought to be insufficient, and even better-funded states have faced challenges getting in touch with contacts. Congress has allocated $631 million for state and local health surveillance programs, but the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimates that $3.6 billion will be needed. The cost rises with the number of infections, and contact tracing is easier to implement when the infection count is lower. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Washington Post Live (April 25, 2023). \"Transcript: Global Health: Lessons from the Pandemic with Philip Zelikow and Charity Dean\". *The Washington Post*.

In comparison with fully vaccinated people, the CDC found that those who were unvaccinated were from 5 to nearly 30 times more likely to become either infected or hospitalized. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare.[29][30] There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2022-05-15 |  | 74,690,082(+16,251) | 946,959(+31) |\n| 2022-05-16 |  | 74,789,428(+99,346) | 947,183(+224) |\n| 2022-05-17 |  | 74,895,446(+106,018) | 947,526(+343) |\n| 2022-05-18 |  | 75,055,651(+160,205) | 948,106(+580) |\n| 2022-05-19 |  | 75,132,281(+76,630) | 948,415(+309) |\n| 2022-05-20 |  | 75,341,674(+209,393) | 949,199(+784) |\n| 2022-05-21 |  | 75,370,367(+28,693) | 949,212(+13) |\n| 2022-05-22 |  | 75,387,266(+16,899) | 949,245(+33) |\n| 2022-05-23 |  | 75,475,425(+88,159) | 949,433(+188) |\n| 2022-05-24 |  | 75,584,406(+108,981) | 949,727(+294) |\n| 2022-05-25 |  | 75,756,923(+172,517) | 950,632(+905) |\n| 2022-05-26 |  | 75,843,978(+87,055) | 950,936(+304) |\n| 2022-05-27 |  | 75,952,031(+108,053) | 951,405(+469) |\n| 2022-05-28 |  | 75,958,574(+6,543) | 951,438(+33) |\n| 2022-05-29 |  | 75,959,894(+1,320) | 951,445(+7) |\n| 2022-05-30 |  | 75,977,949(+18,055) | 951,458(+13) |\n| 2022-05-31 |  | 76,095,745(+117,796) | 951,775(+317) |\n| 2022-06-01 |  | 76,332,257(+236,512) | 952,537(+762) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"Coronavirus (COVID-19) booster vaccine\". *NHS*.

Washington state had already required vaccines for all state employees and contractors.[315] With the new Delta variant spreading infections more quickly due to its higher transmissibility, companies including Facebook, Google, and Salesforce, have already issued employee vaccine mandates.[316]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020-04-02 |  | 241,626(+28,879) | 5,821(+1,075) |\n| 2020-04-03 |  | 274,151(+32,525) | 7,006(+1,185) |\n| 2020-04-04 |  | 307,876(+33,725) | 8,359(+1,353) |\n| 2020-04-05 |  | 333,593(+25,717) | 9,534(+1,175) |\n| 2020-04-06 |  | 362,952(+29,359) | 10,746(+1,212) |\n| 2020-04-07 |  | 393,464(+30,512) | 12,674(+1,928) |\n| 2020-04-08 |  | 425,746(+32,282) | 14,610(+1,936) |\n| 2020-04-09 |  | 459,989(+34,243) | 16,466(+1,856) |\n| 2020-04-10 |  | 493,567(+33,578) | 18,544(+2,078) |\n| 2020-04-11 |  | 525,436(+31,869) | 20,443(+1,899) |\n| 2020-04-12 |  | 553,493(+28,057) | 21,936(+1,493) |\n| 2020-04-13 |  | 578,178(+24,685) | 23,398(+1,462) |\n| 2020-04-14 |  | 604,165(+25,987) | 25,776(+2,378) |\n| 2020-04-15 |  | 633,630(+29,465) | 28,214(+2,438) |\n| 2020-04-16 |  | 665,706(+32,076) | 30,355(+2,141) |\n| 2020-04-17 |  | 696,621(+30,915) | 32,435(+2,080) |\n| 2020-04-18 |  | 724,705(+28,084) | 34,178(+1,743) |\n| 2020-04-19 |  | 750,718(+26,013) | 35,812(+1,634) |\n| 2020-04-20 |  | 775,850(+25,132) | 37,455(+1,643) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2024-05-11 |  |  | 1,159,495(+18) |\n| 2024-05-12 |  |  | 1,159,502(+7) |\n| 2024-05-13 |  |  | 1,159,522(+20) |\n| 2024-05-14 |  |  | 1,159,566(+44) |\n| 2024-05-15 |  |  | 1,159,654(+88) |\n| 2024-05-16 |  |  | 1,159,695(+41) |\n| 2024-05-17 |  |  | 1,159,785(+90) |\n| 2024-05-18 |  |  | 1,159,790(+5) |\n| 2024-05-19 |  |  | 1,159,791(+1) |\n| 2024-05-20 |  |  | 1,159,805(+14) |\n| 2024-05-21 |  |  | 1,159,809(+4) |\n| 2024-05-22 |  |  | 1,159,896(+87) |\n| 2024-05-23 |  |  | 1,159,949(+53) |\n| 2024-05-24 |  |  | 1,160,037(+88) |\n| 2024-05-25 |  |  | 1,160,045(+8) |\n| 2024-05-26 |  |  | 1,160,046(+1) |\n| 2024-05-27 |  |  | 1,160,051(+5) |\n| 2024-05-28 |  |  | 1,160,082(+31) |\n| 2024-05-29 |  |  | 1,160,281(+199) |\n| 2024-05-30 |  |  | 1,160,322(+41) |\n| 2024-05-31 |  |  | 1,160,412(+90) |\n| 2024-06-01 |  |  | 1,160,435(+23) |\n| 2024-06-02 |  |  | 1,160,439(+4) |\n| 2024-06-03 |  |  | 1,160,456(+17) |\n| 2024-06-04 |  |  | 1,160,501(+45) |\n| 2024-06-05 |  |  | 1,160,621(+120) |\n| 2024-06-06 |  |  | 1,160,662(+41) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n186. **^** Klein, Betsy; Luhby, Tami (January 11, 2023). \"Biden administration renews Covid-19 public health emergency\".

An NPR analysis of April–September 2020 data from the COVID Tracking Project found that Black people's share of COVID-19 deaths across the United States was 1.5 times greater (in some states 2.5 times greater) than their share of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanics and Latinos were disproportionately infected in 45 states and had a disproportionate share of the deaths in 19 states. Native American and Alaskan Native cases and deaths were disproportionally high in at least 21 states and, in some, as much as five times more than average. White non-Hispanics died at a lower rate than their share of the population in 36 states and D.C.[264]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2020-11-05 |  | 9,367,997(+113,498) | 222,076(+1,132) |\n|

D.C.\nThe pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, led a recession in the United States following the economic cycle peak in February 2020.[235] The economy contracted 4.8 percent from January through March 2020,[236] and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in April.[237] The total healthcare costs of treating the epidemic could be anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion according to analysis presented by *The New York Times*.[238] A study by economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson indicated that most economic impact due to consumer behavior changes was prior to mandated lockdowns.[239] During the second quarter of 2020, the U.S. economy suffered its largest drop on record, with GDP falling at an annualized rate of 32.9 percent. As of June 2020, the U.S. economy was over ten percent smaller than it was in December 2019.[240]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe U.S. government began the campaign under the presidency of Donald Trump with Operation Warp Speed, a public–private partnership to expedite the development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines.

Biden had an immediate goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses within his first hundred days in office, and signed an executive order which increased supplies for vaccination.[300][301][302] This goal was met on March 19, 2021.[303] On March 25, 2021, he announced he would increase the goal to 200 million within his first 100 days in office.[304] This goal was reached on April 21, 2021.[305]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023-04-14 |  | 93,726,905(+3,935) | 1,069,932(+271) |\n| 2023-04-15 |  | 93,726,955(+50) | 1,069,935(+3) |\n| 2023-04-16 |  | 93,727,043(+88) | 1,069,935(=) |\n| 2023-04-17 |  | 93,734,862(+7,819) | 1,070,002(+67) |\n| 2023-04-18 |  | 93,745,244(+10,382) | 1,070,157(+155) |\n| 2023-04-19 |  | 93,783,318(+38,074) | 1,070,627(+470) |\n| 2023-04-20 |  | 93,808,253(+24,935) | 1,071,074(+447) |\n| 2023-04-21 |  | 93,810,561(+2,308) | 1,071,095(+21) |\n| 2023-04-22 |  | 93,810,644(+83) | 1,071,097(+2) |\n| 2023-04-23 |  | 93,810,725(+81) | 1,071,097(=) |\n| 2023-04-24 |  | 93,816,049(+5,324) | 1,071,172(+75) |\n| 2023-04-25 |  | 93,822,797(+6,748) | 1,071,348(+176) |\n| 2023-04-26 |  | 93,862,886(+40,089) | 1,071,746(+398) |\n| 2023-04-27 |  | 93,885,020(+22,134) | 1,072,105(+359) |\n| 2023-04-28 |  | 93,890,984(+5,964) | 1,072,559(+454) |\n| 2023-04-29 |  | 93,891,195(+211) | 1,072,561(+2) |\n| 2023-04-30 |  | 93,891,276(+81) | 1,072,561(=) |\n| 2023-05-01 |  | 93,894,961(+3,685) | 1,072,630(+69) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n285. **^** Greenberger LM, Saltzman LA, Senefeld JW, Johnson PW, DeGennaro LJ, Nichols GL (August 2021). \"Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with hematologic malignancies\". *Cancer Cell*. **39** (8): 1031–1033. doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2021.07.012.

following vaccination are still not getting sick and not dying like was happening before vaccination.\"[278] By late August 2021, the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of U.S. cases and was found to double the risk of severe illness and hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.[279]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a study by the ECDC estimated that 470,000 lives over the age of 60 had been saved since the start of the vaccination roll-out in the European region.[280]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the United States, remdesivir is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb)) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.[208] The FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the combination of baricitinib with remdesivir, for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in hospitalized people two years of age or older requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).[209] In early March, President Trump directed the FDA to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients.[210] Among those were chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been successfully used to treat malaria for over fifty years. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported by CNN that COVID-19 numbers reached pandemic lows across the US, resulting in many testing sites closing their doors. With testing sites seeing as low as single digits per day, Director of Public Health Services Division of the Haywood County Health and Human Services Agency in North Carolina Sarah Henderson suggested that she expected most counties to see closures soon, if they hadn't already. \"We were seeing an excess of 100 patients at our testing site in the first few days [of January], which doesn't sound like a lot, but our community is very small,\" Henderson said. \"The last couple of weeks, we have seen single digits every day. I certainly won't speak for other counties, but I think we're probably heading in that direction where if they're not closing down, they're decreasing hours and staff.\"[164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2022-02-15 |  | 70,828,575(+87,360) | 874,755(+2,370) |\n| 2022-02-16 |  | 70,971,781(+143,206) | 878,289(+3,534) |\n| 2022-02-17 |  | 71,050,716(+78,935) | 880,328(+2,039) |\n| 2022-02-18 |  | 71,180,629(+129,913) | 883,741(+3,413) |\n| 2022-02-19 |  | 71,207,823(+27,194) | 884,368(+627) |\n| 2022-02-20 |  | 71,220,709(+12,886) | 884,619(+251) |\n| 2022-02-21 |  | 71,262,880(+42,171) | 885,237(+618) |\n| 2022-02-22 |  | 71,372,578(+109,698) | 888,036(+2,799) |\n| 2022-02-23 |  | 71,461,606(+89,028) | 891,405(+3,369) |\n| 2022-02-24 |  | 71,512,874(+51,268) | 893,514(+2,109) |\n| 2022-02-25 |  | 71,602,022(+89,148) | 896,477(+2,963) |\n| 2022-02-26 |  | 71,618,021(+15,999) | 896,914(+437) |\n| 2022-02-27 |  | 71,624,034(+6,013) | 897,008(+94) |\n| 2022-02-28 |  | 71,701,306(+77,272) | 898,938(+1,930) |\n| 2022-03-01 |  | 71,735,729(+34,423) | 900,506(+1,568) |\n| 2022-03-02 |  | 71,794,005(+58,276) | 902,786(+2,280) |\n| 2022-03-03 |  | 71,850,206(+56,201) | 904,037(+1,251) |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_RrKvssyHfm6ePZV2jkQIC6vf","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020.

Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **21 January:** Research from the University of São Paulo and the Conectas Direitos Humanos [pt] revealed the \"existence of an institutional strategy to spread the virus, promoted by the Brazilian Government under the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic\".[100][101]![](image)Pharmaceutical company União Quimica started production of Sputnik V vaccine in Brazil in January 2021\n* **27 January:** Brazil reaches 220,000 deaths.[102] *The Lancet* publishes an article concerning the possible causes of an \"unexpected\" increase in January hospital admissions in Manaus, including the emergence of the P.1. variant.

On 12 March, the Ministry of Health requested an additional R$10 billion (US$2.1 billion) to the federal budget as part of its efforts to manage the pandemic.[238] It estimated that 2,000 intensive care units would be immediately needed.[239]\n\n\nOn 18 March 2020 hospitals in São Paulo denounced a lack of health materials, such as masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, caused by an increase in prices.[240][241] According to them, packages of masks went from R$4.50 in January to R$140 by 17 March. The government said it will negotiate with industry to meet the demand.[242][243]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 19 March 2020 scientists predicted up to 2 million deaths in Brazil in the worst-case scenario, without measures to contain the coronavirus. They pointed out that maintaining social distance was one of the most effective measures in the absence of a vaccine.[156] Their conclusion came after analyzing the growth curve of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The contagion rate was the same as that registered in Italy, as the number of infected people had been doubling every 54 hours. According to estimates, the number of confirmed cases might reach 3,000 by 24 March.[157] According to the Ministry of Health, the number of infected patients would grow exponentially until the end of June.[160] The mayor of Belo Horizonte, Alexandre Kalil (PSD), asked General Altair José Polsin, commander of the 4th Army Region, for the temporary assignment of 51 professionals from the army garrison to assist in the demands of fighting the coronavirus. The Brazilian Army has not yet said whether it will meet this demand. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Instituto Butantan imported the first 6 million doses of CoronaVac in a collaboration with the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.[149]\n\n\nThere is no deadline forecast for immunizing the country's entire population due to the lack of supplies for vaccine production[150] and also due to political disputes between the São Paulo state government and the Jair Bolsonaro government.[151][152][153]\n\n\n\nAccording to a June 2022 study published in *The Lancet*, COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil prevented an additional 1 million deaths from December 8, 2020, to December 8, 2021.[154][155]\n\n## Responses[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific research and forecast[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 March 2020, scientists predicted up to 2 million deaths in Brazil in the worst-case scenario without measures to contain the virus.

Wajngarten had also interacted with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence during Bolsonaro's visit to Miami, Florida on 7 March.[36] The number of cases within the cabinet began to increase, including Minister of Mines and Energy Bento Albuquerque, and President of the Federal Senate Davi Alcolumbre; by 20 March, Brazil had the second-largest number of cases among members of a federal cabinet, overtaking Iran and behind only France.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **1 April:** Prostitutes in Minas Gerais go on strike to pressure the Ministry of Health into classifying sex workers as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccines.

suffered from a lack of water. Without water to clean themselves, this made them vulnerable to the proliferation of coronavirus. Water did not reach parts of the Baixada Fluminense and the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro. Among the affected areas are the Chatuba de Mesquita, Camarista, Méier and Complexo do Alemão communities. The infectious disease doctor and pediatrician Cristiana Meirelles said that without clean running water, the situation of fighting the epidemic would become catastrophic.[234]\nCufa (*Central Única das Favelas*, a NGO that operates with Favelas) called for measures to contain coronavirus in favelas. Government actions did not include the economically fragile, a contingent that totals more than 70 million people, said the organization.[235]\n\n\nSome areas of Maré had been without water for two days, and other areas were reported to have been without water for two weeks.[236][237]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"Site do Ministério da Saúde sofre ataque hacker durante madrugada e sai do ar\". *CNN Brasil* (in Brazilian Portuguese).

Subsequent samplings are positive on 11 December 2019 and 20 February 2020.

Thus, it is highly unlikely that it was circulating in Brazil before early 2020.[19] Researchers from the Institute of Tropical Medicine and international colleagues showed in the scientific journal Science that the first sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil occurred between late February and early March 2020.[20]\n\n\n### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **21 January:** Research from the University of São Paulo and the Conectas Direitos Humanos [pt] revealed the \"existence of an institutional strategy to spread the virus, promoted by the Brazilian Government under the leadership of the Presidency of the Republic\".[100][101]![](image)Pharmaceutical company União Quimica started production of Sputnik V vaccine in Brazil in January 2021\n* **27 January:** Brazil reaches 220,000 deaths.[102] *The Lancet* publishes an article concerning the possible causes of an \"unexpected\" increase in January hospital admissions in Manaus, including the emergence of the P.1. variant.

However, President Jair Bolsonaro announced few country-wide measures to slow the spread of the virus,[226][227] and because the federal government decided not to cancel classes in the whole country, lower levels of government have done so on independently. Municipal, state, and private schools and universities had different reactions regarding the suspension of classes. Classes were suspended at once, gradually or not at all. Some of them were replaced with distance education or simply postponed. Because of that, there are only \"localized\" (as opposed to \"national\") school closures, according to UNESCO.[228]\n\n\n\n### Employment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n218. **^** \"Sesc Minas emite nota sobre fechamento do Sesc Mineiro de Grussaí – Portal Ururau – Site de Notícias – Campos dos Goytacazes\". 9 May 2020.

On 12 March, the Ministry of Health requested an additional R$10 billion (US$2.1 billion) to the federal budget as part of its efforts to manage the pandemic.[238] It estimated that 2,000 intensive care units would be immediately needed.[239]\n\n\nOn 18 March 2020 hospitals in São Paulo denounced a lack of health materials, such as masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, caused by an increase in prices.[240][241] According to them, packages of masks went from R$4.50 in January to R$140 by 17 March. The government said it will negotiate with industry to meet the demand.[242][243]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 19 March 2020 scientists predicted up to 2 million deaths in Brazil in the worst-case scenario, without measures to contain the coronavirus. They pointed out that maintaining social distance was one of the most effective measures in the absence of a vaccine.[156] Their conclusion came after analyzing the growth curve of COVID-19 cases in Brazil. The contagion rate was the same as that registered in Italy, as the number of infected people had been doubling every 54 hours. According to estimates, the number of confirmed cases might reach 3,000 by 24 March.[157] According to the Ministry of Health, the number of infected patients would grow exponentially until the end of June.[160] The mayor of Belo Horizonte, Alexandre Kalil (PSD), asked General Altair José Polsin, commander of the 4th Army Region, for the temporary assignment of 51 professionals from the army garrison to assist in the demands of fighting the coronavirus. The Brazilian Army has not yet said whether it will meet this demand. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Instituto Butantan imported the first 6 million doses of CoronaVac in a collaboration with the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.[149]\n\n\nThere is no deadline forecast for immunizing the country's entire population due to the lack of supplies for vaccine production[150] and also due to political disputes between the São Paulo state government and the Jair Bolsonaro government.[151][152][153]\n\n\n\nAccording to a June 2022 study published in *The Lancet*, COVID-19 vaccination in Brazil prevented an additional 1 million deaths from December 8, 2020, to December 8, 2021.[154][155]\n\n## Responses[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific research and forecast[edit]\n\n\nOn 19 March 2020, scientists predicted up to 2 million deaths in Brazil in the worst-case scenario without measures to contain the virus.

Some patients died of asphyxiation,[93] and some were transferred to other states. The city implemented an overnight curfew.[94][95] Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza, on instructions from Nicolás Maduro, offered his country's oxygen stock to the government of Amazonas.[96] It was later revealed that Brazilian officials had been warned of the oxygen supply crisis six days earlier.[97]\n* **17 January:** Anvisa has authorized the emergency use of CoronaVac and the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine.[98] Monica Calazans, 54 years old and part of the risk group, a nurse in the fight against COVID, became the first Brazilian to take CoronaVac officially outside the tests.[99]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 12 March, it was reported that Bolsonaro's press secretary Fábio Wajngarten had tested positive for COVID-19, prompting increased monitoring of Bolsonaro (who tested negative the next day)[34][35] and his cabinet. Wajngarten had also interacted with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence during Bolsonaro's visit to Miami, Florida on 7 March.[36] The number of cases within the cabinet began to increase, including Minister of Mines and Energy Bento Albuquerque, and President of the Federal Senate Davi Alcolumbre; by 20 March, Brazil had the second-largest number of cases among members of a federal cabinet, overtaking Iran and behind only France.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **1 April:** Prostitutes in Minas Gerais go on strike to pressure the Ministry of Health into classifying sex workers as a priority group for COVID-19 vaccines.

suffered from a lack of water. Without water to clean themselves, this made them vulnerable to the proliferation of coronavirus. Water did not reach parts of the Baixada Fluminense and the North Zone of Rio de Janeiro. Among the affected areas are the Chatuba de Mesquita, Camarista, Méier and Complexo do Alemão communities. The infectious disease doctor and pediatrician Cristiana Meirelles said that without clean running water, the situation of fighting the epidemic would become catastrophic.[234]\nCufa (*Central Única das Favelas*, a NGO that operates with Favelas) called for measures to contain coronavirus in favelas. Government actions did not include the economically fragile, a contingent that totals more than 70 million people, said the organization.[235]\n\n\nSome areas of Maré had been without water for two days, and other areas were reported to have been without water for two weeks.[236][237]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"Site do Ministério da Saúde sofre ataque hacker durante madrugada e sai do ar\". *CNN Brasil* (in Brazilian Portuguese).

On 5 March 2020, French authorities confiscated four million masks from the Swedish health care company Mölnlycke, which were in a distribution centre in Lyon and destined for Spain and Italy. Two weeks later, after pressure from the Swedish government, France released the masks, allowing two million of them through, with the rest remaining in France either to be used there or for re-export.[254] Mölnlycke estimated that a total of \"six million masks were seized by the French. All had been contracted for, including a million masks each for France, Italy and Spain. The rest were destined for Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland.\"[255]\n\n\nOn 27 April 2020, it was revealed by Libération that, contrary to government claims in March, a change of doctrine was not the main cause of the mask shortage, and that the government had been fully informed as early as 2018 that strategic reserves were depleted.[256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLegend\n1.

The agency banned its use, even with prescriptions, outside of hospitals, and in clinical trials, while stepping up its surveillance.[264]\n\n\nRaoult later resigned from the committee, and defended chloroquine as a drug that has been safely used for 80 years.[96]\n\n\nOn 3 December 2021, the Order of Physicians in France gave Raoult a blame for promoting hydroxychloroquine \"without scientific data\".[265]\n\n\n\n## Chinese Embassy article[edit]\n\n\nSee also: China–France relations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2021-11-06 |  | 7,208,937(+9,605) | 117,900(+25) |\n| 2021-11-07 |  | 7,217,484(+8,547) | 117,910(+10) |\n| 2021-11-08 |  | 7,219,681(+2,197) | 117,965(+55) |\n| 2021-11-09 |  | 7,232,157(+12,476) | 118,023(+58) |\n| 2021-11-10 |  | 7,244,040(+11,883) | 118,056(+33) |\n| 2021-11-11 |  | 7,256,643(+12,603) | 118,073(+17) |\n| 2021-11-12 |  | 7,260,503(+3,860) | 118,121(+48) |\n| 2021-11-13 |  | 7,275,149(+14,646) | 118,137(+16) |\n| 2021-11-14 |  | 7,287,645(+12,496) | 118,154(+17) |\n| 2021-11-15 |  | 7,290,886(+3,241) | 118,224(+70) |\n| 2021-11-16 |  | 7,310,664(+19,778) | 118,271(+47) |\n| 2021-11-17 |  | 7,330,958(+20,294) | 118,321(+50) |\n| 2021-11-18 |  | 7,351,324(+20,366) | 118,373(+52) |\n| 2021-11-19 |  | 7,372,544(+21,220) | 118,423(+50) |\n| 2021-11-20 |  | 7,395,222(+22,678) | 118,446(+23) |\n| 2021-11-21 |  | 7,414,971(+19,749) | 118,461(+15) |\n| 2021-11-22 |  | 7,420,237(+5,266) | 118,555(+94) |\n| 2021-11-23 |  | 7,450,691(+30,454) | 118,653(+98) |\n| 2021-11-24 |  | 7,483,282(+32,591) | 118,705(+52) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n143. **^** \"Décret #2020-1582 du 14 décembre 2020 modifiant les décrets #2020-1262 du 16 octobre 2020 et #2020-1310 du 29 octobre 2020 prescrivant les mesures générales nécessaires pour faire face à l'épidémie de covid-19 dans le cadre de l'état d'urgence sanitaire\"..\n144. **^** \"Décret #2021–31 du 15 janvier 2021 modifiant les décrets #2020-1262 du 16 octobre 2020 et #2020-1310 du 29 octobre 2020 prescrivant les mesures générales nécessaires pour faire face à l'épidémie de covid-19 dans le cadre de l'état d'urgence sanitaire\"..\n145. **^** \"Décret #2021–99 du 30 janvier 2021 modifiant les décrets #2020-1262 du 16 octobre 2020 et #2020-1310 du 29 octobre 2020 prescrivant les mesures générales nécessaires pour faire face à l'épidémie de covid-19 dans le cadre de l'état d'urgence sanitaire\"..\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 28 September 2020, according to an Amnesty International report French authorities wrongly punished thousands of peaceful protesters under draconian laws in pre and post COVID-19 crackdowns.

Both were Chinese nationals.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRussia has the tenth-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, after the United States, India, France, Brazil, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan. According to detailed data published by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), 114,268 people with COVID-19 died between April and November 2020.[5][6] However, over 300,000 excess deaths[7] were reported in the same time period, suggesting that the official pandemic death tally greatly underestimated the true number of COVID-19 related deaths.[8][9]\n\n\nAnalysis of excess deaths from official government demographic statistics, based on births and deaths and excluding migration, showed that Russia had its biggest ever annual population drop in peacetime, with the population declining by 997,000 between October 2020 and September 2021, which demographer Alexei Raksha interpreted as being primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * National Cabinet (Australia)\n* ScienceUpFirst (Canada)\n* Wuhan Institute of Virology (China)\n* Independent SAGE (United Kingdom)\n |\n| Healthinstitutes | * Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (African Union)\n* Ghana Infectious Disease Centre (Ghana)\n* Department of Health (Hong Kong)\n* Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (South Korea)\n* National Institute for Communicable Diseases (South Africa)\n* Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan)\n |\n| Pandemicinstitutes | * National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board (Australia)\n* COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (Canada)\n* COVID-19 Supply Council (Canada)\n* PREPARE (European Union)\n* National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (India)\n* COVID-19 Response Acceleration Task Force (Indonesia)\n* National Public Health Emergency Team (Ireland)\n* Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting (Japan)\n* Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (Malaysia)\n* Defeat COVID-19 Ad Hoc Committee (Philippines)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia\n\nThe official national statistics include data by region.

Early prevention measures included restricting the China–Russia border and extensive testing. The infection spread from Italy on 2 March, leading to additional measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres, and museums, as well as shutting the border and declaring a non-working period which, after two extensions, lasted until 11 May 2020. By the end of March 2020, COVID-19 lockdowns were imposed by the majority of federal subjects of Russia, including Moscow. By 17 April 2020, cases had been confirmed in all federal subjects.

On 2 April, the measures were announced in Amur Oblast (for those over 65), Tyumen Oblast,[114] and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.[115] On 3 April, the measures were announced in Oryol Oblast[116] and Tula Oblast (for those over 65).[117]\n\n\n\n### Vaccination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 vaccination in Russia\n\nMass vaccinations began in December 2020, starting with primarily doctors, medical workers and teachers. Vaccinations began in Moscow on 5 December and were expanded to all other regions by 15 December.[118][119][120] In January 2021, the vaccination programme was extended to the entire population.[121]\n\n\nAs of 20 July 2021, 33.19 million people have received at least one dose, with 21.6 million people fully vaccinated.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n## Impacts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe said that the situation had changed compared to the beginning of the year as well as the understanding of the virus, and attributed the rise in cases to the seasonality of the virus.[78] On 29 September, the Chairman of the State Duma, Volodin, said that 18 deputies were in the hospital with the virus and that overall 60 deputies have been ill. The State Duma would also partially switch to working remotely.[79]\n\n\n\n### October–December 2020[edit]\n\n\nOn 2 October, it was published that in total, more than 45,000 people had died to date with coronavirus in Russia. The fatality rate in Russia was 4.6% at the end of August 2020.[80] On 4 October there were confirmed 10,499 and it was the highest number since May 2020.[81] 13,634 were confirmed on 11 October.[81] 15,150 were confirmed on 15 October and it was the highest number since the pandemic started. Also daily deaths have steadily been increasing. There are now 23,723 deaths in the country.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe patients were 73 and 88 years old and had tested positive for the coronavirus.[31] On 25 March, President Putin announced that the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum would be postponed due to the epidemic.[32] He said that the next week starting on 30 March would be non-working nationwide and urged Russians to stay at home.[33][34] Later, the non-working period was prolonged twice, lasting until 11 May.[35][36] On 27 March, international flights were grounded after the government ordered the civil aviation authority to suspend all regular and charter flights to and from the country.[37] On 29 March, Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin issued a stay-at-home order starting the next day.[38] On 30 March, similar orders or recommendations were announced in numerous other federal jurisdictions, with many more announcing such restrictions over the next few days.[39] The same day, the border was shut, with all border crossings closed.[40]\n\n\n\n### April–June 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe government of Russia initially responded to the pandemic with preventive measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, which involved imposing quarantines, carrying raids on potential virus carriers, and using facial recognition to impose quarantine measures.[86] Measures to prevent a crisis in Russia include banning the export of medical masks, random checks on the Moscow Metro, and cancellation of large-scale events by schools. The Russian government has also taken measures to prevent foreign citizens from heavily affected countries from visiting Russia.[*citation needed*] Local governments have also responded to the pandemic by imposing their own preventive measures in their communities.\n\n\n\n### Lockdowns[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of federal subjects that have announced the \"self-isolation regime\".

Self-isolation rules and travel permits would be waived on 9 June, with no more walking schedules. Residents would be able to freely travel around the city and visit public places. Places like beauty salons, hairdressers and veterinarian clinics would re-open, with other places like restaurants re-opening over the course of June. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn May 2020, as Russia's mortality rate was much lower compared to other hard-hit countries, a number of media outlets including the Financial Times and New York Times said that the number of deaths in the country may have been under-reported, based on a spike in mortality rates officially reported in Moscow where approximately 1,800 more deaths were registered in April compared to the monthly average, while the Financial Times noted a similar surge in St. Petersburg, concluding that there could be around 70% more deaths than reported.[187] The reported excess deaths were considerably smaller compared to other hard-hit areas in other countries.[188] Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the reports \"disinformation\" and said that letters demanding a retraction would be sent.

Anastasia Vasilyeva, leader of the Doctors' Alliance organisation loosely aligned to the Russian opposition and doctor for opposition figure Alexei Navalny, made a series of videos accusing the authorities of concealing the true number of coronavirus cases by using pneumonia and acute respiratory infection as a diagnosis instead.

decree introducing a digital pass system to enforce the coronavirus lockdown. Residents would require such a permit to travel around the city and Moscow Oblast using personal and public transport, with different types of passes including travelling to work, visiting hospitals and clinics, and private trips. Such permits would become mandatory on 15 April.[41] On 29 April, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said on social media that the city would start constructing temporary hospitals that would have a total of 10,000 hospital beds for coronavirus patients.[42] Russia also indefinitely extended its entry ban for foreigners, which was originally set until 1 May, with Prime Minister Mishustin saying that the ban will be lifted when the coronavirus situation improved.[43] On 30 April, Prime Minister Mishustin said that he tested positive for the virus.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023-04-04 |

Both were Chinese nationals.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRussia has the tenth-highest number of confirmed cases in the world, after the United States, India, France, Brazil, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan. According to detailed data published by the Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), 114,268 people with COVID-19 died between April and November 2020.[5][6] However, over 300,000 excess deaths[7] were reported in the same time period, suggesting that the official pandemic death tally greatly underestimated the true number of COVID-19 related deaths.[8][9]\n\n\nAnalysis of excess deaths from official government demographic statistics, based on births and deaths and excluding migration, showed that Russia had its biggest ever annual population drop in peacetime, with the population declining by 997,000 between October 2020 and September 2021, which demographer Alexei Raksha interpreted as being primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * National Cabinet (Australia)\n* ScienceUpFirst (Canada)\n* Wuhan Institute of Virology (China)\n* Independent SAGE (United Kingdom)\n |\n| Healthinstitutes | * Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (African Union)\n* Ghana Infectious Disease Centre (Ghana)\n* Department of Health (Hong Kong)\n* Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (South Korea)\n* National Institute for Communicable Diseases (South Africa)\n* Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan)\n |\n| Pandemicinstitutes | * National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board (Australia)\n* COVID-19 Immunity Task Force (Canada)\n* COVID-19 Supply Council (Canada)\n* PREPARE (European Union)\n* National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (India)\n* COVID-19 Response Acceleration Task Force (Indonesia)\n* National Public Health Emergency Team (Ireland)\n* Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting (Japan)\n* Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre (Malaysia)\n* Defeat COVID-19 Ad Hoc Committee (Philippines)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia\n\nThe official national statistics include data by region.

Early prevention measures included restricting the China–Russia border and extensive testing. The infection spread from Italy on 2 March, leading to additional measures such as cancelling events, closing schools, theatres, and museums, as well as shutting the border and declaring a non-working period which, after two extensions, lasted until 11 May 2020. By the end of March 2020, COVID-19 lockdowns were imposed by the majority of federal subjects of Russia, including Moscow. By 17 April 2020, cases had been confirmed in all federal subjects.

On 2 April, the measures were announced in Amur Oblast (for those over 65), Tyumen Oblast,[114] and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.[115] On 3 April, the measures were announced in Oryol Oblast[116] and Tula Oblast (for those over 65).[117]\n\n\n\n### Vaccination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: COVID-19 vaccination in Russia\n\nMass vaccinations began in December 2020, starting with primarily doctors, medical workers and teachers. Vaccinations began in Moscow on 5 December and were expanded to all other regions by 15 December.[118][119][120] In January 2021, the vaccination programme was extended to the entire population.[121]\n\n\nAs of 20 July 2021, 33.19 million people have received at least one dose, with 21.6 million people fully vaccinated.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n## Impacts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nShe said that the situation had changed compared to the beginning of the year as well as the understanding of the virus, and attributed the rise in cases to the seasonality of the virus.[78] On 29 September, the Chairman of the State Duma, Volodin, said that 18 deputies were in the hospital with the virus and that overall 60 deputies have been ill. The State Duma would also partially switch to working remotely.[79]\n\n\n\n### October–December 2020[edit]\n\n\nOn 2 October, it was published that in total, more than 45,000 people had died to date with coronavirus in Russia. The fatality rate in Russia was 4.6% at the end of August 2020.[80] On 4 October there were confirmed 10,499 and it was the highest number since May 2020.[81] 13,634 were confirmed on 11 October.[81] 15,150 were confirmed on 15 October and it was the highest number since the pandemic started. Also daily deaths have steadily been increasing. There are now 23,723 deaths in the country.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe patients were 73 and 88 years old and had tested positive for the coronavirus.[31] On 25 March, President Putin announced that the 2020 Russian constitutional referendum would be postponed due to the epidemic.[32] He said that the next week starting on 30 March would be non-working nationwide and urged Russians to stay at home.[33][34] Later, the non-working period was prolonged twice, lasting until 11 May.[35][36] On 27 March, international flights were grounded after the government ordered the civil aviation authority to suspend all regular and charter flights to and from the country.[37] On 29 March, Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin issued a stay-at-home order starting the next day.[38] On 30 March, similar orders or recommendations were announced in numerous other federal jurisdictions, with many more announcing such restrictions over the next few days.[39] The same day, the border was shut, with all border crossings closed.[40]\n\n\n\n### April–June 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe government of Russia initially responded to the pandemic with preventive measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, which involved imposing quarantines, carrying raids on potential virus carriers, and using facial recognition to impose quarantine measures.[86] Measures to prevent a crisis in Russia include banning the export of medical masks, random checks on the Moscow Metro, and cancellation of large-scale events by schools. The Russian government has also taken measures to prevent foreign citizens from heavily affected countries from visiting Russia.[*citation needed*] Local governments have also responded to the pandemic by imposing their own preventive measures in their communities.\n\n\n\n### Lockdowns[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of federal subjects that have announced the \"self-isolation regime\".

Self-isolation rules and travel permits would be waived on 9 June, with no more walking schedules. Residents would be able to freely travel around the city and visit public places. Places like beauty salons, hairdressers and veterinarian clinics would re-open, with other places like restaurants re-opening over the course of June. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn May 2020, as Russia's mortality rate was much lower compared to other hard-hit countries, a number of media outlets including the Financial Times and New York Times said that the number of deaths in the country may have been under-reported, based on a spike in mortality rates officially reported in Moscow where approximately 1,800 more deaths were registered in April compared to the monthly average, while the Financial Times noted a similar surge in St. Petersburg, concluding that there could be around 70% more deaths than reported.[187] The reported excess deaths were considerably smaller compared to other hard-hit areas in other countries.[188] Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the reports \"disinformation\" and said that letters demanding a retraction would be sent.

Anastasia Vasilyeva, leader of the Doctors' Alliance organisation loosely aligned to the Russian opposition and doctor for opposition figure Alexei Navalny, made a series of videos accusing the authorities of concealing the true number of coronavirus cases by using pneumonia and acute respiratory infection as a diagnosis instead.

decree introducing a digital pass system to enforce the coronavirus lockdown. Residents would require such a permit to travel around the city and Moscow Oblast using personal and public transport, with different types of passes including travelling to work, visiting hospitals and clinics, and private trips. Such permits would become mandatory on 15 April.[41] On 29 April, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said on social media that the city would start constructing temporary hospitals that would have a total of 10,000 hospital beds for coronavirus patients.[42] Russia also indefinitely extended its entry ban for foreigners, which was originally set until 1 May, with Prime Minister Mishustin saying that the ban will be lifted when the coronavirus situation improved.[43] On 30 April, Prime Minister Mishustin said that he tested positive for the virus.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023-04-04 |
