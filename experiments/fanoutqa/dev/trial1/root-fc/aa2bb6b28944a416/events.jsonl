Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

In 1718, Elihu Yale sold a portion of his collection of gems and furniture to provide an initial fund of £562 for the establishment of the school's endowment.[5] From 1985 until 2021, the Chief Investment Officer of Yale was alumnus David Swensen, who was replaced by alumnus Matthew Mendelsohn.[2][3] As of 2013, the chairman of the Yale Investment Committee, which provides oversight of the endowment, was Douglas A. Warner III.[6]\n\n\n\n## Investments and performance[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.[1] Since the early 1990s, the endowment has generated annual returns for the university of approximately 11.3 percent, with a portion of the annual return forming part of the university's operating budget and the remainder reinvested to grow the size of the endowment.[7] Spending from revenue earned off the endowment accounted for $1.2 billion of the university's operating budget in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2021.[7][1] The university aims to spend approximately 5.25 percent of the endowment on its annual operating budget.[1]\n\n\nThe endowment has become known for seeking out \"unconventional assets\" and for investments in emerging businesses.[8] In the 1990s it invested in Google and Amazon and was later an early investor in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.[8] As of 2016, its venture capital investments had averaged 93-percent returns over the preceding two decades.[9]\n\n\n\n## Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the State of Connecticut considered taxing Yale's investment returns as a way of plugging a gap in the state budget.[10] The university objected, in part, on the grounds that such a move would be a violation of the tax exemption guaranteed to the university by the Colony of Connecticut in 1745.[10][11]\n\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, some criticized the size of compensation given to the endowment's managers.[12] In 2015, Swenson earned $4.5 million, making him the highest-paid employee at the university, surpassing the compensation of even university president Peter Salovey.[12][13] Others have said the salaries of endowment managers are justifiable, asserting that they are less than what could be earned in the private sector and pay for themselves with the endowment's high rates of return.[12]\n\n\nYale's endowment has been widely criticized for its investments in fossil fuel companies, Puerto Rican debt, private prisons, companies which provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, subprime mortgage lending companies, and for other controversial holdings. In December 2018, after years of criticism from campus fossil fuel divestment groups, Yale University arrested 48 student activists for staging a sit-in at the Yale Investment Office to protest Yale’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry and Puerto Rican debt.[14] That same quarter Yale sold 99 percent of its direct investment holdings in Antero Resource Corporation, a natural gas and oil company, according to Yale’s 2018 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Yale endowment earns 40.2% investment return in fiscal 2021\". *YaleNews*. 2021-10-14.

In 1718, Elihu Yale sold a portion of his collection of gems and furniture to provide an initial fund of £562 for the establishment of the school's endowment.[5] From 1985 until 2021, the Chief Investment Officer of Yale was alumnus David Swensen, who was replaced by alumnus Matthew Mendelsohn.[2][3] As of 2013, the chairman of the Yale Investment Committee, which provides oversight of the endowment, was Douglas A. Warner III.[6]\n\n\n\n## Investments and performance[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 30, 2021, the endowment was valued at $42.3 billion.[1] Since the early 1990s, the endowment has generated annual returns for the university of approximately 11.3 percent, with a portion of the annual return forming part of the university's operating budget and the remainder reinvested to grow the size of the endowment.[7] Spending from revenue earned off the endowment accounted for $1.2 billion of the university's operating budget in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2021.[7][1] The university aims to spend approximately 5.25 percent of the endowment on its annual operating budget.[1]\n\n\nThe endowment has become known for seeking out \"unconventional assets\" and for investments in emerging businesses.[8] In the 1990s it invested in Google and Amazon and was later an early investor in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Airbnb.[8] As of 2016, its venture capital investments had averaged 93-percent returns over the preceding two decades.[9]\n\n\n\n## Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 the State of Connecticut considered taxing Yale's investment returns as a way of plugging a gap in the state budget.[10] The university objected, in part, on the grounds that such a move would be a violation of the tax exemption guaranteed to the university by the Colony of Connecticut in 1745.[10][11]\n\n\nBeginning in the early 2000s, some criticized the size of compensation given to the endowment's managers.[12] In 2015, Swenson earned $4.5 million, making him the highest-paid employee at the university, surpassing the compensation of even university president Peter Salovey.[12][13] Others have said the salaries of endowment managers are justifiable, asserting that they are less than what could be earned in the private sector and pay for themselves with the endowment's high rates of return.[12]\n\n\nYale's endowment has been widely criticized for its investments in fossil fuel companies, Puerto Rican debt, private prisons, companies which provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, subprime mortgage lending companies, and for other controversial holdings. In December 2018, after years of criticism from campus fossil fuel divestment groups, Yale University arrested 48 student activists for staging a sit-in at the Yale Investment Office to protest Yale’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry and Puerto Rican debt.[14] That same quarter Yale sold 99 percent of its direct investment holdings in Antero Resource Corporation, a natural gas and oil company, according to Yale’s 2018 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Yale endowment earns 40.2% investment return in fiscal 2021\". *YaleNews*. 2021-10-14.

The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1 billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1 billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1 billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1 billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

The campus occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students.[14] Stanford has been considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[a]\n\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford—a railroad magnate who served as the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California—and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever aged 15 the previous year.[2] The university admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\nThe university is organized around seven schools on the same campus: three schools consisting of 45 academic departments at the undergraduate level, as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The university also houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think-tank. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[17] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[18] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[19]\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 58 Nobel laureates, 29 Turing Award laureates,[note 1] and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty, or staff.[40] In addition, Stanford is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups.[41][42][43][44][45] Stanford alumni have founded numerous companies, which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue.[46][47][48] Stanford is the alma mater of U.S. President Herbert Hoover, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, 74 living billionaires, and 17 astronauts.[49] In academia, its alumni include the presidents and provosts of Yale, Harvard and Princeton. It is also one of the leading producers of Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.[50]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of the Stanford family on the Stanford University campus\n![](image)Center of the campus in 1891[51]\n![](image)Ichthyologist and founding president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan\nMain article: History of Stanford University\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr., their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, the Stanfords, particularly Jane, wanted their university to look different from the eastern ones, which had often sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant[53] that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" This guides the campus buildings to this day. The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.[54]\n\n\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.[55][56] The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored.[57]\n\n\nDuring the early-twentieth century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco;[58] it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.[59] The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923.[60] The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.[61] The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover.[62] In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Shockley, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate in physics, \"Father of Silicon Valley\"\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.[64] During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.[65] Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors.[66] Shockley and Terman are often described, separately or jointly, as the \"fathers of Silicon Valley\".[67][68]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.[69] Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL.[70][71]\n\n\nWallace Sterling was president 1949 to 1968. He oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, \"the Harvard of the West\".[72]\n\n\nAchievements during Sterling's tenure included:\n\n\n\n* Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.\n* Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university's finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university's aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.\n* Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.\n* Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.\n* Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.\n* Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.\n* Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.\n\n\nIn 2022, Stanford University issued a public apology for its discrimination against Jewish applicants in the 1950s, which was documented through internal memos involving Sterling.[73]\nIn the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, \"when it appeared on lists of the \"top ten\" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\"[74] Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\",[75] but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical,[76] and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding[77][78] and the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.[79]\n\n\n\n## Land[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The center of the Stanford University campus\nMost of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[6] campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2] It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose. $4.5 billion was received by Stanford in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[82]\n\n\nStanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County,[83] although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[84]\n\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the main quadrangle of Stanford with Memorial Church in the center background from across the grass-covered Oval\n\n\n### Non-central campus[edit]\n\n\nStanford currently operates in several locations beyond its central campus.\n\n\nOn the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. Researchers and students are involved in biological research. Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community. The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.[89]\n* SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on 426 acres (172 ha) of land.[90]\n\n\nOff the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892. Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories. It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes.[91] A graduate student of the anthropology department discover some broken elements, which leads to proof that 100 years before it was home to a Chinese American fishing village.[92]\n* Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a \"mini-Stanford.\"[93]\n* Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by The Great Recession.[94][95] In 2015 the university announced a development plan[96] and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.[97]\n* The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates.[98] It includes a small art gallery open to the public.[99]\n* China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.[100][101]\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Lagunita in winter; the Dish, a large radio telescope, and local landmark, is visible in the Stanford-owned foothills behind the lake and is the high point of a popular campus jogging and walking trail.\n\n\n### Faculty residences[edit]\n\n\nMany Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[102] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.[103]\n\n\n\n### Other uses[edit]\n\n\nSome of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[104] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.[105] Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course[106] and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center[107] used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nContemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as \"The Claw\") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of \"fountain hopping\"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[108][109][110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Interior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad](image)\n\nInterior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad\n* ![Hoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus](image)\n\nHoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus\n* ![The new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games](image)\n\nThe new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games\n* ![Stanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background](image)\n\nStanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background\n* ![The Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus](image)\n\nThe Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus\n* ![White Memorial Fountain (The Claw)](image)\n\nWhite Memorial Fountain (The Claw)\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\nThe board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents.[117] Richard Saller became the twelfth president in September 2023.[118] The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[119][120] Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023.[121]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the university is organized into seven academic schools.[122] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments),[123] Engineering (nine departments),[124] and Sustainability (nine departments)[125] have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law,[126] Medicine,[127] Education,[128] and Business,[129] have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.[130]\n\n\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.[131] Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[132]\n\n\n\n### Endowment and donations[edit]\n\n\nThe university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was valued at $36.5 billion as of August 31, 2023.[4] Payouts from the Stanford endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.[4] In the 2018 NACUBO-TIAA survey of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, only Harvard University, the University of Texas System, and Yale University had larger endowments than Stanford.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Golden spike on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University\nIn 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009, two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[134][135] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; the new Cantor Arts Center; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[136][137] In 2012, the university raised $1.035 billion, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[138]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Stanford University announced a $75 million donation, in support of a multidisciplinary neurodegenerative brain disease research initiative at the university's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. The donation came from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny; hence The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience will explore cognitive declines from diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.[139]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| First-time fall freshman statistics\n |\n| --- |\n|  | 2021[140] | 2020[141] | 2019[142] | 2018[143] | 2017[144] |\n| Applicants\n | 55,471\n | 45,227\n | 47,498\n | 47,452\n | 44,073\n |\n| Admits\n | 2,190\n | 2,349\n | 2,062\n | 2,071\n | 2,085\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 3.9%\n | 5.19%\n | 4.34%\n | 4.36%\n | 4.73%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 1,757\n | 1,607\n | 1,701\n | 1,697\n | 1,703\n |\n| Yield | 80.23%\n | 68.41%\n | 82.49%\n | 81.94%\n | 81.68%\n |\n| SAT range\n | 1420–1570\n | 1420–1550\n | 1440–1550\n | 1420–1570\n | 1390–1540\n |\n| ACT range\n | 32–35\n | 31–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\nStanford is considered by *US News* to be 'most selective', with an acceptance rate of 4%. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score of 32 and 35. Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[145] In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.[142] Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.\n\n\nStanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents;[146] while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[147] In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[147] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[147] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[147] For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[148] Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants,[147] a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities[149] as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.[150] Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.[149]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\nStanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.[151] The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[151] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.[152]\n\n\n\n### Research centers and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hoover Tower, inspired by the cathedral tower at Salamanca in Spain\nMain article: Stanford University centers and institutes\n\nStanford is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[151] The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021-2022 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900+.[153] As of 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.[154]\n\n\nOther Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative[155] think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).\n\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses mainly five points, such as climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[157]\n\n\nTogether with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[158]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and digital resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green Library\nMain article: Stanford University Libraries\n\nAs of 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of twentieth century.[159] Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, thousands of other digital resources.[160] and 516,620 journal, 526,414 images, 11,000 software collection, 1,00,000 videos etc. .[161]\n\n\nThe main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.[162] It also has fifteen subject areas.[163]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronze statues by Auguste Rodin are scattered throughout the campus, including these *Burghers of Calais*.\nStanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum with twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world.[164] The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson.[165][166][167] There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and \"totem poles.\"\n\n\nThe Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[168] the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten *a cappella* groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first),[169] Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast),[170] the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers,[171] Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.[172]\n\n\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[173] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[174] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[175] | 1 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[176] | 2 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[177] | 2 |\n| *QS*[178] | 5 |\n| *THE*[179] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[180] | 3 |\n\n\n*Slate* in 2014 dubbed Stanford as \"the Harvard of the 21st century\".[182] In the same year *The New York Times* dubbed Harvard as the \"Stanford of the East\". In that article titled *To Young Minds of Today, Harvard Is the Stanford of the East* *The New York Times* concluded that \"Stanford University has become America's 'it' school, by measures that Harvard once dominated.\"[183] In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the *World's Most Innovative Universities* for the fifth consecutive year.[184] In 2022, *Washington Monthly* ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.[185] In a 2022 survey by *The Princeton Review*, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten \"dream colleges\" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate \"dream college\" of both students and parents.[186][187] Stanford Graduate School of Business was ranked 1st in the list of America's best business schools by *Bloomberg* for 2022.[188][189]\n\n\nFrom polls of college applicants done by The Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate \"dream college.\"[190][191] Globally Stanford is also ranked among the top universities in the world. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.[192] *Times Higher Education* recognizes Stanford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.[193][194]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carnegie Mellon discoveries and innovation, Illinois discoveries and innovation, MIT discoveries and innovation, and UC Berkeley discoveries and innovation\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix Bloch, physics professor, 1952 Nobel laureate for his work at Stanford\n* Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford.[195] By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.\n* First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.[196][197] Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.\n* Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.[198][199]\n* Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of the MRI.[200][201]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vint Cerf, co-leader of the Stanford team that designed the architecture of the internet\n* ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.[202][203] In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn & Vint Cerf's research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP(Transmission Control Program).[204]\n* Internet—Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.[205]\n* Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.[206][207]\n* Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford.[208] They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999. The SDLP's goal was \"to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\"[209] and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[210] Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n* Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford.[211] Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.[212] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.[213][214]\n* RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.[215]\n* SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation,[216] for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation,[217] which led to Sun Microsystems.\n\n\n### Businesses and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni\n\nStanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered a model for technology transfer.[41][42] Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies.[43] Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s.[218] When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\nCo-founders of Hewlett-Packard, Bill Hewlett (BS 1934), left, and David Packard (BA 1934), right\n\nSome companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:\n\n\n\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939: co-founders William R.

Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.[147] In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.[147] The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.[147] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.[232] As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[233]\n\n\n\n### Dormitories and student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford University student housing\n\nAs of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[147][234] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[235] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[236][237]\n\n\nMost student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).[238]\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.\nSeveral residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[235] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[239] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[240]\n\n\nCo-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[241] and Synergy.[242] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[243]\n\n\nAs of 2015, around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[244] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[245]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford Cardinal\n\n![](image)The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band rallies football fans with arrangements of \"All Right Now\" and other contemporary music\nAs of 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports,[246] nineteen club sports[247] and about 27 intramural sports[248] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[249] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal,\" referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[250] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n\n\nIts traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[252] In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.[254] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Summer Olympic Games since 1912.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\n* \"Hail, Stanford, Hail!\" is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[255][256]\n* Big Game: The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.\n* The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford's campus is named \"The Axe and Palm\" in reference to the Axe.[257]\n* Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.[258]\n* Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight. Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.[259]\n* The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a \"marriage pact\" with.[260][261][262][263]\n* Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford's main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university's 25 fountains.[259][264][265]\n* Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.[259][266] In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.[267] In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.[268]\n* Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.[265][269]\n* Steam Tunneling: Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes. Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles.[270] *Stanford Magazine* named steam tunneling one of the \"101 things you must do\" before graduating from the Farm in 2000.[271]\n* Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.[259]\n* Viennese Ball: a formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987) Stanford in Vienna overseas program.[272] It is now open to all students.\n* The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is \"*Die Luft der Freiheit weht.*\"[273] Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, \"The wind of freedom blows.\" The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.[1] It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.[274]\n* Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,[275][276] but in 1953 the \"degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman\" was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university. It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nStudents and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.\nStanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.[279] In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over twenty years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.\n\n\nIn addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[280]\nThe Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.[281] Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[282] and Hillel at Stanford.[283]\n\n\n\n### Greek life[edit]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Stanford had thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[287] Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[288]\n\n\n\n* Stanford is home to two unhoused historically National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC or \"Divine Nine\") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Delta Sigma Theta) and two unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi). These fraternities and sororities operate under the African American Fraternal Sororal Association (AAFSA) at Stanford.[289]\n* Seven historically National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).[290]\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).[291]\n* There are also four unhoused Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).[292]\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students on an urban hike organized by the Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB)\nAs of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.[293] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees,\" which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nStanford is home to a set of student journalism publications. *The Stanford Daily* is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.[298] The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[299] The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[300] *The Fountain Hopper* (*FoHo*) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story.[301] Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club.[302] Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[303]\n\n\nStanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.[304] Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.[305] StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups.[306] It is staffed primarily by students.[307] Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry.[308] Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[309][310] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.[311]\n\n\nStanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include José Mujica and Gustavo Petro.[312]\n\n\nOther groups include:\n\n\n\n* The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.[313]\n* Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971. This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.[314][315]\n* The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.[316] In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament[317] and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.[318]\n* Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.[319][320][321]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nStanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[322] The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[323] Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[324]\n\n\nMurder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.[325] Also notorious was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Campus sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[327] In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[328] According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[328] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[328]\n\n\nAssociated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[328] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from *The Washington Post* analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[327]\n\n\n\n#### *People v. Turner*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: People v. Turner\n\nOn the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.[329] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[330] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[331] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[332] Two years later the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.[333][334]\n\n\n\n#### Joe Lonsdale[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[335][336] Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[336] By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[336] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[337] Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[338]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Stanford University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Stanford University.\n\nAs of late 2021, Stanford had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical center faculty.[339]\n\n\n\n### Award laureates and scholars[edit]\n\n\nStanford's current community of scholars includes:\n\n\n\n* 22 Nobel Prize laureates (as of October 2022, 58 affiliates in total);[339]\n* 174 members of the National Academy of Sciences;[339]\n* 113 members of National Academy of Engineering;[339]\n* 90 members of National Academy of Medicine;[339]\n* 303 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;[339]\n* 10 recipients of the National Medal of Science;[339]\n* 3 recipients of the National Medal of Technology;[339]\n* 6 recipients of the National Humanities Medal;[339]\n* 47 members of American Philosophical Society;[339]\n* 56 fellows of the American Physics Society (since 1995);[340]\n* 4 Pulitzer Prize winners;[339]\n* 33 MacArthur Fellows;[339]\n* 6 Wolf Foundation Prize winners;[339]\n* 2 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award winners;[341]\n* 14 AAAI fellows;[342]\n* 2 Presidential Medal of Freedom winners.[339][343]\n\n\nStanford's faculty and former faculty includes 48 Nobel laureates,[339] five Fields Medalists, as well as seventeen winners of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with four Gödel Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and about fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to *Forbes*, has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities.[344][345][346] As of 2020, fifteen Stanford alumni have won the Nobel Prize.[347][348][349][350][351] As of 2022, 128 Stanford students or alumni have been named Rhodes Scholars.[352]\n\n\n\n* Notable Stanford alumni include:\n* ![Herbert Hoover (BS 1895), 31st President of the United States, founder of Hoover Institution at Stanford.

Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous. However, the University of the South has over 13,000 acres (20.3 sq mi; 52.6 km2).\n3. **^** The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s, the board decided that its fifteen members were not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee *ex officio*.[113] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. Grant (appointed in 1891), died in 1942.[114]\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t1. \"Rebecca S. Lowen. Creating the Cold War University: The Transformation of Stanford.

The campus occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students.[14] Stanford has been considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[a]\n\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford—a railroad magnate who served as the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California—and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever aged 15 the previous year.[2] The university admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\nThe university is organized around seven schools on the same campus: three schools consisting of 45 academic departments at the undergraduate level, as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The university also houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think-tank. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[17] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[18] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[19]\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 58 Nobel laureates, 29 Turing Award laureates,[note 1] and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty, or staff.[40] In addition, Stanford is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups.[41][42][43][44][45] Stanford alumni have founded numerous companies, which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue.[46][47][48] Stanford is the alma mater of U.S. President Herbert Hoover, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, 74 living billionaires, and 17 astronauts.[49] In academia, its alumni include the presidents and provosts of Yale, Harvard and Princeton. It is also one of the leading producers of Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.[50]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of the Stanford family on the Stanford University campus\n![](image)Center of the campus in 1891[51]\n![](image)Ichthyologist and founding president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan\nMain article: History of Stanford University\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr., their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, the Stanfords, particularly Jane, wanted their university to look different from the eastern ones, which had often sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant[53] that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" This guides the campus buildings to this day. The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.[54]\n\n\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.[55][56] The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored.[57]\n\n\nDuring the early-twentieth century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco;[58] it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.[59] The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923.[60] The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.[61] The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover.[62] In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Shockley, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate in physics, \"Father of Silicon Valley\"\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.[64] During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.[65] Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors.[66] Shockley and Terman are often described, separately or jointly, as the \"fathers of Silicon Valley\".[67][68]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.[69] Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL.[70][71]\n\n\nWallace Sterling was president 1949 to 1968. He oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, \"the Harvard of the West\".[72]\n\n\nAchievements during Sterling's tenure included:\n\n\n\n* Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.\n* Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university's finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university's aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.\n* Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.\n* Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.\n* Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.\n* Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.\n* Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.\n\n\nIn 2022, Stanford University issued a public apology for its discrimination against Jewish applicants in the 1950s, which was documented through internal memos involving Sterling.[73]\nIn the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, \"when it appeared on lists of the \"top ten\" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\"[74] Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\",[75] but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical,[76] and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding[77][78] and the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.[79]\n\n\n\n## Land[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The center of the Stanford University campus\nMost of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[6] campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2] It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose. $4.5 billion was received by Stanford in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[82]\n\n\nStanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County,[83] although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[84]\n\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the main quadrangle of Stanford with Memorial Church in the center background from across the grass-covered Oval\n\n\n### Non-central campus[edit]\n\n\nStanford currently operates in several locations beyond its central campus.\n\n\nOn the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. Researchers and students are involved in biological research. Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community. The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.[89]\n* SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on 426 acres (172 ha) of land.[90]\n\n\nOff the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892. Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories. It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes.[91] A graduate student of the anthropology department discover some broken elements, which leads to proof that 100 years before it was home to a Chinese American fishing village.[92]\n* Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a \"mini-Stanford.\"[93]\n* Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by The Great Recession.[94][95] In 2015 the university announced a development plan[96] and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.[97]\n* The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates.[98] It includes a small art gallery open to the public.[99]\n* China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.[100][101]\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Lagunita in winter; the Dish, a large radio telescope, and local landmark, is visible in the Stanford-owned foothills behind the lake and is the high point of a popular campus jogging and walking trail.\n\n\n### Faculty residences[edit]\n\n\nMany Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[102] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.[103]\n\n\n\n### Other uses[edit]\n\n\nSome of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[104] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.[105] Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course[106] and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center[107] used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nContemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as \"The Claw\") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of \"fountain hopping\"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[108][109][110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Interior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad](image)\n\nInterior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad\n* ![Hoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus](image)\n\nHoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus\n* ![The new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games](image)\n\nThe new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games\n* ![Stanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background](image)\n\nStanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background\n* ![The Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus](image)\n\nThe Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus\n* ![White Memorial Fountain (The Claw)](image)\n\nWhite Memorial Fountain (The Claw)\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\nThe board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents.[117] Richard Saller became the twelfth president in September 2023.[118] The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[119][120] Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023.[121]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the university is organized into seven academic schools.[122] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments),[123] Engineering (nine departments),[124] and Sustainability (nine departments)[125] have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law,[126] Medicine,[127] Education,[128] and Business,[129] have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.[130]\n\n\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.[131] Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[132]\n\n\n\n### Endowment and donations[edit]\n\n\nThe university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was valued at $36.5 billion as of August 31, 2023.[4] Payouts from the Stanford endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.[4] In the 2018 NACUBO-TIAA survey of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, only Harvard University, the University of Texas System, and Yale University had larger endowments than Stanford.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Golden spike on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University\nIn 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009, two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[134][135] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; the new Cantor Arts Center; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[136][137] In 2012, the university raised $1.035 billion, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[138]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Stanford University announced a $75 million donation, in support of a multidisciplinary neurodegenerative brain disease research initiative at the university's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. The donation came from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny; hence The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience will explore cognitive declines from diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.[139]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| First-time fall freshman statistics\n |\n| --- |\n|  | 2021[140] | 2020[141] | 2019[142] | 2018[143] | 2017[144] |\n| Applicants\n | 55,471\n | 45,227\n | 47,498\n | 47,452\n | 44,073\n |\n| Admits\n | 2,190\n | 2,349\n | 2,062\n | 2,071\n | 2,085\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 3.9%\n | 5.19%\n | 4.34%\n | 4.36%\n | 4.73%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 1,757\n | 1,607\n | 1,701\n | 1,697\n | 1,703\n |\n| Yield | 80.23%\n | 68.41%\n | 82.49%\n | 81.94%\n | 81.68%\n |\n| SAT range\n | 1420–1570\n | 1420–1550\n | 1440–1550\n | 1420–1570\n | 1390–1540\n |\n| ACT range\n | 32–35\n | 31–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\nStanford is considered by *US News* to be 'most selective', with an acceptance rate of 4%. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score of 32 and 35. Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[145] In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.[142] Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.\n\n\nStanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents;[146] while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[147] In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[147] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[147] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[147] For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[148] Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants,[147] a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities[149] as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.[150] Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.[149]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\nStanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.[151] The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[151] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.[152]\n\n\n\n### Research centers and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hoover Tower, inspired by the cathedral tower at Salamanca in Spain\nMain article: Stanford University centers and institutes\n\nStanford is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[151] The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021-2022 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900+.[153] As of 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.[154]\n\n\nOther Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative[155] think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).\n\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses mainly five points, such as climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[157]\n\n\nTogether with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[158]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and digital resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green Library\nMain article: Stanford University Libraries\n\nAs of 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of twentieth century.[159] Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, thousands of other digital resources.[160] and 516,620 journal, 526,414 images, 11,000 software collection, 1,00,000 videos etc. .[161]\n\n\nThe main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.[162] It also has fifteen subject areas.[163]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronze statues by Auguste Rodin are scattered throughout the campus, including these *Burghers of Calais*.\nStanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum with twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world.[164] The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson.[165][166][167] There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and \"totem poles.\"\n\n\nThe Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[168] the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten *a cappella* groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first),[169] Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast),[170] the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers,[171] Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.[172]\n\n\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[173] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[174] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[175] | 1 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[176] | 2 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[177] | 2 |\n| *QS*[178] | 5 |\n| *THE*[179] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[180] | 3 |\n\n\n*Slate* in 2014 dubbed Stanford as \"the Harvard of the 21st century\".[182] In the same year *The New York Times* dubbed Harvard as the \"Stanford of the East\". In that article titled *To Young Minds of Today, Harvard Is the Stanford of the East* *The New York Times* concluded that \"Stanford University has become America's 'it' school, by measures that Harvard once dominated.\"[183] In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the *World's Most Innovative Universities* for the fifth consecutive year.[184] In 2022, *Washington Monthly* ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.[185] In a 2022 survey by *The Princeton Review*, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten \"dream colleges\" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate \"dream college\" of both students and parents.[186][187] Stanford Graduate School of Business was ranked 1st in the list of America's best business schools by *Bloomberg* for 2022.[188][189]\n\n\nFrom polls of college applicants done by The Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate \"dream college.\"[190][191] Globally Stanford is also ranked among the top universities in the world. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.[192] *Times Higher Education* recognizes Stanford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.[193][194]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carnegie Mellon discoveries and innovation, Illinois discoveries and innovation, MIT discoveries and innovation, and UC Berkeley discoveries and innovation\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix Bloch, physics professor, 1952 Nobel laureate for his work at Stanford\n* Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford.[195] By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.\n* First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.[196][197] Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.\n* Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.[198][199]\n* Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of the MRI.[200][201]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vint Cerf, co-leader of the Stanford team that designed the architecture of the internet\n* ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.[202][203] In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn & Vint Cerf's research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP(Transmission Control Program).[204]\n* Internet—Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.[205]\n* Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.[206][207]\n* Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford.[208] They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999. The SDLP's goal was \"to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\"[209] and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[210] Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n* Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford.[211] Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.[212] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.[213][214]\n* RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.[215]\n* SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation,[216] for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation,[217] which led to Sun Microsystems.\n\n\n### Businesses and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni\n\nStanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered a model for technology transfer.[41][42] Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies.[43] Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s.[218] When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\nCo-founders of Hewlett-Packard, Bill Hewlett (BS 1934), left, and David Packard (BA 1934), right\n\nSome companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:\n\n\n\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939: co-founders William R.

Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.[147] In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.[147] The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.[147] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.[232] As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[233]\n\n\n\n### Dormitories and student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford University student housing\n\nAs of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[147][234] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[235] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[236][237]\n\n\nMost student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).[238]\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.\nSeveral residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[235] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[239] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[240]\n\n\nCo-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[241] and Synergy.[242] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[243]\n\n\nAs of 2015, around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[244] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[245]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford Cardinal\n\n![](image)The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band rallies football fans with arrangements of \"All Right Now\" and other contemporary music\nAs of 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports,[246] nineteen club sports[247] and about 27 intramural sports[248] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[249] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal,\" referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[250] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n\n\nIts traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[252] In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.[254] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Summer Olympic Games since 1912.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\n* \"Hail, Stanford, Hail!\" is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[255][256]\n* Big Game: The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.\n* The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford's campus is named \"The Axe and Palm\" in reference to the Axe.[257]\n* Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.[258]\n* Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight. Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.[259]\n* The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a \"marriage pact\" with.[260][261][262][263]\n* Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford's main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university's 25 fountains.[259][264][265]\n* Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.[259][266] In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.[267] In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.[268]\n* Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.[265][269]\n* Steam Tunneling: Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes. Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles.[270] *Stanford Magazine* named steam tunneling one of the \"101 things you must do\" before graduating from the Farm in 2000.[271]\n* Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.[259]\n* Viennese Ball: a formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987) Stanford in Vienna overseas program.[272] It is now open to all students.\n* The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is \"*Die Luft der Freiheit weht.*\"[273] Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, \"The wind of freedom blows.\" The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.[1] It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.[274]\n* Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,[275][276] but in 1953 the \"degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman\" was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university. It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nStudents and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.\nStanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.[279] In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over twenty years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.\n\n\nIn addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[280]\nThe Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.[281] Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[282] and Hillel at Stanford.[283]\n\n\n\n### Greek life[edit]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Stanford had thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[287] Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[288]\n\n\n\n* Stanford is home to two unhoused historically National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC or \"Divine Nine\") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Delta Sigma Theta) and two unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi). These fraternities and sororities operate under the African American Fraternal Sororal Association (AAFSA) at Stanford.[289]\n* Seven historically National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).[290]\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).[291]\n* There are also four unhoused Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).[292]\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students on an urban hike organized by the Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB)\nAs of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.[293] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees,\" which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nStanford is home to a set of student journalism publications. *The Stanford Daily* is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.[298] The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[299] The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[300] *The Fountain Hopper* (*FoHo*) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story.[301] Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club.[302] Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[303]\n\n\nStanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.[304] Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.[305] StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups.[306] It is staffed primarily by students.[307] Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry.[308] Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[309][310] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.[311]\n\n\nStanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include José Mujica and Gustavo Petro.[312]\n\n\nOther groups include:\n\n\n\n* The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.[313]\n* Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971. This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.[314][315]\n* The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.[316] In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament[317] and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.[318]\n* Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.[319][320][321]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nStanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[322] The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[323] Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[324]\n\n\nMurder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.[325] Also notorious was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Campus sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[327] In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[328] According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[328] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[328]\n\n\nAssociated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[328] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from *The Washington Post* analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[327]\n\n\n\n#### *People v. Turner*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: People v. Turner\n\nOn the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.[329] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[330] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[331] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[332] Two years later the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.[333][334]\n\n\n\n#### Joe Lonsdale[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[335][336] Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[336] By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[336] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[337] Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[338]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Stanford University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Stanford University.\n\nAs of late 2021, Stanford had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical center faculty.[339]\n\n\n\n### Award laureates and scholars[edit]\n\n\nStanford's current community of scholars includes:\n\n\n\n* 22 Nobel Prize laureates (as of October 2022, 58 affiliates in total);[339]\n* 174 members of the National Academy of Sciences;[339]\n* 113 members of National Academy of Engineering;[339]\n* 90 members of National Academy of Medicine;[339]\n* 303 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;[339]\n* 10 recipients of the National Medal of Science;[339]\n* 3 recipients of the National Medal of Technology;[339]\n* 6 recipients of the National Humanities Medal;[339]\n* 47 members of American Philosophical Society;[339]\n* 56 fellows of the American Physics Society (since 1995);[340]\n* 4 Pulitzer Prize winners;[339]\n* 33 MacArthur Fellows;[339]\n* 6 Wolf Foundation Prize winners;[339]\n* 2 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award winners;[341]\n* 14 AAAI fellows;[342]\n* 2 Presidential Medal of Freedom winners.[339][343]\n\n\nStanford's faculty and former faculty includes 48 Nobel laureates,[339] five Fields Medalists, as well as seventeen winners of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with four Gödel Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and about fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science. Stanford alumni have started many companies and, according to *Forbes*, has produced the second highest number of billionaires of all universities.[344][345][346] As of 2020, fifteen Stanford alumni have won the Nobel Prize.[347][348][349][350][351] As of 2022, 128 Stanford students or alumni have been named Rhodes Scholars.[352]\n\n\n\n* Notable Stanford alumni include:\n* ![Herbert Hoover (BS 1895), 31st President of the United States, founder of Hoover Institution at Stanford.

Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous. However, the University of the South has over 13,000 acres (20.3 sq mi; 52.6 km2).\n3. **^** The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s, the board decided that its fifteen members were not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee *ex officio*.[113] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. Grant (appointed in 1891), died in 1942.[114]\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t1. \"Rebecca S. Lowen. Creating the Cold War University: The Transformation of Stanford.

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  **College of New Jersey**, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8][9][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, and then to the current site nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\n\n\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its 600 acres (2.4 km2) main campus. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and has one of the largest university libraries in the world.[14]\n\n\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its upperclassmen eating clubs. The university has over 500 student organizations. Princeton students embrace a wide variety of traditions from both the past and present. The university is a NCAA Division I school and competes in the Ivy League. The school's athletic team, the Princeton Tigers, has won the most titles in its conference and has sent many students and alumni to the Olympics.\n\n\nAs of October 2021, 75 Nobel laureates, 16 Fields Medalists and 16 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, Princeton has been associated with 21 National Medal of Science awardees, 5 Abel Prize awardees, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 217 Rhodes Scholars, 137 Marshall Scholars, and\n62 Gates Cambridge Scholars. Two U.S. presidents, twelve U.S. Supreme Court Justices (three of whom currently serve on the court) and numerous living industry and media tycoons and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has graduated many members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight Secretaries of State, three Secretaries of Defense and two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Princeton University\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![A drawing of the Log College](image)The Log College, an influential aspect of Princeton's development\nPrinceton University, founded as the College of New Jersey, was shaped much in its formative years by the \"Log College\", a seminary founded by the Reverend William Tennent at Neshaminy, Pennsylvania, in about 1726. While no legal connection ever existed, many of the pupils and adherents from the Log College would go on to financially support and become substantially involved in the early years of the university.[12] While early writers considered it as the predecessor of the university,[15] the idea has been rebuked by Princeton historians.[16][12]\n\n\nThe founding of the university itself originated from a split in the Presbyterian church following the Great Awakening.[17] In 1741, New Light Presbyterians were expelled from the Synod of Philadelphia in defense of how the Log College ordained ministers.[18] The four founders of the College of New Jersey, who were New Lights, were either expelled or withdrew from the Synod and devised a plan to establish a new college, for they were disappointed with Harvard and Yale's opposition to the Great Awakening and dissatisfied with the limited instruction at the Log College.[18][17] They convinced three other Presbyterians to join them and decided on New Jersey as the location for the college, as at the time, there was no institution between Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, and the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia; it was also where some of the founders preached.[19] Although their initial request was rejected by the Anglican governor Lewis Morrison, the acting governor after Morrison's death, John Hamilton, granted a charter for the College of New Jersey on October 22, 1746.[20][19] In 1747, approximately five months after acquiring the charter, the trustees elected Jonathan Dickinson as president and opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey,[20] where classes were held in Dickinson's parsonage.[21] With its founding, it became the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and one of nine colonial colleges charted before the American Revolution.[8][9] The founders aimed for the college to have an expansive curriculum to teach people of various professions, not solely ministerial work.[22][20] Though the school was open to those of any religious denomination,[23] with many of the founders being of Presbyterian faith, the college became the educational and religious capital of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian America.[24]\n\n\n\n### Colonial and early years[edit]\n\n\n![An engraving of Nassau Hall from 1760](image)From 1760, the first picture of Nassau Hall\nIn 1747, following the death of then President Jonathan Dickinson, the college moved from Elizabeth to Newark, New Jersey, as that was where presidential successor Aaron Burr Sr.'s parsonage was located.[20] That same year, Princeton's first charter came under dispute by Anglicans, but on September 14, 1748, the recently appointed governor Jonathan Belcher granted a second charter.[25][26] Belcher, a Congregationalist, had become alienated from his alma mater, Harvard, and decided to \"adopt\" the infant college.[25][23] Belcher would go on to raise funds for the college and donate his 474-volume library, making it one of the largest libraries in the colonies.[25][27]\n\n\n\nIn 1756, the college moved again to its present home in Princeton, New Jersey, because Newark was felt to be too close to New York.[28][29] Princeton was chosen for its central location in New Jersey and by strong recommendation by Belcher.[25][30] The college's home in Princeton was Nassau Hall, named for the royal William III of England, a member of the House of Orange-Nassau.[31] The trustees of the College of New Jersey initially suggested that Nassau Hall be named in recognition of Belcher because of his interest in the institution; the governor vetoed the request.[25] \n\n![A portrait of John Witherspoon](image)John Witherspoon, President of the college (1768–94) and signer of the Declaration of Independence\nBurr, who would die in 1757, devised a curriculum for the school and enlarged the student body.[32] Following the untimely death of Burr and the college's next three presidents,[33] John Witherspoon became president in 1768 and remained in that post until his death in 1794.[34] With his presidency, Witherspoon focused the college on preparing a new generation of both educated clergy and secular leadership in the new American nation.[35][36] To this end, he tightened academic standards, broadened the curriculum, solicited investment for the college, and grew its size.[37][36]\n\n\nA signer of the Declaration of Independence, Witherspoon and his leadership led the college to becoming influential to the American Revolution.[34][38][39] In 1777, the college became the site for the Battle of Princeton.[34] During the battle, British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall before eventually surrendering to American forces led by General George Washington.[40] During the summer and fall of 1783, the Continental Congress and Washington met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months;[41] Nassau Hall is where Congress learned of the peace treaty between the colonies and the British.[42][43] The college did suffer from the revolution, with a depreciated endowment and hefty repair bills for Nassau Hall.[44]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1795, President Samuel Stanhope Smith took office, the first alumnus to become president.[45] Nassau Hall suffered a large fire that destroyed its interior in 1802, which Smith blamed on rebellious students.[46] The college raised funds for reconstruction, as well as the construction of two new buildings.[47] In 1807, a large student riot occurred at Nassau Hall, spurred by underlying distrust of educational reforms by Smith away from the Church.[45][48] Following Smith's mishandling of the situation, falling enrollment, and faculty resignations, the trustees of the university offered resignation to Smith, which he accepted.[47] In 1812, Ashbel Green was unanimously elected by the trustees of the college to become the eighth president.[49] After the liberal tenure of Smith, Green represented the conservative \"Old Side,\" in which he introduced rigorous disciplinary rules and heavily embraced religion.[50][51] Even so, believing the college was not religious enough, he took a prominent role in establishing the Princeton Theological Seminary next door.[50][49] While student riots were a frequent occurrence during Green's tenure, enrollment did increase under his administration.[52]\n\n\n\nIn 1823, James Carnahan became president, arriving as an unprepared and timid leader.[53][54] With the college riven by conflicting views between students, faculty, and trustees, and enrollment hitting its lowest in years, Carnahan considered closing the university.[53] Carnahan's successor, John Maclean Jr., who was only a professor at the time, recommended saving the university with the help of alumni; as a result, Princeton's alumni association, led by James Madison, was created and began raising funds.[53][55] With Carnahan and Maclean, now vice-president, working as partners, enrollment and faculty increased, tensions decreased, and the college campus expanded.[55] Maclean took over the presidency in 1854, and led the university through the American Civil War.[56] When Nassau Hall burned down again in 1855,[57] Maclean raised funds and used the money to rebuild Nassau Hall and run the university on an austerity budget during the war years.[56] With a third of students from the college being from the South, enrollment fell.[58] Once many of the Southerners left, the campus became a sharp proponent for the Union,[59] even bestowing an honorary degree to President Lincoln.[60]\n\n![A portrait of James McCosh](image)James McCosh, President of the college (1868–88)James McCosh became the college's president in 1868, and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the war.[61] During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, recruited distinguished faculty, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic style to the campus.[61][62] McCosh's tenure also saw the creation and rise of many extracurricular activities, like the Princeton Glee Club, the Triangle Club, the first intercollegiate football team, and the first permanent eating club,[63] as well as the elimination of fraternities and sororities.[64] In 1879, Princeton conferred its first doctorates on James F. Williamson and William Libby, both members of the Class of 1877.[65]\n\n\nFrancis Patton took the presidency in 1888, and although his election was not met by unanimous enthusiasm, he was well received by undergraduates.[66] Patton's administration was marked with great change, for Princeton's enrollment and faculty had doubled. At the same time, the college underwent large expansion and social life was changing in reflection of the rise in eating clubs and burgeoning interest in athletics.[67] In 1893, the honor system was established, allowing for unproctored exams.[68][69] In 1896, the college officially became a university,[70] and as a result, it officially changed its name to Princeton University.[71] In 1900, the Graduate School was formally established.[70] Even with such accomplishments, Patton's administration remained lackluster with its administrative structure[72] and towards its educational standards.[68] Due to profile changes in the board of trustees and dissatisfaction with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1902.[72]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Woodrow Wilson as president of Princeton](image)Woodrow Wilson, President of Princeton University (1902–10) and 28th president of the United States\nFollowing Patton's resignation, Woodrow Wilson, an alumnus and popular professor, was elected the 13th president of the university.[73][74] Noticing falling academic standards, Wilson orchestrated significant changes to the curriculum, where freshman and sophomores followed a unified curriculum while juniors and seniors concentrated study in one discipline.[75] Ambitious seniors were allowed to undertake independent work, which would eventually shape Princeton's emphasis on the practice for the future.[76] Wilson further reformed the educational system by introducing the preceptorial system in 1905,[75] a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.[77] The changes brought about many new faculty and cemented Princeton's academics for the first half of the 20th century.[78] Due to the tightening of academic standards, enrollment declined severely until 1907.[75] In 1906, the reservoir Lake Carnegie was created by Andrew Carnegie,[79] and the university officially became nonsectarian.[80] Before leaving office, Wilson strengthened the science program to focus on \"pure\" research and broke the Presbyterian lock on the board of trustees.[73][81] However, he did fail in winning support for the permanent location of the Graduate School and the elimination of the eating clubs, which he proposed replacing with quadrangles, a precursor to the residential college system.[82] Wilson also continued to keep Princeton closed off from accepting Black students.[83] When an aspiring Black student wrote a letter to Wilson, he got his secretary to reply telling him to attend a university where he would be more welcome.[84]\n\n\nJohn Grier Hibben became president in 1912, and would remain in the post for two decades.[85] On October 2, 1913, the Princeton University Graduate College was dedicated.[79] When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Hibben allocated all available University resources to the government. As a result, military training schools opened on campus and laboratories and other facilities were used for research and operational programs. Overall, more than 6,000 students served in the armed forces, with 151 dying during the war.[86] After the war, enrollment spiked and the trustees established the system of selective admission in 1922.[87] From the 1920s to the 1930s, the student body featured many students from preparatory schools, zero Black students, and dwindling Jewish enrollment because of quotas.[88] Aside from managing Princeton during WWI, Hibben introduced the senior thesis in 1923 as a part of The New Plan of Study.[89][90] He also brought about great expansion to the university, with the creation of the School of Architecture in 1919, the School of Engineering in 1921, and the School of Public and International Affairs in 1930.[91] By the end of his presidency, the endowment had increased by 374 percent, the total area of the campus doubled, the faculty experienced impressive growth, and the enrollment doubled.[92][90]\n\n\nHibben's successor, Harold Willis Dodds would lead the university through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict.[93] With the Great Depression, many students were forced to withdraw due to financial reasons.[94] At the same time, Princeton's reputation in physics and mathematics surged as many European scientists left for the United States due to uneasy tension caused by Nazi Germany.[95] In 1930, the Institute for Advanced Study was founded to provide a space for the influx of scientists, such as Albert Einstein.[96] Many Princeton scientists would work on the Manhattan Project during the war, [97] including the entire physics department.[98] During World War II, Princeton offered an accelerated program for students to graduate early before entering the armed forces.[99] Student enrollment fluctuated from month to month, and many faculty were forced to teach unfamiliar subjects. Still, Dodds maintained academic standards and would establish a program for servicemen, so they could resume their education once discharged.[100]\n\n\n\n### 1945 to present[edit]\n\n\nPost-war years saw scholars renewing broken bonds through numerous conventions, expansion of the campus, and the introduction of distribution requirements.[101][102] The period saw the desegregation of Princeton, which was stimulated by changes to the New Jersey constitution.[103] Princeton began undertaking a sharper focus towards research in the years after the war, with the construction of Firestone Library in 1948 and the establishment of the Forrestal Research Center in the 1950s.[104] Government sponsored research increased sharply, particularly in the physics and engineering departments,[105] with much of it occurring at the new Forrestal campus.[106] Though, as the years progressed, scientific research at the Forrestal campus declined, and in 1973, some of the land was converted to commercial and residential spaces.[107]\n\n\nRobert Goheen would succeed Dodds by unanimous vote and serve as president until 1972.[108] Goheen's presidency was characterized as being more liberal than previous presidents, and his presidency would see a rise in Black applicants,[109] as well as the eventual coeducation of the university in 1969.[110] During this period of rising diversity, the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center) was dedicated in 1971.[111] Goheen also oversaw great expansion for the university, with square footage increasing by 80 percentage.[112]\n\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Princeton experienced unprecedented activism, with most of it centered on the Vietnam War.[113][114] While Princeton activism initially remained relatively timid compared to other institutions,[113] protests began to grow with the founding of a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1965, which organized many of the later Princeton protests.[113] In 1966, the SDS gained prominence on campus following picketing against a speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which gained frontpage coverage by the *New York Times.*[115][116] A notable point of contention on campus was the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and would feature multiple protests,[113] some of which required police action.[117] As the years went on, the protests' agenda broadened to investments in South Africa, environmental issues, and women's rights.[113][118] In response to these broadening protests, the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) was founded to serve as a method for greater student voice in governance.[119] Activism culminated in 1970 with a student, faculty, and staff member strike, so the university could become an \"institution against expansion of the war.\"[120][b] Princeton's protests would taper off later that year, with *The* *Daily Princetonian* saying that, \"Princeton 1970–71 was an emotionally burned out university.\"\n\n\nIn 1982, the residential college system was officially established under Goheen's successor William G. Bowen, who would serve until 1988.[121][122] During his presidency, Princeton's endowment increased from $625 million to $2 billion, and a major fundraising drive known as \"A Campaign for Princeton\" was conducted.[122] President Harold T. Shapiro would succeed Bowen and remain president until 2001. Shapiro would continue to increase the endowment, expand academic programs, raise student diversity, and oversee the most renovations in Princeton's history.[123] One of Shapiro's initiatives was the formation of the multidisciplinary Princeton Environmental Institute in 1994, renamed the High Meadows Environmental Institute in 2020.[124][125] In 2001, Princeton shifted the financial aid policy to a system that replaced all loans with grants.[126] That same year, Princeton elected its first female president, Shirley M. Tilghman.[127] Before retiring in 2012, Tilghman expanded financial aid offerings and conducted several major construction projects like the Lewis Center for the Arts and a sixth residential college.[128] Tilghman also lead initiatives for more global programs, the creation of an office of sustainability, and investments into the sciences.[129]\n\n\nPrinceton's 20th and current president Christopher Eisgruber was elected in 2013.[130] In 2017, Princeton University unveiled a large-scale public history and digital humanities investigation into its historical involvement with slavery called the Princeton & Slavery Project. The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project.[131] In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project.[132] In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to Campus sexual assault.[133][134] The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.[135]\n\n\n\n### Coeducation[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton explicitly prohibited the admission of women from its founding in 1746 until 1969. Since it lacked an affiliated women's college, it was often referred to as a \"monastery\", both lovingly and derisively, by members of the Princeton community.[136][137]\nFor about a decade, from 1887 to 1897, nearby Evelyn College for Women was largely comprised of daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrations, like Francis Patton, were on its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, Joshua McIlvaine.[138]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pyne Hall, where the first female students lived on campus.\nIn 1947, three female members of the library staff enrolled in beginner Russian courses to deal with an increase in Russian literature in the library.[110]\n\n\nIn 1961, Princeton admitted its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey,[136] who would go on to be the first woman to earn a master's degree at Princeton.[110] Meservey was, at the time of her admission, already a member of the faculty at Douglass College within Princeton. The dean of the graduate school issued a statement clarifying that Meservey's admission was an exception, and that \"Princeton may permit other women in the future as special cases, but does not plan to make general admissions of women graduate students.\"[139] The student-run *Daily Princetonian* ran four articles about Meservey in one issue,[139][140][141][142] including an editorial lamenting the potential \"far reaching implications\" of Meservey's admission which concluded: \"Princeton is unique as an undergraduate men's college and must remain so.\"[142] Eight more women enrolled the following year in the Graduate School.[136] In 1964, T'sai-ying Cheng became the first woman at Princeton to receive a Ph.D. In 1963, five women came to Princeton for one year to study \"critical languages\" as undergraduates, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.[110] Following abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the university in 1967,[143] the administration commissioned a report on admitting women. The final report was issued in January 1969, supporting the idea.[110] That same month, Princeton's trustees voted 24–8 in favor of coeducation and began preparing the institution for the transition.[144] The university finished these plans in April 1969 and announced there would be coeducation in September.[145] Ultimately, 101 female freshman and 70 female transfer students enrolled at Princeton in September 1969.[146][145][c] Those admitted were housed in Pyne Hall, a fairly isolated dormitory; a security system was added, although the women deliberately broke it within a day.[148]\n\n\nIn 1971, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Savage Speers became the first female trustees,[110] and in 1974, quotas for men and women were eliminated.[149] Following a 1979 lawsuit, the eating clubs were required to go coeducational in 1991, after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.[150] In 2001, Princeton elected its first female president.[127]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Washington Road Elm Allée, which is one of the entrances to the campus](image)The eastern side of the Washington Road Elm Allée, one of the entrances to the campus\nThe main campus consists of more than 200 buildings on 600 acres (2.4 km2) in Princeton, New Jersey.[4] The James Forrestal Campus, a smaller location designed mainly as a research and instruction complex, is split between nearby Plainsboro and South Brunswick. The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train.[151] The university also owns more than 520 acres (2.1 km2) of property in West Windsor Township,[4] and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".[152]\n\n\nThe first building on campus was Nassau Hall, completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of the campus facing Nassau Street.[153] The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century.[154][155] The McCosh presidency (1868–88) saw the construction of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, although many of them are now gone, leaving the remaining few to appear out of place.[156] At the end of the 19th century, much of Princeton's architecture was designed by the Cope and Stewardson firm (led by the same University of Pennsylvania professors of architecture who designed a large part of Washington University in St. Louis and University of Pennsylvania) resulting in the Collegiate Gothic style for which Princeton is known for today.[157] Implemented initially by William Appleton Potter,[157] and later enforced by the university's supervising architect, Ralph Adams Cram,[158] the Collegiate Gothic style remained the standard for all new building on the Princeton campus until 1960.[159][160] A flurry of construction projects in the 1960s produced a number of new buildings on the south side of the main campus, many of which have been poorly received.[161] Several prominent architects have contributed some more recent additions, including Frank Gehry (Lewis Library),[162] I. M. Pei (Spelman Halls),[163] Demetri Porphyrios (Whitman College, a Collegiate Gothic project),[164] Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (Frist Campus Center, among several others),[165] Minoru Yamasaki (Robertson Hall),[166] and Rafael Viñoly (Carl Icahn Laboratory).[167]\n\n\nA group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by Alexander Calder (*Five Disks: One Empty*), Jacob Epstein (*Albert Einstein*), Henry Moore (*Oval with Points*), Isamu Noguchi (*White Sun*), and Pablo Picasso (*Head of a Woman*).[168] Richard Serra's *The Hedgehog and The Fox* is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.[169]\n\n\nAt the southern edge of the campus is Lake Carnegie, an artificial lake named for Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financed the lake's construction in 1906 at the behest of a friend and his brother who were both Princeton alumni.[170] Carnegie hoped the opportunity to take up rowing would inspire Princeton students to forsake football, which he considered \"not gentlemanly.\"[171] The Shea Rowing Center on the lake's shore continues to serve as the headquarters for Princeton rowing.[172]\n\n\nPrinceton's grounds were designed by Beatrix Farrand between 1912 and 1943. Her contributions were most recently recognized with the naming of a courtyard for her.[173] Subsequent changes to the landscape were introduced by Quennell Rothschild & Partners in 2000. In 2005, Michael Van Valkenburgh was hired as the new consulting landscape architect for Princeton's 2016 Campus Plan.[174] Lynden B. Miller was invited to work with him as Princeton's consulting gardening architect, focusing on the 17 gardens that are distributed throughout the campus.[175]\n\n\n\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\n#### Nassau Hall[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building](image)Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building and former capitol of the United States. Pictured in front is Cannon Green.\nNassau Hall is the oldest building on campus. Begun in 1754 and completed in 1756,[176] it was the first seat of the New Jersey Legislature in 1776,[177] was involved in the Battle of Princeton in 1777,[178] and was the seat of the Congress of the Confederation (and thus capitol of the United States) from June 30, 1783, to November 4, 1783.[179] Since 1911, the front entrance has been flanked by two bronze tigers, a gift of the Princeton Class of 1879, which replaced two lions previously given in 1889.[180] Starting in 1922, commencement has been held on the front lawn of Nassau Hall when there is good weather.[181] In 1966, Nassau Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[182] Nowadays, it houses the office of the university president and other administrative offices.[183][184]\n\n\nTo the south of Nassau Hall lies a courtyard that is known as Cannon Green.[185] Buried in the ground at the center is the \"Big Cannon,\" which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the Battle of Princeton. It remained in Princeton until the War of 1812, when it was taken to New Brunswick.[186] In 1836, the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. Two years later, it was moved to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students, and in 1840, it was buried in its current location.[187] A second \"Little Cannon\" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby Whig Hall. The cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of Rutgers University in 1875. The theft ignited the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.[187] The protruding cannons are occasionally painted scarlet by Rutgers students who continue the traditional dispute.[188][189]\n\n\n\n#### Art Museum[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Princeton University Art Museum](image)The Princeton University Art Museum, which holds over 112,000 objects\nThough art collection at the university dates back to its very founding, the Princeton University Art Museum was not officially established until 1882 by President McCosh. Its establishment arose from a desire to provide direct access to works of art in a museum for a curriculum in the arts, an education system familiar to many European universities at the time. The museum took on the purposes of providing \"exposure to original works of art and to teach the history of art through an encyclopedic collection of world art.\"[190]\n\n\nNumbering over 112,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and come from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.[191] The museum's art is divided into ten extensive curatorial areas.[192] There is a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including ceramics, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in Antioch, as well as other art from the ancient Egyptian, Byzantium, and Islamic worlds.[193] The non-Islamic coins were catalogued by Dorothy B. Waage.[194] Medieval Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early Renaissance through the 19th century, with pieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh,[195] and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.[196]\n\n\nThe museum features a collection of Chinese and Japanese art, with holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and calligraphy, as well as collections of Korean, Southeast, and Central Asian art.[197] Its collection of pre-Columbian art includes examples of Mayan and Olmec art, and its indigenous art ranges from Chile to Alaska to Greenland.[198] The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings,[199] and it has a comprehensive collection of over 20,000 photographs.[200] Approximately 750 works of African art are represented.[201] The Museum oversees the outside John B.

It was built between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million,[203] approximately $40.8 million adjusted for inflation in 2020. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed the chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.[204] At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after King's College Chapel, Cambridge.[205] It underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.[206] The Chapel seats around 2,000 and serves as a site for religious services and local celebrations.[207]\n\n\nMeasured on the exterior, the chapel is 277 feet (84 m) long, 76 feet (23 m) wide at its transepts, and 121 feet (37 m) high.[208] The exterior is Pennsylvania sandstone, trimmed with Indiana limestone, and the interior is made of limestone and Aquia Creek sandstone.[208] The design evokes characteristics of an English church of the Middle Ages.[208] The extensive iconography, in stained glass, stonework, and wood carvings, has the common theme of connecting religion and scholarship.[204]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nPublished in 2008, the Sustainability Action Plan was the first formal plan for sustainability enacted by the university.[209] It focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of resources, and research, education, and civic engagement for sustainability through 10 year objectives.[210][211] Since the 2008 plan, Princeton has aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels without the purchase of market offsets and predicts to meet the goal by 2026 (the former goal was by 2020 but COVID-19 requirements delayed this).[212] Princeton released its second Sustainability Action Plan in 2019 on Earth Day with its main goal being reducing campus greenhouse gases to net zero by 2046 as well as other objectives building on those in the 2008 plan.[211][212] In 2021, the university agreed to divest from thermal coal and tar sand segments of the fossil fuel industry and from companies that are involved in climate disinformation after student protest.[213] Princeton is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[214]\n\n\nPrinceton's Sustainability Action Plan also aims to have zero waste through recycling programs, sustainable purchasing, and behavioral and operational strategies.[215]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance and structure[edit]\n\n\n![An image that shows Christopher Eisgruber signing a paper](image)Christopher Eisgruber, the 20th and current president of the university\nPrinceton's 20th and current president is Christopher Eisgruber, who was appointed by the university's board of trustees in 2013.[130] The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members at any one time, with the president of the university and the Governor of New Jersey serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university's endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.[216]\n\n\nThe university is composed of the Undergraduate College, the Graduate School, the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of Public and International Affairs.[217] Additionally, the school's Bendheim Center for Finance provides education for the area of money and finance in lieu of a business school.[218] Princeton did host a Princeton Law School for a short period, before eventually closing in 1852 due to poor income.[219] Princeton's lack of other professional schools can be attributed to a university focus on undergraduates.[220]\n\n\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study,[221] Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[222] Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities,[223] the Universities Research Association,[224] and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[225] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.[226]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton University's endowment of $37 billion (per 2021 figures) was ranked as the fourth largest endowment in the United States,[227] and it had the greatest per-student endowment in the world at over $4.4 million per student.[228][229] The endowment is sustained through continued donations and is maintained by investment advisers.[230] Princeton's operating budget is over $2 billion per year, with 50% going to academic departments and programs, 33% to administrative and student service departments, 10% to financial aid departments, and 7% to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.[231]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus\nPrinceton follows a liberal arts curriculum,[220] and offers two bachelor's degrees to students: a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).[217] Typically, A.B. students choose a major (called a concentration) at the end of sophomore year, while B.S.E. students declare at the end of their freshman year.[232] Students must complete distribution requirements, departmental requirements, and independent work to graduate with either degree.[220][217] A.B. students must complete distribution requirements in literature and the arts, science and engineering, social analysis, cultural difference, epistemology and cognition, ethical thought and moral values, historical analysis, and quantitative and computational reasoning; they must also have satisfactory ability in a foreign language.[217] Additionally, they must complete two papers of independent work during their junior year—known as the junior papers—and craft a senior thesis to graduate;[233][234] both revolve around the concentration they are pursuing.[235] B.S.E. majors complete fewer courses in the humanities and social sciences and instead fulfill requirements in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer programming.[217] They likewise must complete independent work, which typically involves a design project or senior thesis, but not the junior papers.[233][235] A.B. majors must complete 31 courses, whereas B.S.E. majors must complete 36 courses.[236]\n\n\nStudents can choose from either 36 concentrations or create their own. They can also participate in 55 interdisciplinary certificate programs;[217] since Princeton does not offer an academic minor, the certificates effectively serve as one.[237] Course structure is determined by the instructor and department. Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses.[238] The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student.[238][239] The average class meeting time is 3–4 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course.[238] The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1,[239] and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students.[234] In the *Fiske Guide to Colleges*, academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"[69]\n\n\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates.[240] The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.[241] Violations pertaining to all other academic work fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.[242] Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not plagiarized the work.[243]\n\n\n\n#### Grade deflation policy[edit]\n\n\nThe first focus on issues of grade inflation by the Princeton administration began in 1998 when a university report was released showcasing a steady rise in undergraduate grades from 1973 to 1997.[244][245] Subsequent reports and discussion from the report culminated to when in 2004,[244] Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the dean of the college, implemented a grade deflation policy to address the findings.[246] Malkiel's reason for the policy was that an A was becoming devalued as a larger percentage of the student body received one.[246] Following its introduction, the number of A's and average GPA on campus dropped, although A's and B's were still the most frequent grades awarded.[245][247] The policy received mixed approval from both faculty and students when first instituted.[244][248] Criticism for grade deflation continued through the years, with students alleging negative effects like increased competition and lack of willingness to choose challenging classes.[246][249] Other criticism included job market and graduate school prospects, although Malkiel responded by saying that she sent 3,000 letters to numerous institutions and employers informing them.[245][246] In 2009, transcripts began including a statement about the policy.[250]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber created a faculty committee to review the deflation policy.[250] In August 2014, the committee released a report recommending the removal of the policy and instead develop consistent standards for grading across individual departments.[251] In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed in response to the report.[252] In a 2020 analysis of undergraduate grades following the removal of a policy, there were no long-lasting effects, with the percent of students receiving A's higher than in 1998.[253]\n\n\n\n### Graduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cleveland Tower, part of the Princeton University Graduate College\nFor the 2019–2020 academic year, the Graduate School enrolled 2,971 students. Approximately 40% of the students were female, 42% were international, and 35% of domestic students were a member of a U.S. minority group. The average time to complete a doctoral degree was 5.7 years.[254] The university awarded 318 Ph.D. degrees and 174 final master's degrees for the 2019–2020 academic year.[254]\n\n\nThe Graduate School offers degrees in 42 academic departments and programs, which span the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.[254][217] Doctoral education is available for all departments while master's degrees are only available in the architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy departments.[255] Doctoral education focuses on original, independent scholarship whereas master's degrees focus more on career preparation in both public life and professional practice. Graduate students can also concentrate in an interdisciplinary program and be granted a certificate. Joint degrees are available for several disciplines, as are dual M.D./Ph.D. or M.P.A./J.D. programs.[217][d]\n\n\nStudents in the graduate school can participate in regional cross-registration agreements, domestic exchanges with other Ivy League schools and similar institutions, and in international partnerships and exchanges.[256]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| Liberal arts |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[257] | 1 |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[258] | 5 |\n| *Forbes*[259] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[260] | 1 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[261] | 5 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[262] | 1 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[263] | 6 |\n| *QS*[264] | 17 |\n| *THE*[265] | 7 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[266] | 16 |\n\n\nPrinceton ranked first in the 2021 *U.S. News* rankings for the tenth consecutive year.[267][268] Princeton ranked fourth for undergrad teaching for 2021, falling from first place in the 2020 rankings.[268] In the 2022 *Times Higher Education* assessment of the world's best universities, Princeton was ranked 7th.[269] In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, it was ranked 20th overall in the world.[270]\n\n\nIn the 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* \"Graduate School Rankings,\" 13 of Princeton's 14 graduate programs were ranked in their respective top 10 (with Engineering 22nd), 7 of them in the top 5, and two in the top spot (Economics and Mathematics).[271]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and College Pulse selected Princeton as its top university in its \"2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.\" ranking.[272]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[273] Based on data for the 2020 fiscal year, the university received approximately $250 million in sponsored research for its main campus, with 81.4% coming from the government, 12.1% from foundations, 5.5% from industry, and 1.0% from private and other. An additional $120 million in sponsored research was for the Plasma Physics Lab; the main campus and the lab combined totaled to $370 million for sponsored research.[274] Based on 2017 data, the university ranked 72nd among 902 institutions for research expenditures.[275]\n\n\nBased on 2018 data, Princeton's National Academy Membership totaled to 126, ranking 9th in the nation.[276] The university hosts 75 research institutes and centers and two national laboratories.[277] Princeton is a member of the New Jersey Space Grant Consortium.[278]\n\n\n\n#### Library system[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Firestone Library](image)Firestone Library, the largest of Princeton's librariesThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings,[279] including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the country.[14] Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences.[279] Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*[280] and George F. Kennan's Long Telegram.[281] In addition to Firestone library, specialized libraries exist for architecture, art and archaeology, East Asian studies, engineering, music, public and international affairs, public policy and university archives, and the sciences.[282] The library system provides access to subscription-based electronic resources and databases to students.[283]\n\n\n#### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion.[284] Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.[284] Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.[285]\n\n\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling.[286][287] Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.[286]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[288]Change vs.2017[289]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 5.6% (![Neutral decrease](image) −1.6)\n |\n| Yield rate | 69.1% (![Steady](image) −0.7)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 760 |\n| SAT Math | 790 (![Increase](image) +40 median)\n |\n| ACT Composite | 35 (![Increase](image) +2 median)\n |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.95 (![Increase](image) +0.04)\n |\n|  |\n\nPrinceton offers several methods to apply: the Common Application, the Coalition Application, and the QuestBridge Application.[290][291] Princeton's application requires several writing supplements and submitting a graded written paper.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 5.8% of undergraduate applicants in the 2019–2020 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2024).[3] The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1470–1560, the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 33–35, and the average high school GPA was a 3.91.[3] For graduate admissions, in the 2021–2022 academic year, Princeton received 12,553 applications for admission and accepted 1,322 applicants, with a yield rate of 51%.[254]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Princeton used an ABC system to function as a precursory early program, where admission officers would visit feeder schools and assign A, B, or C ratings to students.[292][e] From 1977 to 1995, Princeton employed an early action program, and in 1996, transitioned to an early decision program.[293] In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, ending the school's early decision program.[294] In February 2011, following decisions by the University of Virginia and Harvard University to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute a single-choice early action option for applicants,[293] which it still uses.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton reinstated its transfer students program in 2018 after a three decade moratorium; the program encourages applicants from low-income families, the military, and community colleges.[295][296]\n\n\n\n### Costs and financial aid[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2021–2022 academic year, the total cost of attendance is $77,690.[297] 61% of all undergraduates receive financial aid, with the average financial aid grant being $57,251.[3] Tuition, room, and board is free for families making up to $65,000, and financial aid is offered to families making up to $180,000.[298] In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate the use of student loans in financial aid, replacing them with grants.[126][69] In addition, all admissions are need-blind, and financial aid meets 100% of demonstrated financial need.[299] The university does not use academic or athletic merit scholarships.[300] In September 2022, Princeton announced that it would cover all costs for families earning $100,000 a year or less, with reduced costs for higher income families as well.[301]\n\n\n*Kiplinger* magazine in 2019 ranked Princeton as the fifth best value school in a combined list comparing private universities, private liberal arts colleges, and public colleges, noting that the average graduating debt was $9,005.[302] For its 2021 rankings, the *U.S. News & World Report* ranked it second in its category for \"Best Value Schools.\"[268]\n\n\n\n## Student life and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nThe university guarantees housing for students for all four years,[303] with more than 98% of undergraduates living on campus.[304] Freshman and sophomores are required to live on campus, specifically in one of the university's six residential colleges. Once put into a residential college, students have an upperclassmen residential college adviser to adjust to college life and a faculty academic adviser for academic guidance.[305] Upperclassmen are given the option to keep living in the college or decide to move into upperclassmen dorms;[304] upperclassmen still remain affiliated with their college even if they live somewhere else.[69]\n\n\nEach residential college has its own distinct layout and architecture.[305] Additionally, each college has its own faculty head, dean, director of studies, and director of student life. The colleges feature various amenities, such as dining halls, common rooms, laundry rooms, academic spaces, and arts and entertainment resources. Three of the colleges house students from all classes while the other three house only underclassmen.[306]\n\n\nPrinceton's residential college system dates back to when university president Woodrow Wilson's proposed the creation of quadrangles.[82] While the plan was vetoed,[82] it eventually made a resurgence with the creation of Wilson Lodge (now known as First College) in 1957 to provide an alternative to the eating clubs.[307] Wilson Lodge was dedicated as Wilson College in 1968 and served as an experiment for the residential college system. In 2020, Princeton University elected to change the name of Wilson College to First College after the recent deaths involving police brutality of black individuals.[308] When enrollment increased in the 1970s, a university report in 1979 recommended the establishment of five residential colleges.[309] Funding was raised within a year,[310] leading to the development of Rockefeller College (1982), Mathey College (1983), Butler College (1983), and Forbes College (1984).[307] Whitman College was founded and constructed in 2007 at a cost of $100 million.[311] Butler's dorms were demolished in 2007 and a new complex was built in 2009.[312] Butler and Mathey previously acted as only underclassmen colleges, but transitioned to four-year colleges in fall 2009.[313] Princeton completed and opened two new residential colleges—Yeh College and New College West—at the beginning of the academic year in September 2022.[314][f] The university plans to construct a new residential college named Hobson College where First College currently stands.[316]\n\n\n\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known as the Graduate College, located on a hill about half a mile from the main campus.[317][g] The location of the Graduate College was the result of a dispute between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean Andrew Fleming West. Wilson preferred a central location for the college; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus, and ultimately, he prevailed.[319] The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate Gothic section crowned by Cleveland Tower,[317] a memorial tower for former Princeton trustee Grover Cleveland.[320][321] The tower also has 67 carillon bells, making it one of the largest carillons in the world.[322] The attached New Graduate College provides a modern contrast in architectural style to the gothic Old Graduate College.[323] Graduate students also have the option of living in student apartments.[324]\n\n* ![A picture of First College](image)\n\nFirst College (founded 1957)\n* ![A picture of Forbes College](image)\n\nForbes College (founded 1984)\n* ![The exterior of Mathey College, specifically Blair Arch.](image)\n\nMathey College (founded 1983)\n* ![A picture of Rockefeller College](image)\n\nRockefeller College (founded 1982)\n* ![A picture showcasing the entrance to Butler College](image)\n\nButler College (founded 1983)\n* ![The exterior of Whitman College.](image)\n\nWhitman College (founded 2007)\n\n\n### Eating clubs and dining[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eating clubs at Princeton University\n\n![A picture of Ivy Club, the oldest eating club on campus](image)Founded in 1879, Ivy Club is the oldest and wealthiest eating club on campus\nEach residential college has a dining hall for students in the college, and they vary in their environment and food served.[325][326] Upperclassmen who no longer live in the college can choose from a variety of options: join an eating club and choose a shared meal plan; join a dining co-op, where groups of students eat, prepare, and cook food together; or organize their own dining.[325] The university offers kosher dining through the Center for Jewish Life and halal dining options for Muslim students in the dining halls.[325]\n\n\nSocial life takes place primarily on campus and is involved heavily with one's residential college or eating club.[303][151] Residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, ranging from Broadway show outings to regular barbecues.[305] Eating clubs, while not affiliated with the university, are co-ed organizations that serve as social centers, host events, and invite guest speakers.[327][69] Additionally, they serve as a place of community for upperclassmen.[327][151] Five of the clubs have first-serve memberships called \"sign-ins\" and six clubs use a selective process, in which students must \"bicker.\"[328] This requires prospective members to undergo an interviewing process.[329] Each eating club has a fee to join which ranges from around $9,000 to $10,000. As a result, Princeton increases financial aid for upperclassmen, and the eating clubs also offer financial assistance.[330][331] Cumulatively, there are ten clubs located on Prospect Avenue—Cannon, Cap and Gown, Charter, Cloister, Colonial, Cottage, Ivy, Quadrangle, Tiger, and Tower—and one located on Washington Road—Terrace.[332][328] 68% of upperclassmen are members of a club, with each one containing around 150 to 200 students[328]\n\n\n\n### Campus organizations[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton hosts around 500 recognized student organizations and several campus centers.[304]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Government (USG) serves as Princeton's student government.[333] The USG funds student organization events, sponsors campus events, and represents the undergraduate student body when convening with faculty and administration.[333]\n\n\n\n![A picture of Whig Hall](image)Whig Hall, where the American Whig-Cliosophic Society resides.\nFounded in about 1765, the American Whig-Cliosophic Society is the nation's oldest collegiate political, literary, and debate society,[334][151] and is the largest and oldest student organization on campus.[335] The Whig-Clio Society has several subsidiary organizations, each specialized to different areas of politics: the Princeton Debate Panel, International Relations Council, Princeton Mock Trial, and Princeton Model Congress.[336] The International Relations Council manages two Model United Nations conferences: the Princeton Diplomatic Invitational (PDI) for collegiate competition and the Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC) for high school competition.[337]\n\n\nThere are several publications on campus and a radio station. Founded in 1876, *The Daily Princetonian*, otherwise known as *The Prince*, is the second oldest college daily student newspaper in the United States.[338][339] Other publications include *The Nassau Literary Review*,[340] the *Princeton Tory*, a campus journal of conservative thought,[341] *The Princeton Diplomat*, the only student-run magazine on global affairs,[342] the *Princeton Political Review*, the only multi-partisan political publication on campus,[343] and the recently revived *Princeton Progressive*, the only left-leaning political publication on campus,[344][345] among others. Princeton's WPRB (103.3 FM) radio station is the oldest licensed college radio station in the nation.[151]\n\n\n\n![A picture of McCarter Theatre](image)The McCarter Theatre, where the Princeton Triangle Club premiers its Triangle Show.[346]\nPrinceton is home to a variety of performing arts and music groups. Many of the groups are represented by the Performing Arts Council.[347] Dating back to 1883, the Princeton Triangle Club is America's oldest touring musical-comedy theater group.[348][349] It performs its annual Triangle Show every fall at the 1,000 seat McCarter Theatre,[350][346] as well as original musical comedies, revues, and other shows throughout campus.[349] Princeton's oldest choir is the Glee Club, which began in 1874.[351] The comedic scramble Tiger Band was formed in 1919 and plays at halftime shows and other events.[352] Other groups include the Princeton University Orchestra, the flagship symphony orchestra group founded in 1896,[353] and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra,[354] both of which perform at Alexander Hall.[355][353]\n\n\nA cappella groups are a staple of campus life, with many holding concerts, informal shows, and arch sings.[351][356] Arch sings are where a cappella performances are held in one of Princeton's many gothic arches. The oldest a cappella ensemble is the Nassoons, which were formed in 1941. All-male groups include the Tigertones (1946) and Footnotes (1959); all-female groups include the Tigerlilies (1971), Tigressions (1981), Wildcats (1987); the oldest coed a cappella group in the Ivy League is the Princeton Katzenjammers (1973), which was followed by the Roaring 20 (1983) and Shere Khan (1994).[356]\n\n\nPrinceton features several campus centers for students that provide resources and information for students with certain identities. These include the Center for Jewish Life, the Davis International Center, the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, the Women's Center, and the LGBT Center. The Frist Campus Center and the Campus Club are additional facilities for the entire campus community that hold various activities and events.[304]\n\n\nPrinceton features 15 chaplaincies and multiple religious student groups. The following faiths are represented on campus: Baha'i, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Unitarian Universalism.[357]\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton students partake in a wide variety of campus traditions, both past and present.[358] \n\n![A picture of FitzRandolph Gates](image)FitzRandolph Gates, which by tradition undergraduates do not exit until graduation.Current traditions Princeton students celebrate include the ceremonial bonfire, which takes place on the Cannon Green behind Nassau Hall. It is held only if Princeton beats both Harvard University and Yale University at football in the same season.[359] Another tradition is the use of traditional college cheers at events and reunions, like the \"Locomotive\", which dates back to before 1894.[360][361] Princeton students abide by the tradition of never exiting the campus through FitzRandolph Gates until one graduates. According to tradition, anyone who exits campus before their graduation will not graduate.[362][363] A more controversial tradition is Newman's Day, where some students attempt to drink 24 beers in the 24 hours of April 24. According to *The New York Times*, \"the day got its name from an apocryphal quote attributed to Paul Newman: '24 beers in a case, 24 hours in a day. Coincidence? I think not.'\"[364] Newman has spoken out against the tradition.[364] One of the biggest traditions celebrated annually are Reunions, which are massive annual gatherings of alumni.[365] At Reunions, a traditional parade of alumni and their families, known as the \"P-rade\", process through the campus.[366]\n\n\nPrinceton also has several traditions that have faded into the past. One of them was clapper theft, the act of climbing to the top of Nassau Hall to steal the bell clapper, which rings to signal the start of classes on the first day of the school year. For safety reasons, the clapper was permanently removed.[367] Another was the Nude Olympics, an annual nude and partially nude frolic in Holder Courtyard that used to take place during the first snow of the winter. Started in the early 1970s, the Nude Olympics went co-educational in 1979 and gained much notoriety with the American press. Due to issues of sexual harassment and safety reasons, the administration banned the Olympics in 2000 to the disappointment of students.[368][369]\n\n\n\n### Alma mater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nOld Nassau\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Old Nassau\" has been Princeton University's school song since 1859, when it was written that year by freshman Harlan Page Peck. It was originally published in the *Nassau Literary Magazine*, where it won the magazine's prize for best college song. After an unsuccessful attempt at singing it to *Auld Lang Syne'*s melody, Karl Langlotz, a Princeton professor, wrote the music for it.[370] In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of \"Old Nassau\" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.[371]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nTiger Transit is the bus system of the university, mostly open to the public and linking university campuses and areas around Princeton.[372] NJ Transit provides bus service on the 600, 606 and 609 lines and rail service on the Dinky, a small commuter train that provides service to the Princeton Junction Station.[373] Coach USA, through their subsidiary Suburban Transit, provides bus service to New York City and other destinations in New Jersey.[373]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[374] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Foreign national | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Hispanic | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[h] | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[i] | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Affluent[j] | 77%\n | 77 |\n\n\nPrinceton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2021 admitted freshman class was one of the most diverse in the school's history, with 68% of students identifying as students of color.[375] The university has worked to increase its enrollment of first-generation and low-income students in recent years.[376] The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 72% of students coming from the top 20% highest-earning families.[377] In 2017, 22% of freshman qualified for federal Pell Grants, above the 16% average for the top 150 schools ranked by the *U.S. News & World Report*; nationwide, the average was 44%.[378] Based on data in a 2019 article in *The Daily Princetonian,* 10% of students hail from *Bloomberg's* 2018 list of \"100 richest places\", and that the top 20% of high schools send as many students to Princeton as the bottom 80%.[379]\n\n\nIn 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other Ivy League schools. 16% of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted *The Daily Princetonian* to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. *The New York Observer* wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the *Observer*, several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns.[380] As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students.[381]\n\n\nStarting in 1967, African American enrollment surged from 1.7% to 10% but has stagnated ever since.[382] Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first African American, however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that \"a member of your race might feel very much alone\" at Princeton University.[383] Princeton would not admit its first Black students until in 1945 when Princeton instituted the V-12 program on campus.[384] In 1947, John L. Howard, one of the four naval cadets admitted to the program, would become the first Black student to graduate with a bachelor's degree.[385][386]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of a tiger statue on Princeton's campus](image)Princeton's mascot is the tiger.\nPrinceton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides \"a variety of physical education and recreational programs\" for members of the Princeton community.[387] Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.[388] Princeton's colors are orange and black.[389] The school's athletes are known as the *Tigers*, and the mascot is a tiger.[389][390] The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.[391]\n\n\n\n### Varsity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Princeton Tigers\n\n![A picture showing a football match between Princeton University and Lehigh University in September 2007](image)Princeton vs. Lehigh football, September 2007\nPrinceton hosts 37 men's and women's varsity sports.[388] Princeton is an NCAA Division I school, with its athletic conference being the Ivy League.[389] Its rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges, and its men's volleyball team competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.[392] Princeton's sailing team, though a club sport, competes at the varsity level in the MAISA conference of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.[393]\n\n\nPrinceton's football team competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I with the rest of the Ivy League.[394] Princeton played against Rutgers University in the first intercollegiate football game in the U.S. on November 6, 1869; Rutgers won the game.[395] From 1877 until at least 1903, Princeton played football using rugby rules.[396]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Princeton claims 28 national football championships, which would make it the most of any school, although the NCAA only recognizes 15 of the wins.[397][398] With its last win being in 2018, Princeton has won 12 Ivy League championships.[399] In 1951, Dick Kazmaier won Princeton its only Heisman Trophy, the last to come from the Ivy League.[400]\n\n\nThe men's basketball program is noted for its success under Pete Carril, the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 NCAA tournament appearances.[401] Carril introduced the Princeton offense, an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.[401][402] Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat UCLA, the defending national champion, in the opening round of the 1996 NCAA tournament.[401] On December 14, 2005, Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth University.[403]\n\n\nPrinceton women's soccer team advanced to the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship semi-finals in 2004, becoming the first Ivy League team to do so in a 64 team setting.[404][405] The men's soccer team was coached from 1984 to 1995 by Princeton alumnus and future United States men's national team manager Bob Bradley, who lead the Tigers to win two Ivy League titles and make an appearance at the NCAA Final Four in 1993.[406] Princeton's men's lacrosse program undertook a period of notable success from 1992 to 2001, during which time it won six national championships.[407] In 2012, its field hockey team became the first in the Ivy League to win a national championship.[408]\n\n\nPrinceton has won at least one Ivy League title every year since 1957, and it became the first university in its conference to win over 500 Ivy League athletic championships.[408] From 1896 to 2018, 113 athletes from Princeton have competed in the Olympics, winning 19 gold medals, 24 silver medals, and 23 bronze medals.[409]\n\n\n\n### Club and intramural[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The annual Cane Spree depicted in 1877\nIn addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts 37 club sports teams, which are open to all Princeton students of any skill level.[410] Teams compete against other collegiate teams both in the Northeast and nationally.[410] The intramural sports program is also available on campus, which schedules competitions between residential colleges, eating clubs, independent groups, students, and faculty and staff.[304][411] Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.[412]\n\n\nIn the fall, freshman and sophomores participate in the intramural athletic competition called Cane Spree. Although the event centers on cane wrestling, freshman and sophomores compete in other sports and competitions. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.[413]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Princeton University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton University as alumni or faculty.\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain category: Princeton University alumni\n\nU.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson and Vice Presidents George M.

Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date and the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899 its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.[10][11] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a Log College was operated by William and Gilbert Tennent, the Presbyterian ministers, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746 and it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. However, Princeton has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts \"do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[12] Columbia University was chartered and began collegiate classes in 1754. Columbia considers itself to be the fifth institution of higher learning in the United States, based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[13]\n2. **^** The strike was part of the broader Student Strike of 1970.\n3. **^** 505 women applied to join the Princeton freshman class.[147]\n4. **^** The M.D./Ph.D. is granted in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the Rutgers–New Brunswick Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  **College of New Jersey**, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8][9][a] The institution moved to Newark in 1747, and then to the current site nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.\n\n\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its 600 acres (2.4 km2) main campus. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and has one of the largest university libraries in the world.[14]\n\n\nPrinceton uses a residential college system and is known for its upperclassmen eating clubs. The university has over 500 student organizations. Princeton students embrace a wide variety of traditions from both the past and present. The university is a NCAA Division I school and competes in the Ivy League. The school's athletic team, the Princeton Tigers, has won the most titles in its conference and has sent many students and alumni to the Olympics.\n\n\nAs of October 2021, 75 Nobel laureates, 16 Fields Medalists and 16 Turing Award laureates have been affiliated with Princeton University as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, Princeton has been associated with 21 National Medal of Science awardees, 5 Abel Prize awardees, 11 National Humanities Medal recipients, 217 Rhodes Scholars, 137 Marshall Scholars, and\n62 Gates Cambridge Scholars. Two U.S. presidents, twelve U.S. Supreme Court Justices (three of whom currently serve on the court) and numerous living industry and media tycoons and foreign heads of state are all counted among Princeton's alumni body. Princeton has graduated many members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Cabinet, including eight Secretaries of State, three Secretaries of Defense and two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Princeton University\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![A drawing of the Log College](image)The Log College, an influential aspect of Princeton's development\nPrinceton University, founded as the College of New Jersey, was shaped much in its formative years by the \"Log College\", a seminary founded by the Reverend William Tennent at Neshaminy, Pennsylvania, in about 1726. While no legal connection ever existed, many of the pupils and adherents from the Log College would go on to financially support and become substantially involved in the early years of the university.[12] While early writers considered it as the predecessor of the university,[15] the idea has been rebuked by Princeton historians.[16][12]\n\n\nThe founding of the university itself originated from a split in the Presbyterian church following the Great Awakening.[17] In 1741, New Light Presbyterians were expelled from the Synod of Philadelphia in defense of how the Log College ordained ministers.[18] The four founders of the College of New Jersey, who were New Lights, were either expelled or withdrew from the Synod and devised a plan to establish a new college, for they were disappointed with Harvard and Yale's opposition to the Great Awakening and dissatisfied with the limited instruction at the Log College.[18][17] They convinced three other Presbyterians to join them and decided on New Jersey as the location for the college, as at the time, there was no institution between Yale College in New Haven, Connecticut, and the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia; it was also where some of the founders preached.[19] Although their initial request was rejected by the Anglican governor Lewis Morrison, the acting governor after Morrison's death, John Hamilton, granted a charter for the College of New Jersey on October 22, 1746.[20][19] In 1747, approximately five months after acquiring the charter, the trustees elected Jonathan Dickinson as president and opened in Elizabeth, New Jersey,[20] where classes were held in Dickinson's parsonage.[21] With its founding, it became the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, and one of nine colonial colleges charted before the American Revolution.[8][9] The founders aimed for the college to have an expansive curriculum to teach people of various professions, not solely ministerial work.[22][20] Though the school was open to those of any religious denomination,[23] with many of the founders being of Presbyterian faith, the college became the educational and religious capital of Scotch-Irish Presbyterian America.[24]\n\n\n\n### Colonial and early years[edit]\n\n\n![An engraving of Nassau Hall from 1760](image)From 1760, the first picture of Nassau Hall\nIn 1747, following the death of then President Jonathan Dickinson, the college moved from Elizabeth to Newark, New Jersey, as that was where presidential successor Aaron Burr Sr.'s parsonage was located.[20] That same year, Princeton's first charter came under dispute by Anglicans, but on September 14, 1748, the recently appointed governor Jonathan Belcher granted a second charter.[25][26] Belcher, a Congregationalist, had become alienated from his alma mater, Harvard, and decided to \"adopt\" the infant college.[25][23] Belcher would go on to raise funds for the college and donate his 474-volume library, making it one of the largest libraries in the colonies.[25][27]\n\n\n\nIn 1756, the college moved again to its present home in Princeton, New Jersey, because Newark was felt to be too close to New York.[28][29] Princeton was chosen for its central location in New Jersey and by strong recommendation by Belcher.[25][30] The college's home in Princeton was Nassau Hall, named for the royal William III of England, a member of the House of Orange-Nassau.[31] The trustees of the College of New Jersey initially suggested that Nassau Hall be named in recognition of Belcher because of his interest in the institution; the governor vetoed the request.[25] \n\n![A portrait of John Witherspoon](image)John Witherspoon, President of the college (1768–94) and signer of the Declaration of Independence\nBurr, who would die in 1757, devised a curriculum for the school and enlarged the student body.[32] Following the untimely death of Burr and the college's next three presidents,[33] John Witherspoon became president in 1768 and remained in that post until his death in 1794.[34] With his presidency, Witherspoon focused the college on preparing a new generation of both educated clergy and secular leadership in the new American nation.[35][36] To this end, he tightened academic standards, broadened the curriculum, solicited investment for the college, and grew its size.[37][36]\n\n\nA signer of the Declaration of Independence, Witherspoon and his leadership led the college to becoming influential to the American Revolution.[34][38][39] In 1777, the college became the site for the Battle of Princeton.[34] During the battle, British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall before eventually surrendering to American forces led by General George Washington.[40] During the summer and fall of 1783, the Continental Congress and Washington met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months;[41] Nassau Hall is where Congress learned of the peace treaty between the colonies and the British.[42][43] The college did suffer from the revolution, with a depreciated endowment and hefty repair bills for Nassau Hall.[44]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1795, President Samuel Stanhope Smith took office, the first alumnus to become president.[45] Nassau Hall suffered a large fire that destroyed its interior in 1802, which Smith blamed on rebellious students.[46] The college raised funds for reconstruction, as well as the construction of two new buildings.[47] In 1807, a large student riot occurred at Nassau Hall, spurred by underlying distrust of educational reforms by Smith away from the Church.[45][48] Following Smith's mishandling of the situation, falling enrollment, and faculty resignations, the trustees of the university offered resignation to Smith, which he accepted.[47] In 1812, Ashbel Green was unanimously elected by the trustees of the college to become the eighth president.[49] After the liberal tenure of Smith, Green represented the conservative \"Old Side,\" in which he introduced rigorous disciplinary rules and heavily embraced religion.[50][51] Even so, believing the college was not religious enough, he took a prominent role in establishing the Princeton Theological Seminary next door.[50][49] While student riots were a frequent occurrence during Green's tenure, enrollment did increase under his administration.[52]\n\n\n\nIn 1823, James Carnahan became president, arriving as an unprepared and timid leader.[53][54] With the college riven by conflicting views between students, faculty, and trustees, and enrollment hitting its lowest in years, Carnahan considered closing the university.[53] Carnahan's successor, John Maclean Jr., who was only a professor at the time, recommended saving the university with the help of alumni; as a result, Princeton's alumni association, led by James Madison, was created and began raising funds.[53][55] With Carnahan and Maclean, now vice-president, working as partners, enrollment and faculty increased, tensions decreased, and the college campus expanded.[55] Maclean took over the presidency in 1854, and led the university through the American Civil War.[56] When Nassau Hall burned down again in 1855,[57] Maclean raised funds and used the money to rebuild Nassau Hall and run the university on an austerity budget during the war years.[56] With a third of students from the college being from the South, enrollment fell.[58] Once many of the Southerners left, the campus became a sharp proponent for the Union,[59] even bestowing an honorary degree to President Lincoln.[60]\n\n![A portrait of James McCosh](image)James McCosh, President of the college (1868–88)James McCosh became the college's president in 1868, and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the war.[61] During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, recruited distinguished faculty, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic style to the campus.[61][62] McCosh's tenure also saw the creation and rise of many extracurricular activities, like the Princeton Glee Club, the Triangle Club, the first intercollegiate football team, and the first permanent eating club,[63] as well as the elimination of fraternities and sororities.[64] In 1879, Princeton conferred its first doctorates on James F. Williamson and William Libby, both members of the Class of 1877.[65]\n\n\nFrancis Patton took the presidency in 1888, and although his election was not met by unanimous enthusiasm, he was well received by undergraduates.[66] Patton's administration was marked with great change, for Princeton's enrollment and faculty had doubled. At the same time, the college underwent large expansion and social life was changing in reflection of the rise in eating clubs and burgeoning interest in athletics.[67] In 1893, the honor system was established, allowing for unproctored exams.[68][69] In 1896, the college officially became a university,[70] and as a result, it officially changed its name to Princeton University.[71] In 1900, the Graduate School was formally established.[70] Even with such accomplishments, Patton's administration remained lackluster with its administrative structure[72] and towards its educational standards.[68] Due to profile changes in the board of trustees and dissatisfaction with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1902.[72]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Woodrow Wilson as president of Princeton](image)Woodrow Wilson, President of Princeton University (1902–10) and 28th president of the United States\nFollowing Patton's resignation, Woodrow Wilson, an alumnus and popular professor, was elected the 13th president of the university.[73][74] Noticing falling academic standards, Wilson orchestrated significant changes to the curriculum, where freshman and sophomores followed a unified curriculum while juniors and seniors concentrated study in one discipline.[75] Ambitious seniors were allowed to undertake independent work, which would eventually shape Princeton's emphasis on the practice for the future.[76] Wilson further reformed the educational system by introducing the preceptorial system in 1905,[75] a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.[77] The changes brought about many new faculty and cemented Princeton's academics for the first half of the 20th century.[78] Due to the tightening of academic standards, enrollment declined severely until 1907.[75] In 1906, the reservoir Lake Carnegie was created by Andrew Carnegie,[79] and the university officially became nonsectarian.[80] Before leaving office, Wilson strengthened the science program to focus on \"pure\" research and broke the Presbyterian lock on the board of trustees.[73][81] However, he did fail in winning support for the permanent location of the Graduate School and the elimination of the eating clubs, which he proposed replacing with quadrangles, a precursor to the residential college system.[82] Wilson also continued to keep Princeton closed off from accepting Black students.[83] When an aspiring Black student wrote a letter to Wilson, he got his secretary to reply telling him to attend a university where he would be more welcome.[84]\n\n\nJohn Grier Hibben became president in 1912, and would remain in the post for two decades.[85] On October 2, 1913, the Princeton University Graduate College was dedicated.[79] When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Hibben allocated all available University resources to the government. As a result, military training schools opened on campus and laboratories and other facilities were used for research and operational programs. Overall, more than 6,000 students served in the armed forces, with 151 dying during the war.[86] After the war, enrollment spiked and the trustees established the system of selective admission in 1922.[87] From the 1920s to the 1930s, the student body featured many students from preparatory schools, zero Black students, and dwindling Jewish enrollment because of quotas.[88] Aside from managing Princeton during WWI, Hibben introduced the senior thesis in 1923 as a part of The New Plan of Study.[89][90] He also brought about great expansion to the university, with the creation of the School of Architecture in 1919, the School of Engineering in 1921, and the School of Public and International Affairs in 1930.[91] By the end of his presidency, the endowment had increased by 374 percent, the total area of the campus doubled, the faculty experienced impressive growth, and the enrollment doubled.[92][90]\n\n\nHibben's successor, Harold Willis Dodds would lead the university through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Korean Conflict.[93] With the Great Depression, many students were forced to withdraw due to financial reasons.[94] At the same time, Princeton's reputation in physics and mathematics surged as many European scientists left for the United States due to uneasy tension caused by Nazi Germany.[95] In 1930, the Institute for Advanced Study was founded to provide a space for the influx of scientists, such as Albert Einstein.[96] Many Princeton scientists would work on the Manhattan Project during the war, [97] including the entire physics department.[98] During World War II, Princeton offered an accelerated program for students to graduate early before entering the armed forces.[99] Student enrollment fluctuated from month to month, and many faculty were forced to teach unfamiliar subjects. Still, Dodds maintained academic standards and would establish a program for servicemen, so they could resume their education once discharged.[100]\n\n\n\n### 1945 to present[edit]\n\n\nPost-war years saw scholars renewing broken bonds through numerous conventions, expansion of the campus, and the introduction of distribution requirements.[101][102] The period saw the desegregation of Princeton, which was stimulated by changes to the New Jersey constitution.[103] Princeton began undertaking a sharper focus towards research in the years after the war, with the construction of Firestone Library in 1948 and the establishment of the Forrestal Research Center in the 1950s.[104] Government sponsored research increased sharply, particularly in the physics and engineering departments,[105] with much of it occurring at the new Forrestal campus.[106] Though, as the years progressed, scientific research at the Forrestal campus declined, and in 1973, some of the land was converted to commercial and residential spaces.[107]\n\n\nRobert Goheen would succeed Dodds by unanimous vote and serve as president until 1972.[108] Goheen's presidency was characterized as being more liberal than previous presidents, and his presidency would see a rise in Black applicants,[109] as well as the eventual coeducation of the university in 1969.[110] During this period of rising diversity, the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center) was dedicated in 1971.[111] Goheen also oversaw great expansion for the university, with square footage increasing by 80 percentage.[112]\n\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Princeton experienced unprecedented activism, with most of it centered on the Vietnam War.[113][114] While Princeton activism initially remained relatively timid compared to other institutions,[113] protests began to grow with the founding of a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1965, which organized many of the later Princeton protests.[113] In 1966, the SDS gained prominence on campus following picketing against a speech by President Lyndon B. Johnson, which gained frontpage coverage by the *New York Times.*[115][116] A notable point of contention on campus was the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) and would feature multiple protests,[113] some of which required police action.[117] As the years went on, the protests' agenda broadened to investments in South Africa, environmental issues, and women's rights.[113][118] In response to these broadening protests, the Council of the Princeton University Community (CPUC) was founded to serve as a method for greater student voice in governance.[119] Activism culminated in 1970 with a student, faculty, and staff member strike, so the university could become an \"institution against expansion of the war.\"[120][b] Princeton's protests would taper off later that year, with *The* *Daily Princetonian* saying that, \"Princeton 1970–71 was an emotionally burned out university.\"\n\n\nIn 1982, the residential college system was officially established under Goheen's successor William G. Bowen, who would serve until 1988.[121][122] During his presidency, Princeton's endowment increased from $625 million to $2 billion, and a major fundraising drive known as \"A Campaign for Princeton\" was conducted.[122] President Harold T. Shapiro would succeed Bowen and remain president until 2001. Shapiro would continue to increase the endowment, expand academic programs, raise student diversity, and oversee the most renovations in Princeton's history.[123] One of Shapiro's initiatives was the formation of the multidisciplinary Princeton Environmental Institute in 1994, renamed the High Meadows Environmental Institute in 2020.[124][125] In 2001, Princeton shifted the financial aid policy to a system that replaced all loans with grants.[126] That same year, Princeton elected its first female president, Shirley M. Tilghman.[127] Before retiring in 2012, Tilghman expanded financial aid offerings and conducted several major construction projects like the Lewis Center for the Arts and a sixth residential college.[128] Tilghman also lead initiatives for more global programs, the creation of an office of sustainability, and investments into the sciences.[129]\n\n\nPrinceton's 20th and current president Christopher Eisgruber was elected in 2013.[130] In 2017, Princeton University unveiled a large-scale public history and digital humanities investigation into its historical involvement with slavery called the Princeton & Slavery Project. The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project.[131] In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project.[132] In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to Campus sexual assault.[133][134] The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.[135]\n\n\n\n### Coeducation[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton explicitly prohibited the admission of women from its founding in 1746 until 1969. Since it lacked an affiliated women's college, it was often referred to as a \"monastery\", both lovingly and derisively, by members of the Princeton community.[136][137]\nFor about a decade, from 1887 to 1897, nearby Evelyn College for Women was largely comprised of daughters of professors and sisters of Princeton undergraduates. While no legal connection existed, many Princeton professors taught there and several Princeton administrations, like Francis Patton, were on its board of trustees. It closed in 1897 following the death of its founder, Joshua McIlvaine.[138]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pyne Hall, where the first female students lived on campus.\nIn 1947, three female members of the library staff enrolled in beginner Russian courses to deal with an increase in Russian literature in the library.[110]\n\n\nIn 1961, Princeton admitted its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey,[136] who would go on to be the first woman to earn a master's degree at Princeton.[110] Meservey was, at the time of her admission, already a member of the faculty at Douglass College within Princeton. The dean of the graduate school issued a statement clarifying that Meservey's admission was an exception, and that \"Princeton may permit other women in the future as special cases, but does not plan to make general admissions of women graduate students.\"[139] The student-run *Daily Princetonian* ran four articles about Meservey in one issue,[139][140][141][142] including an editorial lamenting the potential \"far reaching implications\" of Meservey's admission which concluded: \"Princeton is unique as an undergraduate men's college and must remain so.\"[142] Eight more women enrolled the following year in the Graduate School.[136] In 1964, T'sai-ying Cheng became the first woman at Princeton to receive a Ph.D. In 1963, five women came to Princeton for one year to study \"critical languages\" as undergraduates, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.[110] Following abortive discussions with Sarah Lawrence College to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the university in 1967,[143] the administration commissioned a report on admitting women. The final report was issued in January 1969, supporting the idea.[110] That same month, Princeton's trustees voted 24–8 in favor of coeducation and began preparing the institution for the transition.[144] The university finished these plans in April 1969 and announced there would be coeducation in September.[145] Ultimately, 101 female freshman and 70 female transfer students enrolled at Princeton in September 1969.[146][145][c] Those admitted were housed in Pyne Hall, a fairly isolated dormitory; a security system was added, although the women deliberately broke it within a day.[148]\n\n\nIn 1971, Mary St. John Douglas and Susan Savage Speers became the first female trustees,[110] and in 1974, quotas for men and women were eliminated.[149] Following a 1979 lawsuit, the eating clubs were required to go coeducational in 1991, after an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.[150] In 2001, Princeton elected its first female president.[127]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Washington Road Elm Allée, which is one of the entrances to the campus](image)The eastern side of the Washington Road Elm Allée, one of the entrances to the campus\nThe main campus consists of more than 200 buildings on 600 acres (2.4 km2) in Princeton, New Jersey.[4] The James Forrestal Campus, a smaller location designed mainly as a research and instruction complex, is split between nearby Plainsboro and South Brunswick. The campuses are situated about one hour from both New York City and Philadelphia on the train.[151] The university also owns more than 520 acres (2.1 km2) of property in West Windsor Township,[4] and is where Princeton is planning to construct a graduate student housing complex, which will be known as \"Lake Campus North\".[152]\n\n\nThe first building on campus was Nassau Hall, completed in 1756, and situated on the northern edge of the campus facing Nassau Street.[153] The campus expanded steadily around Nassau Hall during the early and middle 19th century.[154][155] The McCosh presidency (1868–88) saw the construction of a number of buildings in the High Victorian Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles, although many of them are now gone, leaving the remaining few to appear out of place.[156] At the end of the 19th century, much of Princeton's architecture was designed by the Cope and Stewardson firm (led by the same University of Pennsylvania professors of architecture who designed a large part of Washington University in St. Louis and University of Pennsylvania) resulting in the Collegiate Gothic style for which Princeton is known for today.[157] Implemented initially by William Appleton Potter,[157] and later enforced by the university's supervising architect, Ralph Adams Cram,[158] the Collegiate Gothic style remained the standard for all new building on the Princeton campus until 1960.[159][160] A flurry of construction projects in the 1960s produced a number of new buildings on the south side of the main campus, many of which have been poorly received.[161] Several prominent architects have contributed some more recent additions, including Frank Gehry (Lewis Library),[162] I. M. Pei (Spelman Halls),[163] Demetri Porphyrios (Whitman College, a Collegiate Gothic project),[164] Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown (Frist Campus Center, among several others),[165] Minoru Yamasaki (Robertson Hall),[166] and Rafael Viñoly (Carl Icahn Laboratory).[167]\n\n\nA group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by Alexander Calder (*Five Disks: One Empty*), Jacob Epstein (*Albert Einstein*), Henry Moore (*Oval with Points*), Isamu Noguchi (*White Sun*), and Pablo Picasso (*Head of a Woman*).[168] Richard Serra's *The Hedgehog and The Fox* is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.[169]\n\n\nAt the southern edge of the campus is Lake Carnegie, an artificial lake named for Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie financed the lake's construction in 1906 at the behest of a friend and his brother who were both Princeton alumni.[170] Carnegie hoped the opportunity to take up rowing would inspire Princeton students to forsake football, which he considered \"not gentlemanly.\"[171] The Shea Rowing Center on the lake's shore continues to serve as the headquarters for Princeton rowing.[172]\n\n\nPrinceton's grounds were designed by Beatrix Farrand between 1912 and 1943. Her contributions were most recently recognized with the naming of a courtyard for her.[173] Subsequent changes to the landscape were introduced by Quennell Rothschild & Partners in 2000. In 2005, Michael Van Valkenburgh was hired as the new consulting landscape architect for Princeton's 2016 Campus Plan.[174] Lynden B. Miller was invited to work with him as Princeton's consulting gardening architect, focusing on the 17 gardens that are distributed throughout the campus.[175]\n\n\n\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\n#### Nassau Hall[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building](image)Nassau Hall, the university's oldest building and former capitol of the United States. Pictured in front is Cannon Green.\nNassau Hall is the oldest building on campus. Begun in 1754 and completed in 1756,[176] it was the first seat of the New Jersey Legislature in 1776,[177] was involved in the Battle of Princeton in 1777,[178] and was the seat of the Congress of the Confederation (and thus capitol of the United States) from June 30, 1783, to November 4, 1783.[179] Since 1911, the front entrance has been flanked by two bronze tigers, a gift of the Princeton Class of 1879, which replaced two lions previously given in 1889.[180] Starting in 1922, commencement has been held on the front lawn of Nassau Hall when there is good weather.[181] In 1966, Nassau Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[182] Nowadays, it houses the office of the university president and other administrative offices.[183][184]\n\n\nTo the south of Nassau Hall lies a courtyard that is known as Cannon Green.[185] Buried in the ground at the center is the \"Big Cannon,\" which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the Battle of Princeton. It remained in Princeton until the War of 1812, when it was taken to New Brunswick.[186] In 1836, the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. Two years later, it was moved to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students, and in 1840, it was buried in its current location.[187] A second \"Little Cannon\" is buried in the lawn in front of nearby Whig Hall. The cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of Rutgers University in 1875. The theft ignited the Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the war and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.[187] The protruding cannons are occasionally painted scarlet by Rutgers students who continue the traditional dispute.[188][189]\n\n\n\n#### Art Museum[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Princeton University Art Museum](image)The Princeton University Art Museum, which holds over 112,000 objects\nThough art collection at the university dates back to its very founding, the Princeton University Art Museum was not officially established until 1882 by President McCosh. Its establishment arose from a desire to provide direct access to works of art in a museum for a curriculum in the arts, an education system familiar to many European universities at the time. The museum took on the purposes of providing \"exposure to original works of art and to teach the history of art through an encyclopedic collection of world art.\"[190]\n\n\nNumbering over 112,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and come from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.[191] The museum's art is divided into ten extensive curatorial areas.[192] There is a collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including ceramics, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in Antioch, as well as other art from the ancient Egyptian, Byzantium, and Islamic worlds.[193] The non-Islamic coins were catalogued by Dorothy B. Waage.[194] Medieval Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early Renaissance through the 19th century, with pieces by Monet, Cézanne, and Van Gogh,[195] and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.[196]\n\n\nThe museum features a collection of Chinese and Japanese art, with holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and calligraphy, as well as collections of Korean, Southeast, and Central Asian art.[197] Its collection of pre-Columbian art includes examples of Mayan and Olmec art, and its indigenous art ranges from Chile to Alaska to Greenland.[198] The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings,[199] and it has a comprehensive collection of over 20,000 photographs.[200] Approximately 750 works of African art are represented.[201] The Museum oversees the outside John B. Putnam, Jr., Memorial Collection of Sculpture.[202]\n\n\n\n#### University Chapel[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of the Princeton University Chapel](image)Finished in 1928, the Princeton University Chapel seats 2,000 people.\nThe Princeton University Chapel is located on the north side of campus near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928 at a cost of $2.3 million,[203] approximately $40.8 million adjusted for inflation in 2020. Ralph Adams Cram, the university's supervising architect, designed the chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.[204] At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after King's College Chapel, Cambridge.[205] It underwent a two-year, $10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.[206] The Chapel seats around 2,000 and serves as a site for religious services and local celebrations.[207]\n\n\nMeasured on the exterior, the chapel is 277 feet (84 m) long, 76 feet (23 m) wide at its transepts, and 121 feet (37 m) high.[208] The exterior is Pennsylvania sandstone, trimmed with Indiana limestone, and the interior is made of limestone and Aquia Creek sandstone.[208] The design evokes characteristics of an English church of the Middle Ages.[208] The extensive iconography, in stained glass, stonework, and wood carvings, has the common theme of connecting religion and scholarship.[204]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nPublished in 2008, the Sustainability Action Plan was the first formal plan for sustainability enacted by the university.[209] It focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conservation of resources, and research, education, and civic engagement for sustainability through 10 year objectives.[210][211] Since the 2008 plan, Princeton has aimed at reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels without the purchase of market offsets and predicts to meet the goal by 2026 (the former goal was by 2020 but COVID-19 requirements delayed this).[212] Princeton released its second Sustainability Action Plan in 2019 on Earth Day with its main goal being reducing campus greenhouse gases to net zero by 2046 as well as other objectives building on those in the 2008 plan.[211][212] In 2021, the university agreed to divest from thermal coal and tar sand segments of the fossil fuel industry and from companies that are involved in climate disinformation after student protest.[213] Princeton is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[214]\n\n\nPrinceton's Sustainability Action Plan also aims to have zero waste through recycling programs, sustainable purchasing, and behavioral and operational strategies.[215]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance and structure[edit]\n\n\n![An image that shows Christopher Eisgruber signing a paper](image)Christopher Eisgruber, the 20th and current president of the university\nPrinceton's 20th and current president is Christopher Eisgruber, who was appointed by the university's board of trustees in 2013.[130] The board is responsible for the overall direction of the university. It consists of no fewer than 23 and no more than 40 members at any one time, with the president of the university and the Governor of New Jersey serving as ex officio members. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the university's endowment, and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies such as those in instructional programs and admission as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.[216]\n\n\nThe university is composed of the Undergraduate College, the Graduate School, the School of Architecture, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the School of Public and International Affairs.[217] Additionally, the school's Bendheim Center for Finance provides education for the area of money and finance in lieu of a business school.[218] Princeton did host a Princeton Law School for a short period, before eventually closing in 1852 due to poor income.[219] Princeton's lack of other professional schools can be attributed to a university focus on undergraduates.[220]\n\n\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study,[221] Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[222] Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities,[223] the Universities Research Association,[224] and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[225] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.[226]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton University's endowment of $37 billion (per 2021 figures) was ranked as the fourth largest endowment in the United States,[227] and it had the greatest per-student endowment in the world at over $4.4 million per student.[228][229] The endowment is sustained through continued donations and is maintained by investment advisers.[230] Princeton's operating budget is over $2 billion per year, with 50% going to academic departments and programs, 33% to administrative and student service departments, 10% to financial aid departments, and 7% to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.[231]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Undergraduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McCosh 50, the largest lecture hall on campus\nPrinceton follows a liberal arts curriculum,[220] and offers two bachelor's degrees to students: a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering (B.S.E.).[217] Typically, A.B. students choose a major (called a concentration) at the end of sophomore year, while B.S.E. students declare at the end of their freshman year.[232] Students must complete distribution requirements, departmental requirements, and independent work to graduate with either degree.[220][217] A.B. students must complete distribution requirements in literature and the arts, science and engineering, social analysis, cultural difference, epistemology and cognition, ethical thought and moral values, historical analysis, and quantitative and computational reasoning; they must also have satisfactory ability in a foreign language.[217] Additionally, they must complete two papers of independent work during their junior year—known as the junior papers—and craft a senior thesis to graduate;[233][234] both revolve around the concentration they are pursuing.[235] B.S.E. majors complete fewer courses in the humanities and social sciences and instead fulfill requirements in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer programming.[217] They likewise must complete independent work, which typically involves a design project or senior thesis, but not the junior papers.[233][235] A.B. majors must complete 31 courses, whereas B.S.E. majors must complete 36 courses.[236]\n\n\nStudents can choose from either 36 concentrations or create their own. They can also participate in 55 interdisciplinary certificate programs;[217] since Princeton does not offer an academic minor, the certificates effectively serve as one.[237] Course structure is determined by the instructor and department. Classes vary in their format, ranging from small seminars to medium-sized lecture courses to large lecture courses.[238] The latter two typically have precepts, which are extra weekly discussion sessions that are led by either the professor or a graduate student.[238][239] The average class meeting time is 3–4 hours a week, although this can vary depending on the course.[238] The student to faculty ratio is 5 to 1,[239] and a majority of classes have fewer than 20 students.[234] In the *Fiske Guide to Colleges*, academic culture is considered as \"tight-knit, extremely hardworking, highly cooperative, and supportive.\"[69]\n\n\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates.[240] The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.[241] Violations pertaining to all other academic work fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.[242] Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not plagiarized the work.[243]\n\n\n\n#### Grade deflation policy[edit]\n\n\nThe first focus on issues of grade inflation by the Princeton administration began in 1998 when a university report was released showcasing a steady rise in undergraduate grades from 1973 to 1997.[244][245] Subsequent reports and discussion from the report culminated to when in 2004,[244] Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the dean of the college, implemented a grade deflation policy to address the findings.[246] Malkiel's reason for the policy was that an A was becoming devalued as a larger percentage of the student body received one.[246] Following its introduction, the number of A's and average GPA on campus dropped, although A's and B's were still the most frequent grades awarded.[245][247] The policy received mixed approval from both faculty and students when first instituted.[244][248] Criticism for grade deflation continued through the years, with students alleging negative effects like increased competition and lack of willingness to choose challenging classes.[246][249] Other criticism included job market and graduate school prospects, although Malkiel responded by saying that she sent 3,000 letters to numerous institutions and employers informing them.[245][246] In 2009, transcripts began including a statement about the policy.[250]\n\n\nIn October 2013, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber created a faculty committee to review the deflation policy.[250] In August 2014, the committee released a report recommending the removal of the policy and instead develop consistent standards for grading across individual departments.[251] In October 2014, following a faculty vote, the numerical targets were removed in response to the report.[252] In a 2020 analysis of undergraduate grades following the removal of a policy, there were no long-lasting effects, with the percent of students receiving A's higher than in 1998.[253]\n\n\n\n### Graduate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Cleveland Tower, part of the Princeton University Graduate College\nFor the 2019–2020 academic year, the Graduate School enrolled 2,971 students. Approximately 40% of the students were female, 42% were international, and 35% of domestic students were a member of a U.S. minority group. The average time to complete a doctoral degree was 5.7 years.[254] The university awarded 318 Ph.D. degrees and 174 final master's degrees for the 2019–2020 academic year.[254]\n\n\nThe Graduate School offers degrees in 42 academic departments and programs, which span the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering.[254][217] Doctoral education is available for all departments while master's degrees are only available in the architecture, engineering, finance, and public policy departments.[255] Doctoral education focuses on original, independent scholarship whereas master's degrees focus more on career preparation in both public life and professional practice. Graduate students can also concentrate in an interdisciplinary program and be granted a certificate. Joint degrees are available for several disciplines, as are dual M.D./Ph.D. or M.P.A./J.D. programs.[217][d]\n\n\nStudents in the graduate school can participate in regional cross-registration agreements, domestic exchanges with other Ivy League schools and similar institutions, and in international partnerships and exchanges.[256]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| Liberal arts |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[257] | 1 |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[258] | 5 |\n| *Forbes*[259] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[260] | 1 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[261] | 5 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[262] | 1 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[263] | 6 |\n| *QS*[264] | 17 |\n| *THE*[265] | 7 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[266] | 16 |\n\n\nPrinceton ranked first in the 2021 *U.S. News* rankings for the tenth consecutive year.[267][268] Princeton ranked fourth for undergrad teaching for 2021, falling from first place in the 2020 rankings.[268] In the 2022 *Times Higher Education* assessment of the world's best universities, Princeton was ranked 7th.[269] In the 2022 *QS World University Rankings*, it was ranked 20th overall in the world.[270]\n\n\nIn the 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* \"Graduate School Rankings,\" 13 of Princeton's 14 graduate programs were ranked in their respective top 10 (with Engineering 22nd), 7 of them in the top 5, and two in the top spot (Economics and Mathematics).[271]\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal and College Pulse selected Princeton as its top university in its \"2024 Best Colleges in the U.S.\" ranking.[272]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[273] Based on data for the 2020 fiscal year, the university received approximately $250 million in sponsored research for its main campus, with 81.4% coming from the government, 12.1% from foundations, 5.5% from industry, and 1.0% from private and other. An additional $120 million in sponsored research was for the Plasma Physics Lab; the main campus and the lab combined totaled to $370 million for sponsored research.[274] Based on 2017 data, the university ranked 72nd among 902 institutions for research expenditures.[275]\n\n\nBased on 2018 data, Princeton's National Academy Membership totaled to 126, ranking 9th in the nation.[276] The university hosts 75 research institutes and centers and two national laboratories.[277] Princeton is a member of the New Jersey Space Grant Consortium.[278]\n\n\n\n#### Library system[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of Firestone Library](image)Firestone Library, the largest of Princeton's librariesThe Princeton University Library system houses over 13 million holdings through 11 buildings,[279] including seven million bound volumes, making it one of the largest university libraries in the country.[14] Built in 1948, the main campus library is Firestone Library and serves as the main repository for the humanities and social sciences.[279] Its collections include the autographed manuscript of F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*[280] and George F. Kennan's Long Telegram.[281] In addition to Firestone library, specialized libraries exist for architecture, art and archaeology, East Asian studies, engineering, music, public and international affairs, public policy and university archives, and the sciences.[282] The library system provides access to subscription-based electronic resources and databases to students.[283]\n\n\n#### National laboratories[edit]\n\n\nThe Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) stemmed from Project Matterhorn, a top secret cold war project created in 1951 aimed at achieving controlled nuclear fusion.[284] Princeton astrophysics professor Lyman Spitzer became the first director of the project and remained director until the lab's declassification in 1961 when it received its current name.[284] Today, it is an institute for fusion energy research and plasma physics research.[285]\n\n\nFounded in 1955 and located at Princeton's Forrestal Campus since 1968, the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) conducts climate research and modeling.[286][287] Princeton faculty, research scientists, and graduate scientists can participate in research with the lab.[286]\n\n\n\n## Admissions and financial aid[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Undergraduate admissions statistics |\n| --- |\n| 2022 enteringclass[288]Change vs.2017[289]\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| Admit rate | 5.6% (![Neutral decrease](image) −1.6)\n |\n| Yield rate | 69.1% (![Steady](image) −0.7)\n |\n| Test scores middle 50% |\n| SAT EBRW | 760 |\n| SAT Math | 790 (![Increase](image) +40 median)\n |\n| ACT Composite | 35 (![Increase](image) +2 median)\n |\n| High school GPA |\n| Average | 3.95 (![Increase](image) +0.04)\n |\n|  |\n\nPrinceton offers several methods to apply: the Common Application, the Coalition Application, and the QuestBridge Application.[290][291] Princeton's application requires several writing supplements and submitting a graded written paper.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 5.8% of undergraduate applicants in the 2019–2020 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2024).[3] The middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1470–1560, the middle 50% range of the ACT composite score was 33–35, and the average high school GPA was a 3.91.[3] For graduate admissions, in the 2021–2022 academic year, Princeton received 12,553 applications for admission and accepted 1,322 applicants, with a yield rate of 51%.[254]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Princeton used an ABC system to function as a precursory early program, where admission officers would visit feeder schools and assign A, B, or C ratings to students.[292][e] From 1977 to 1995, Princeton employed an early action program, and in 1996, transitioned to an early decision program.[293] In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool, ending the school's early decision program.[294] In February 2011, following decisions by the University of Virginia and Harvard University to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute a single-choice early action option for applicants,[293] which it still uses.[290]\n\n\nPrinceton reinstated its transfer students program in 2018 after a three decade moratorium; the program encourages applicants from low-income families, the military, and community colleges.[295][296]\n\n\n\n### Costs and financial aid[edit]\n\n\nAs of the 2021–2022 academic year, the total cost of attendance is $77,690.[297] 61% of all undergraduates receive financial aid, with the average financial aid grant being $57,251.[3] Tuition, room, and board is free for families making up to $65,000, and financial aid is offered to families making up to $180,000.[298] In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate the use of student loans in financial aid, replacing them with grants.[126][69] In addition, all admissions are need-blind, and financial aid meets 100% of demonstrated financial need.[299] The university does not use academic or athletic merit scholarships.[300] In September 2022, Princeton announced that it would cover all costs for families earning $100,000 a year or less, with reduced costs for higher income families as well.[301]\n\n\n*Kiplinger* magazine in 2019 ranked Princeton as the fifth best value school in a combined list comparing private universities, private liberal arts colleges, and public colleges, noting that the average graduating debt was $9,005.[302] For its 2021 rankings, the *U.S. News & World Report* ranked it second in its category for \"Best Value Schools.\"[268]\n\n\n\n## Student life and culture[edit]\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nThe university guarantees housing for students for all four years,[303] with more than 98% of undergraduates living on campus.[304] Freshman and sophomores are required to live on campus, specifically in one of the university's six residential colleges. Once put into a residential college, students have an upperclassmen residential college adviser to adjust to college life and a faculty academic adviser for academic guidance.[305] Upperclassmen are given the option to keep living in the college or decide to move into upperclassmen dorms;[304] upperclassmen still remain affiliated with their college even if they live somewhere else.[69]\n\n\nEach residential college has its own distinct layout and architecture.[305] Additionally, each college has its own faculty head, dean, director of studies, and director of student life. The colleges feature various amenities, such as dining halls, common rooms, laundry rooms, academic spaces, and arts and entertainment resources. Three of the colleges house students from all classes while the other three house only underclassmen.[306]\n\n\nPrinceton's residential college system dates back to when university president Woodrow Wilson's proposed the creation of quadrangles.[82] While the plan was vetoed,[82] it eventually made a resurgence with the creation of Wilson Lodge (now known as First College) in 1957 to provide an alternative to the eating clubs.[307] Wilson Lodge was dedicated as Wilson College in 1968 and served as an experiment for the residential college system. In 2020, Princeton University elected to change the name of Wilson College to First College after the recent deaths involving police brutality of black individuals.[308] When enrollment increased in the 1970s, a university report in 1979 recommended the establishment of five residential colleges.[309] Funding was raised within a year,[310] leading to the development of Rockefeller College (1982), Mathey College (1983), Butler College (1983), and Forbes College (1984).[307] Whitman College was founded and constructed in 2007 at a cost of $100 million.[311] Butler's dorms were demolished in 2007 and a new complex was built in 2009.[312] Butler and Mathey previously acted as only underclassmen colleges, but transitioned to four-year colleges in fall 2009.[313] Princeton completed and opened two new residential colleges—Yeh College and New College West—at the beginning of the academic year in September 2022.[314][f] The university plans to construct a new residential college named Hobson College where First College currently stands.[316]\n\n\n\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known as the Graduate College, located on a hill about half a mile from the main campus.[317][g] The location of the Graduate College was the result of a dispute between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean Andrew Fleming West. Wilson preferred a central location for the college; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus, and ultimately, he prevailed.[319] The Graduate College is composed of a large Collegiate Gothic section crowned by Cleveland Tower,[317] a memorial tower for former Princeton trustee Grover Cleveland.[320][321] The tower also has 67 carillon bells, making it one of the largest carillons in the world.[322] The attached New Graduate College provides a modern contrast in architectural style to the gothic Old Graduate College.[323] Graduate students also have the option of living in student apartments.[324]\n\n* ![A picture of First College](image)\n\nFirst College (founded 1957)\n* ![A picture of Forbes College](image)\n\nForbes College (founded 1984)\n* ![The exterior of Mathey College, specifically Blair Arch.](image)\n\nMathey College (founded 1983)\n* ![A picture of Rockefeller College](image)\n\nRockefeller College (founded 1982)\n* ![A picture showcasing the entrance to Butler College](image)\n\nButler College (founded 1983)\n* ![The exterior of Whitman College.](image)\n\nWhitman College (founded 2007)\n\n\n### Eating clubs and dining[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eating clubs at Princeton University\n\n![A picture of Ivy Club, the oldest eating club on campus](image)Founded in 1879, Ivy Club is the oldest and wealthiest eating club on campus\nEach residential college has a dining hall for students in the college, and they vary in their environment and food served.[325][326] Upperclassmen who no longer live in the college can choose from a variety of options: join an eating club and choose a shared meal plan; join a dining co-op, where groups of students eat, prepare, and cook food together; or organize their own dining.[325] The university offers kosher dining through the Center for Jewish Life and halal dining options for Muslim students in the dining halls.[325]\n\n\nSocial life takes place primarily on campus and is involved heavily with one's residential college or eating club.[303][151] Residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, ranging from Broadway show outings to regular barbecues.[305] Eating clubs, while not affiliated with the university, are co-ed organizations that serve as social centers, host events, and invite guest speakers.[327][69] Additionally, they serve as a place of community for upperclassmen.[327][151] Five of the clubs have first-serve memberships called \"sign-ins\" and six clubs use a selective process, in which students must \"bicker.\"[328] This requires prospective members to undergo an interviewing process.[329] Each eating club has a fee to join which ranges from around $9,000 to $10,000. As a result, Princeton increases financial aid for upperclassmen, and the eating clubs also offer financial assistance.[330][331] Cumulatively, there are ten clubs located on Prospect Avenue—Cannon, Cap and Gown, Charter, Cloister, Colonial, Cottage, Ivy, Quadrangle, Tiger, and Tower—and one located on Washington Road—Terrace.[332][328] 68% of upperclassmen are members of a club, with each one containing around 150 to 200 students[328]\n\n\n\n### Campus organizations[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton hosts around 500 recognized student organizations and several campus centers.[304]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Student Government (USG) serves as Princeton's student government.[333] The USG funds student organization events, sponsors campus events, and represents the undergraduate student body when convening with faculty and administration.[333]\n\n\n\n![A picture of Whig Hall](image)Whig Hall, where the American Whig-Cliosophic Society resides.\nFounded in about 1765, the American Whig-Cliosophic Society is the nation's oldest collegiate political, literary, and debate society,[334][151] and is the largest and oldest student organization on campus.[335] The Whig-Clio Society has several subsidiary organizations, each specialized to different areas of politics: the Princeton Debate Panel, International Relations Council, Princeton Mock Trial, and Princeton Model Congress.[336] The International Relations Council manages two Model United Nations conferences: the Princeton Diplomatic Invitational (PDI) for collegiate competition and the Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC) for high school competition.[337]\n\n\nThere are several publications on campus and a radio station. Founded in 1876, *The Daily Princetonian*, otherwise known as *The Prince*, is the second oldest college daily student newspaper in the United States.[338][339] Other publications include *The Nassau Literary Review*,[340] the *Princeton Tory*, a campus journal of conservative thought,[341] *The Princeton Diplomat*, the only student-run magazine on global affairs,[342] the *Princeton Political Review*, the only multi-partisan political publication on campus,[343] and the recently revived *Princeton Progressive*, the only left-leaning political publication on campus,[344][345] among others. Princeton's WPRB (103.3 FM) radio station is the oldest licensed college radio station in the nation.[151]\n\n\n\n![A picture of McCarter Theatre](image)The McCarter Theatre, where the Princeton Triangle Club premiers its Triangle Show.[346]\nPrinceton is home to a variety of performing arts and music groups. Many of the groups are represented by the Performing Arts Council.[347] Dating back to 1883, the Princeton Triangle Club is America's oldest touring musical-comedy theater group.[348][349] It performs its annual Triangle Show every fall at the 1,000 seat McCarter Theatre,[350][346] as well as original musical comedies, revues, and other shows throughout campus.[349] Princeton's oldest choir is the Glee Club, which began in 1874.[351] The comedic scramble Tiger Band was formed in 1919 and plays at halftime shows and other events.[352] Other groups include the Princeton University Orchestra, the flagship symphony orchestra group founded in 1896,[353] and the Princeton Symphony Orchestra,[354] both of which perform at Alexander Hall.[355][353]\n\n\nA cappella groups are a staple of campus life, with many holding concerts, informal shows, and arch sings.[351][356] Arch sings are where a cappella performances are held in one of Princeton's many gothic arches. The oldest a cappella ensemble is the Nassoons, which were formed in 1941. All-male groups include the Tigertones (1946) and Footnotes (1959); all-female groups include the Tigerlilies (1971), Tigressions (1981), Wildcats (1987); the oldest coed a cappella group in the Ivy League is the Princeton Katzenjammers (1973), which was followed by the Roaring 20 (1983) and Shere Khan (1994).[356]\n\n\nPrinceton features several campus centers for students that provide resources and information for students with certain identities. These include the Center for Jewish Life, the Davis International Center, the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality and Cultural Understanding, the Women's Center, and the LGBT Center. The Frist Campus Center and the Campus Club are additional facilities for the entire campus community that hold various activities and events.[304]\n\n\nPrinceton features 15 chaplaincies and multiple religious student groups. The following faiths are represented on campus: Baha'i, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Unitarian Universalism.[357]\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nPrinceton students partake in a wide variety of campus traditions, both past and present.[358] \n\n![A picture of FitzRandolph Gates](image)FitzRandolph Gates, which by tradition undergraduates do not exit until graduation.Current traditions Princeton students celebrate include the ceremonial bonfire, which takes place on the Cannon Green behind Nassau Hall. It is held only if Princeton beats both Harvard University and Yale University at football in the same season.[359] Another tradition is the use of traditional college cheers at events and reunions, like the \"Locomotive\", which dates back to before 1894.[360][361] Princeton students abide by the tradition of never exiting the campus through FitzRandolph Gates until one graduates. According to tradition, anyone who exits campus before their graduation will not graduate.[362][363] A more controversial tradition is Newman's Day, where some students attempt to drink 24 beers in the 24 hours of April 24. According to *The New York Times*, \"the day got its name from an apocryphal quote attributed to Paul Newman: '24 beers in a case, 24 hours in a day. Coincidence? I think not.'\"[364] Newman has spoken out against the tradition.[364] One of the biggest traditions celebrated annually are Reunions, which are massive annual gatherings of alumni.[365] At Reunions, a traditional parade of alumni and their families, known as the \"P-rade\", process through the campus.[366]\n\n\nPrinceton also has several traditions that have faded into the past. One of them was clapper theft, the act of climbing to the top of Nassau Hall to steal the bell clapper, which rings to signal the start of classes on the first day of the school year. For safety reasons, the clapper was permanently removed.[367] Another was the Nude Olympics, an annual nude and partially nude frolic in Holder Courtyard that used to take place during the first snow of the winter. Started in the early 1970s, the Nude Olympics went co-educational in 1979 and gained much notoriety with the American press. Due to issues of sexual harassment and safety reasons, the administration banned the Olympics in 2000 to the disappointment of students.[368][369]\n\n\n\n### Alma mater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nOld Nassau\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n\"Old Nassau\" has been Princeton University's school song since 1859, when it was written that year by freshman Harlan Page Peck. It was originally published in the *Nassau Literary Magazine*, where it won the magazine's prize for best college song. After an unsuccessful attempt at singing it to *Auld Lang Syne'*s melody, Karl Langlotz, a Princeton professor, wrote the music for it.[370] In 1987, the university changed the gendered lyrics of \"Old Nassau\" to reflect the school's co-educational student body.[371]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nTiger Transit is the bus system of the university, mostly open to the public and linking university campuses and areas around Princeton.[372] NJ Transit provides bus service on the 600, 606 and 609 lines and rail service on the Dinky, a small commuter train that provides service to the Princeton Junction Station.[373] Coach USA, through their subsidiary Suburban Transit, provides bus service to New York City and other destinations in New Jersey.[373]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[374] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Foreign national | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Hispanic | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[h] | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[i] | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Affluent[j] | 77%\n | 77 |\n\n\nPrinceton has made significant progress in expanding the diversity of its student body in recent years. The 2021 admitted freshman class was one of the most diverse in the school's history, with 68% of students identifying as students of color.[375] The university has worked to increase its enrollment of first-generation and low-income students in recent years.[376] The median family income of Princeton students is $186,100, with 72% of students coming from the top 20% highest-earning families.[377] In 2017, 22% of freshman qualified for federal Pell Grants, above the 16% average for the top 150 schools ranked by the *U.S. News & World Report*; nationwide, the average was 44%.[378] Based on data in a 2019 article in *The Daily Princetonian,* 10% of students hail from *Bloomberg's* 2018 list of \"100 richest places\", and that the top 20% of high schools send as many students to Princeton as the bottom 80%.[379]\n\n\nIn 1999, 10% of the student body was Jewish, a percentage lower than those at other Ivy League schools. 16% of the student body was Jewish in 1985; the number decreased by 40% from 1985 to 1999. This decline prompted *The Daily Princetonian* to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. *The New York Observer* wrote that Princeton was \"long dogged by a reputation for anti-Semitism\" and that this history as well as Princeton's elite status caused the university and its community to feel sensitivity towards the decrease of Jewish students. In the *Observer*, several theories are proposed for the drop, ranging from campus culture to changing admission policies to national patterns.[380] As of 2021, according to the Center for Jewish Life on campus, the university has approximately 700 Jewish students.[381]\n\n\nStarting in 1967, African American enrollment surged from 1.7% to 10% but has stagnated ever since.[382] Bruce M. Wright was admitted into the university in 1936 as the first African American, however, his admission was a mistake and when he got to campus he was asked to leave. Three years later Wright asked the dean for an explanation on his dismissal and the dean suggested to him that \"a member of your race might feel very much alone\" at Princeton University.[383] Princeton would not admit its first Black students until in 1945 when Princeton instituted the V-12 program on campus.[384] In 1947, John L. Howard, one of the four naval cadets admitted to the program, would become the first Black student to graduate with a bachelor's degree.[385][386]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of a tiger statue on Princeton's campus](image)Princeton's mascot is the tiger.\nPrinceton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides \"a variety of physical education and recreational programs\" for members of the Princeton community.[387] Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.[388] Princeton's colors are orange and black.[389] The school's athletes are known as the *Tigers*, and the mascot is a tiger.[389][390] The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.[391]\n\n\n\n### Varsity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Princeton Tigers\n\n![A picture showing a football match between Princeton University and Lehigh University in September 2007](image)Princeton vs. Lehigh football, September 2007\nPrinceton hosts 37 men's and women's varsity sports.[388] Princeton is an NCAA Division I school, with its athletic conference being the Ivy League.[389] Its rowing teams compete in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges, and its men's volleyball team competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.[392] Princeton's sailing team, though a club sport, competes at the varsity level in the MAISA conference of the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association.[393]\n\n\nPrinceton's football team competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I with the rest of the Ivy League.[394] Princeton played against Rutgers University in the first intercollegiate football game in the U.S. on November 6, 1869; Rutgers won the game.[395] From 1877 until at least 1903, Princeton played football using rugby rules.[396]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Princeton claims 28 national football championships, which would make it the most of any school, although the NCAA only recognizes 15 of the wins.[397][398] With its last win being in 2018, Princeton has won 12 Ivy League championships.[399] In 1951, Dick Kazmaier won Princeton its only Heisman Trophy, the last to come from the Ivy League.[400]\n\n\nThe men's basketball program is noted for its success under Pete Carril, the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 NCAA tournament appearances.[401] Carril introduced the Princeton offense, an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.[401][402] Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat UCLA, the defending national champion, in the opening round of the 1996 NCAA tournament.[401] On December 14, 2005, Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986–87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth University.[403]\n\n\nPrinceton women's soccer team advanced to the NCAA Division I Women's Soccer Championship semi-finals in 2004, becoming the first Ivy League team to do so in a 64 team setting.[404][405] The men's soccer team was coached from 1984 to 1995 by Princeton alumnus and future United States men's national team manager Bob Bradley, who lead the Tigers to win two Ivy League titles and make an appearance at the NCAA Final Four in 1993.[406] Princeton's men's lacrosse program undertook a period of notable success from 1992 to 2001, during which time it won six national championships.[407] In 2012, its field hockey team became the first in the Ivy League to win a national championship.[408]\n\n\nPrinceton has won at least one Ivy League title every year since 1957, and it became the first university in its conference to win over 500 Ivy League athletic championships.[408] From 1896 to 2018, 113 athletes from Princeton have competed in the Olympics, winning 19 gold medals, 24 silver medals, and 23 bronze medals.[409]\n\n\n\n### Club and intramural[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The annual Cane Spree depicted in 1877\nIn addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts 37 club sports teams, which are open to all Princeton students of any skill level.[410] Teams compete against other collegiate teams both in the Northeast and nationally.[410] The intramural sports program is also available on campus, which schedules competitions between residential colleges, eating clubs, independent groups, students, and faculty and staff.[304][411] Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.[412]\n\n\nIn the fall, freshman and sophomores participate in the intramural athletic competition called Cane Spree. Although the event centers on cane wrestling, freshman and sophomores compete in other sports and competitions. This commemorates a time in the 1870s when sophomores, angry with the freshmen who strutted around with fancy canes, stole all of the canes from the freshmen, hitting them with their own canes in the process.[413]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Princeton University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Princeton University as alumni or faculty.\n\n### Alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain category: Princeton University alumni\n\nU.S. Presidents James Madison and Woodrow Wilson and Vice Presidents George M. Dallas, John Breckinridge, and Aaron Burr graduated from Princeton,[414] as did Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United States.[415] Former Chief Justice of the United States Oliver Ellsworth was an alumnus, as are current U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justices Samuel Alito, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor.[416] Alumnus Jerome Powell was appointed as Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board in 2018.[417]\n\n\nPrinceton graduates played a major role in the American Revolution, including the first and last Colonels to die on the Patriot side Philip Johnston[418] and Nathaniel Scudder,[419] as well as the highest ranking civilian leader on the British side David Mathews.[420]\n\n\nNotable graduates of Princeton's School of Engineering and Applied Science include Apollo astronaut and commander of Apollo 12 Pete Conrad,[421] Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos,[422] former Chairman of Alphabet Inc.

Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date and the University of Pennsylvania once claimed 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth oldest, but in 1899 its trustees adopted a resolution which asserted 1740 as the founding date.[10][11] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, a Log College was operated by William and Gilbert Tennent, the Presbyterian ministers, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746 and it was once common to assert a formal connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. However, Princeton has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts \"do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[12] Columbia University was chartered and began collegiate classes in 1754. Columbia considers itself to be the fifth institution of higher learning in the United States, based upon its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[13]\n2. **^** The strike was part of the broader Student Strike of 1970.\n3. **^** 505 women applied to join the Princeton freshman class.[147]\n4. **^** The M.D./Ph.D. is granted in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and the Rutgers–New Brunswick Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\nAs of October 2023[update], 101 Nobel laureates,[10] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[11] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[12] 83 Marshall Scholars,[13] 41 astronauts,[14] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and various heads of states have been affiliated with MIT. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[15][16] MIT is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Foundation and vision[edit]\n\n\n> \n> ... a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.(Charter,1861)\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n![](image)Stereographic card showing an MIT mechanical drafting studio, 19th century (photo by E. L. Allen, left/right inverted)\n![](image)Original Rogers Building, Back Bay, Boston, c. 1901\nIn 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science,\" but the proposal failed.[19][20] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[21]\n\n\nRogers, a former student of the College of William and Mary and professor at the University of Virginia,[22] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[23][24] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[25] proposing that:\n\n\n\n\n> The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus\n![](image)The then-new Cambridge campus, completed in 1916. Harvard Bridge, named after John Harvard, the founder of Harvard University, is in the foreground, connecting Boston to Cambridge.\nTwo days after MIT was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.[29] The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions \"to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes\" and was a land-grant school.[30][31] In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.[32]\n\n\nMIT was informally called \"Boston Tech\".[32] The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.[27] Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker.[33] Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced,[34][35] new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.[33]\n\n\nThe curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science.[36] The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[37] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[38] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[38] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque in Building 6 honoring George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak, who was revealed as the anonymous \"Mr. Smith\" who helped maintain MIT's independence\nIn 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge *Bucentaur* built for the occasion,[39][40] to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a one mi-long (1.6 km) tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River.[41][42] The neoclassical \"New Technology\" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth[43] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious \"Mr. Smith\", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.[44]\n\n\n\n### Curricular reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.[45] The Compton reforms \"renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering\".[46] Unlike Ivy League schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding.[47] The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.[48]\n\n\nStill, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that \"the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school\", a \"partly unjustified\" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.[49][50] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs.[51][52] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980.[53]\n\n\n\n### Defense research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ROTC students celebrate Veterans Day at MIT in 2019.\nMIT's involvement in military science surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.[54] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory, established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area.[55] Other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight, bombsight, and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper's Instrumentation Laboratory;[56][57] the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind;[58] and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton.[59][60] By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush),[54] employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone[55] and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946.[46] Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo.[61]\n\n\n\n> \n> ... a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science, engineering, and the arts. We might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—MIT president James Rhyne Killian\n\nThese activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of \"any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute\" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the \"academic tranquility of the prewar years\", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.[63] The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.[64]\n\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research.[65][66] In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles.[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems.[68] MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests.[69][70] The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities.[65] Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to \"greater strength and unity\" after these times of turmoil.[71] However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests.[72] (Richard Leacock's film, *November Actions*, records some of these tumultuous events.[73])\n\n\nIn the 1980s, there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research.[74] More recently, MIT's research for the military has included work on robots, drones and 'battle suits'.[75]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology and shown here is the 1985 building, designed by I.M. Pei, with an extension (right of photo) designed by Fumihiko Maki opened in March 2010.\nMIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies,[76][77] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like *Spacewar!* and created much of modern hacker slang and culture.[78] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology;[79] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee;[80] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002;[81] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.[82]\n\n\nMIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs.[83][84] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new \"backlot\" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center.[85] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest.[86][87] In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption.[88]\n\n\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements,[89] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed.[90] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high,[91] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages.[92] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its \"MITx\" program, for a modest fee.[93] The \"edX\" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous \"Harvardx\" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.[94] In March 2009 the MIT faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.[95]\n\n\nMIT has its own police force. Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day.[96] One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada.[97][98][99] On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to \"an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life\". The announcement further stated that \"Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness\".[100][101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from California Institute of Technology, MIT, and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation. It was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.[105] Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and MIT physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017.[106] Weiss, who is also an MIT graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO.[107]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)The central and eastern sections of MIT's campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River. Left of center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court, with Kendall Square to the upper right.\n![](image)MIT's Building 10 and Great Dome overlooking Killian Court\nMIT's 166-acre (67.2 ha) campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin.[6] The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue, with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length – the smoot.[108][109]\n\n\nThe Kendall/MIT MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.[110][111] In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. The MIT Museum has moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus.[112]\n\n\nEach building at MIT has a number (possibly preceded by a *W*, *N*, *E*, or *NW*) designation, and most have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings.[113] Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.[114][115]\n\n\nMIT's on-campus nuclear reactor[116] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial,[117] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.[118] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\", and designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[119]\n\n\nMIT Nano, also known as Building 12, is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research. Its 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) cleanroom and research space, visible through expansive glass facades, is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation.[120] With a cost of US$400 million, it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus. The facility also provides state-of-the-art nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5×10~~^~~6 lb (2,300,000 kg) slab of concrete underground.[121]\n\n\nOther notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research, a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs, and previously Alcator C-Mod, which was the largest fusion device operated by any university.[122][123] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9.4×10~~^~~6 sq ft (870,000 m2) of campus.[124]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures.[125] MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects.[126] In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.[127]\n\n\nMIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes, plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt. As of 2017[update], it is the largest taxpayer in the city, contributing approximately 14% of the city's annual revenues.[128] Holdings include Technology Square, parts of Kendall Square, and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings.[129] The land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion.[130]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Stata Center houses CSAIL, LIDS, and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\nMIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first formal architecture program in the United States,[131] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.[132][133] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the \"Maclaurin buildings\" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a non-industrial – much less university – building in the US.[134] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s[134] and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.[a] The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus.[111]\n\n\nAlvar Aalto's Baker House (1947), Eero Saarinen's MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (1955), and I.M. Pei's Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture.[137][138][139] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus \"starchitecture\".[132][140] These buildings have not always been well received;[141][142] in 2010, *The Princeton Review* included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are \"tiny, unsightly, or both\".[143]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The Simmons Hall undergrad dormitory was completed in 2002.\nUndergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 11 undergraduate dormitories.[144] Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters.[145] Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the *Yale Daily News* staff's *The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010*, \"The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture.\"[146] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.[147]\n\n\nMIT has an active Greek and co-op housing system, including thirty-six fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).[148] As of 2015[update], 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities.[149] Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin.[150] After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002.[151] Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year.[152]\n\n\nIn 2013–2014, MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall, citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible. In 2017, MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm. That year, MIT administrators released data showing just 60% of Senior House residents had graduated in four years. Campus-wide, the four-year graduation rate is 84% (the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher).[153]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lobby 7 at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the main entrance to campus.\nMIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation.[154] The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms,[155] 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday,[156] 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary),[157] and 4 *ex officio* members (the president of the alumni association, the Governor of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court).[158][159] The board is chaired by Diane Greene SM ’78, co-founder and former CEO of VMware and former CEO of Google Cloud.[160] The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty.[111][161] MIT's endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo).[162] Valued at $16.4 billion in 2018, MIT's endowment was then the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities.[163]\n\n\nMIT has five schools (Science, Engineering, Architecture and Planning, Management, and Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) and one college (Schwarzman College of Computing), but no schools of law or medicine.[164][b][166] While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs,[167] the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President.[168] The current president is Sally Kornbluth, a cell biologist and former provost at Duke University. She became MIT's 18th president in January 2023.[169] She was preceded by L. Rafael Reif, who had served as provost under President Susan Hockfield, the first woman to hold the post.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[172] | 2021[173] | 2020[174] | 2019[175] | 2018[176] | 2017[177] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 33,767 | 33,240 | 20,075 | 21,312 | 21,706 | 20,247\n |\n| Admits\n | 1,337 | 1,365 | 1,457 | 1,427 | 1,464 | 1,452\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 1,136 | 1,177 | 1,070 | 1,102 | 1,114 | 1,097\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 4.0% | 4.1% | 7.3% | 6.7% | 6.7% | 7.2%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 85.0% | 86.2% | 73.4% | 77.2% | 76.1% | 75.5%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1520⁠–1570(78%†) | 1510⁠–1570(70%†) | 1510⁠–1570(77%†) | 1510⁠–1570(76%†) | 1500⁠–1570(75%†) | 1490⁠–1570(72%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 35–36(32%†) | 34–36(34%†) | 34–36(42%†) | 34–36(45%†) | 34–36(48%†) | 33–35(55%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nMIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs.[178] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[179] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in the month of January, and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May.[180]\n\n\nMIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone.[181] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1, while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24.[182] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as \"Course 6\". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; for instance, the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply \"8.01\" (pronounced *eight-oh-one*) at MIT.[183][c]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in MIT (2017–2023)\n| Academic Year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total Enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[177] | 4,547 | 6,919 | 11,466\n |\n| 2018–2019[176] | 4,602 | 6,972 | 11,574\n |\n| 2019–2020[175] | 4,530 | 6,990 | 11,520\n |\n| 2020–2021[174] | 4,361 | 6,893 | 11,254\n |\n| 2021–2022[173] | 4,638 | 7,296 | 11,934\n |\n| 2022–2023[172] | 4,657 | 7,201 | 11,858\n |\n\n\nThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences. In 2010, it was dubbed \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*,[186] admitting few transfer students[178] and 4.1% of its applicants in the 2020–2021 admissions cycle.[187] It is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[188] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.[189] In the 2017–2018 academic year, 1,045 Bachelor of Science degrees (abbreviated \"SB\") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.[*needs update*][190][191] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%).[*needs update*] The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6–2), Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6–3), Mechanical Engineering (Course 2), Physics (Course 8), and Mathematics (Course 18).[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).[192] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be \"communication-intensive\",[193] including \"substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation\".[194] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test;[195] non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes.[192]\n\n\nMost classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets (\"p-sets\"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to \"drinking from a fire hose\",[196][197][198] the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities.[186] The \"pass/no-record\" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded.[199] (Grading had previously been \"pass/no record\" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year.[200]) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as Experimental Study Group, Concourse, or Terrascope.[199]\n\n\nIn 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects (\"UROPs\") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.[201] A substantial majority of undergraduates participate.[202][203] Students often become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.[204][205]\n\n\nIn 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published *The Hidden Curriculum,* arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled \"course bibles\"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.[206][207]\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nMIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees, including the Master of Business Administration (MBA).[178] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as MS at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (DSc) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School) and a joint program in oceanography with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[208][209][210][211]\n\n\nAdmission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).[212]\n\n\n\n### MIT Bootcamps[edit]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamps are intense week-long innovation and leadership programs that challenge participants to develop a venture in a week.[213] Each Bootcamp centers around a particular topic, specific to an industry, leadership skill set, or emerging technology. Cohorts are organized into small teams who work on an entrepreneurial project together, in addition to individual learning and team coaching. The program includes a series of online seminars with MIT faculty, practitioners, and industry experts, innovation workshops with bootcamp instructors focused on putting the theory participants have learned into practice, coaching sessions, and informal office hours for learners to exchange ideas freely. Bootcampers are tasked with weekly \"deliverables\", which are key elements of a business plan, to help guide the group through the decision-making process involved in building an enterprise. The experience culminates in a final pitch session, judged by a panel of experts.[214]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamp instructors include Eric von Hippel, Sanjay Sarma, Erdin Beshimov, and Bill Aulet.[215] MIT Bootcamps were founded by Erdin Beshimov.[216][214][217]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[218] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[219] | 2

places among the top five in many overall rankings of universities (see table right) and rankings based on students' revealed preferences.[226][227][228] For several years, *U.S. News & World Report*, the QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report.[229] In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.[230]\n\n\nTimes Higher Education has recognized MIT as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford.[231] In 2019, it was ranked #3 among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[232] In 2017, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings also rated MIT the #2 university for arts and humanities.[233][234] MIT was ranked #7 in 2015 and #6 in 2017 of the Nature Index Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[235][236][237] Georgetown University researchers ranked MIT #3 in the US for 20-year return on investment.[238]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Collaborations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eero Saarinen's Kresge Auditorium (1955) is a classic example of post-war architecture.\nThe university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government.[239][240] In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm.[241][242] In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program.[243] Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.[244][245] On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940.[d] MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.[247][248]\n\n\nThe US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT, the eight Ivy League colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual \"Overlap Meetings\", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships.[249][250] While the Ivy League institutions settled,[251] MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.[252][253] MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.[254][255]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walker Memorial is a monument to MIT's fourth president, Francis Amasa Walker.\n![](image)MIT main campus seen from Vassar Street, as The Great Dome is visible in the distance and the Stata Center is at right\nMIT's proximity[e] to Harvard University (\"the other school up the river\") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute.[256] In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees.[256] A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge.[256] MIT also has a long-term partnership with Imperial College London, for both student exchanges and research collaboration.[257][258] More modest cross-registration programs have been established with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[256]\n\n\nMIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[211] Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute), Singapore-MIT Alliance, MIT-Politecnico di Milano,[256][259] MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program.[256][260]\n\n\nThe mass-market magazine *Technology Review* is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine.[261][262] The MIT Press is a major university press, publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually, emphasizing science and technology as well as arts, architecture, new media, current events, and social issues.[263]\n\n\nMIT Microphotonics Center and PhotonDelta founded the global roadmap for integrated photonics: Integrated Photonics Systems Roadmap – International (IPSR-I). The first edition has been published in 2020. The roadmap is an amalgamation of two previously independent roadmaps: the IPSR roadmap of MIT Microphotonics Center and AIM Photonics in the United States, and the WTMF (World Technology Mapping Forum) of PhotonDelta in Europe.[264]\n\n\n\n### Libraries, collections, and museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology § Artwork\n\nThe MIT library system consists of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries.[265] Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music,[266] the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art,[267] and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions.[268] MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.[269][270]\n\n\nThe MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects, preserves, and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT. The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public, including the annual Cambridge Science Festival, the first celebration of this kind in the United States. Since 2005, its official mission has been, \"to engage the wider community with MIT's science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century\".[271]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nMIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\";[48][178] research expenditures totaled $952 million in 2017.[272] The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million.[273] MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty.[274] In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties.[275] Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.[276]\n\n\nIn electronics, magnetic-core memory, radar, single-electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.[277][278] Harold Eugene Edgerton was a pioneer in high-speed photography and sonar.[279][280] Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory.[281] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.[278][282] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.[283][284]\n\n\nCurrent and previous physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes,[285] four ICTP Dirac Medals,[286] and three Wolf Prizes predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory.[287] Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods.[285] MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology.[285] Professor Eric Lander was one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project.[288][289] Positronium atoms,[290] synthetic penicillin,[291] synthetic self-replicating molecules,[292] and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT.[293] Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper \"What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain\".[294] Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models.[295]\n\n\nIn the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, as of October 2019 MIT economists have been awarded seven Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals.[285][296] Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle authored seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology.[297][298] The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research,[299][300] has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.[301]\n\n\nSpanning many of the above fields, MacArthur Fellowships (the so-called \"Genius Grants\") have been awarded to 50 people associated with MIT.[302] Five Pulitzer Prize–winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT.[303] Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[304]\n\n\nAllegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.[305][306] Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.[307][308] Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.[309][310]\n\n\nIn 2019, Clarivate Analytics named 54 members of MIT's faculty to its list of \"Highly Cited Researchers\". That number places MIT eighth among the world's universities.[311]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Oncogene – Robert Weinberg discovered genetic basis of human cancer.[312]\n* Reverse transcription – David Baltimore independently isolated, in 1970 at MIT, two RNA tumor viruses: R-MLV and again RSV.[313]\n* Thermal death time – Samuel Cate Prescott and William Lyman Underwood from 1895 to 1898.

The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale, Utah State University, the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley.[333]\n* Perdix micro-drone – autonomous drone that uses artificial intelligence to swarm with many other Perdix drones.[334]\n* Project MAC – groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. DARPA funded project.[335]\n* Radar – developed at MIT's Radiation Laboratory during World War II.[336]\n* SKETCHPAD – invented by Ivan Sutherland at MIT (presented in his PhD thesis). It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction (HCI).[337] Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general.[338]\n* VisiCalc – first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp. MIT alumni Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston rented time sharing at night on an MIT mainframe computer (that cost $1/hr for use).[339]\n* World Wide Web Consortium – founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web[340]\n* X Window System – pioneering architecture-independent system for graphical user interfaces that has been widely used for Unix and Linux systems.[341]\n\n\n### Companies and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni\nMIT alumni and faculty have founded numerous companies, some of which are shown below:[342][343]\n\n\n* Analog Devices, 1965, co-founders Ray Stata, (SB, SM) and Matthew Lorber (SB)\n* BlackRock, 1988, co-founder Bennett Golub, (SB, SM, PhD)\n* Bose Corporation, 1964, founder Amar Bose (SB, PhD)\n* Buzzfeed, 2006, co-founder Jonah Peretti (SM)\n* Dropbox, 2007, founders Drew Houston (SB) and Arash Ferdowsi (drop-out)\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939, co-founder William R.

However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993.[349]\n\n\nMany upperclass students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring known as the \"Brass Rat\".[350][351] Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the \"Standard Technology Ring\".[352] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver.[350] The initialism IHTFP, representing the informal school motto \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" and jocularly euphemized as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute Has The Finest Professors\", \"Institute of Hacks, TomFoolery and Pranks\", \"It's Hard to Fondle Penguins\", and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture.[353]\n\n\n\n### Caltech Rivalry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Caltech–MIT rivalry\n\nMIT also shares a well-known rivalry with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), stemming from both institutions' reputations as two of the highest ranked and most highly recognized science and engineering schools in the world.[354] The rivalry is an unusual college rivalry given its focus on academics and pranks instead of sports, and due to the geographic distance between the two (their campuses are separated by about 2580 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States). In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. The cannon was relocated to Cambridge, where it was displayed in front of the Green Building during the 2006 Campus Preview Weekend.[358][359] In September 2010, MIT students unsuccessfully tried to place a life-sized model of the TARDIS time machine from the *Doctor Who* (1963–present) television series on top of Baxter Hall at Caltech. A few months later, Caltech students collaborated to help MIT students place the TARDIS on top of their originally planned destination.[360] The rivalry has continued, most recently in 2014, when a group of Caltech students gave out mugs sporting the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turned orange and read, \"Caltech, The Hotter Institute of Technology.\"[361]\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Traditions and student activities at MIT\n\nSee also: Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The start of the MIT Mystery Hunt in 2007\nMIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups,[362] including a campus radio station, *The Tech* student newspaper, an annual entrepreneurship competition, a crime club, and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee. Less traditional activities include the \"world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction\" in English, a model railroad club, and a vibrant folk dance scene. Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum, Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center.[363]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities provide a base of activities in addition to housing. Approximately 1,000 undergrads, 48% of men and 30% of women, participate in one of several dozen Greek Life men's, women's and co-ed chapters on the campus.[364]\n\n\nThe Independent Activities Period is a four-week-long \"term\" offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are Autonomous Robot Design (course 6.270), Robocraft Programming (6.370), and MasLab competitions,[365] the annual \"mystery hunt\",[366] and Charm School.[367][368] More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad.[369][370]\n\n\nMany MIT students also engage in \"hacking\", which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as elaborate practical jokes.[371][372] Examples of high-profile hacks have included the abduction of Caltech's cannon,[373] reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome,[374] and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chief's Mjölnir Helmet.[375]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MIT Engineers\n\n![](image)The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center houses a two-story fitness center as well as swimming and diving pools.\nMIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs.[376][377] MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, NCAA's Division I Patriot League for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). The intercollegiate sports teams, called the MIT Engineers won 22 Team National Championships, 42 Individual National Championships. MIT is the all-time Division III leader in producing Academic All-Americas (302) and rank second across all NCAA Divisions only behind the University of Nebraska.[378] MIT Athletes won 13 Elite 90 awards and ranks first among NCAA Division III programs, and third among all divisions.[379] In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling.[380][381]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[382] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian | 32%\n | 32 |\n| White | 26%\n | 26 |\n| Hispanic | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[f] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[g] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[h] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nMIT enrolled 4,602 undergraduates and 6,972 graduate students in 2018–2019.[383] Undergraduate and graduate students came from all 50 US states as well as from 115 foreign countries.[384]\n\n\nMIT received 33,240 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2025: it admitted 1,365 (4.1 percent).[385] In 2019, 29,114 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree programs across all departments; 3,670 were admitted (12.6 percent) and 2,312 enrolled (63 percent).[386]\n\n\nUndergraduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was $53,790 for nine months. 59% of students were awarded a need-based MIT scholarship. Graduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was also $53,790 for nine months, and summer tuition was $17,800. Financial support for graduate students are provided in large part by individual departments. They include fellowships, traineeships, teaching and research assistantships, and loans.[387] The annual increase in expenses had led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek \"tuition riots\".[388]\n\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Between 1964 and 2009 a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT won Nobel Prizes (thirteen of them in the latter 25 years).[396] As of October 2020, 37 MIT faculty members, past or present, have won Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.[397]\n\n\nAs of October 2013[update], current faculty and teaching staff included 67 Guggenheim Fellows, 6 Fulbright Scholars, and 22 MacArthur Fellows.[4] Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures. Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, served as MIT's president from 2004 to 2012. She was the first woman to hold the post.[171]\n\n\nMIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty-member Charles W. Eliot became president of Harvard University in 1869, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence both on American higher education and on secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.\n\n\nAs of 2014[update] former provost Robert A. Brown served as president of Boston University; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University; and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST. Former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004–2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008–2013); former professor David Baltimore was president of Caltech (1997–2006); and MIT alumnus and former assistant professor Hans Mark served as chancellor of the University of Texas system (1984–1992).\n\n\nIn addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor Marcia McNutt is president of the National Academy of Sciences,[398] urban studies professor Xavier de Souza Briggs served as the associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,[399] and biology professor Eric Lander was a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[400] In 2013, faculty member Ernest Moniz was nominated by President Obama and later confirmed as United States Secretary of Energy.[401][402] Former professor Hans Mark served as Secretary of the Air Force from 1979 to 1981. Alumna and Institute Professor Sheila Widnall served as Secretary of the Air Force between 1993 and 1997, making her the first female Secretary of the Air Force and first woman to lead an entire branch of the US military in the Department of Defense. A 1999 report, met by promises of change by President Charles Vest, found that senior female faculty in the School of Science were often marginalized, and in return for equal professional accomplishments received reduced \"salary, space, awards, resources, and response to outside offers\".[403]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], MIT was the second-largest employer in the city of Cambridge.[128] Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked No. 7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of March 2013[update].[404] Surveys cited a \"smart\", \"creative\", \"friendly\" environment, noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a \"strong work ethic\" but complaining about \"low pay\" compared to an industry position.[405]\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

As of October 2020[update], 41 MIT alumni have won Nobel Prizes, 48 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars,[406] 61 have been selected as Marshall Scholars,[407] and 3 have been selected as Mitchell Scholars.[408]\n\n\nAlumni in United States politics and public service include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, former MA-1 Representative John Olver, former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark, Representative Thomas Massie, Senator Alex Padilla, former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers,[409] and former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Christina Romer. MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi,[410] former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband, former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, former Minister of Education and Culture of The Republic of Indonesia Yahya Muhaimin, former Jordanian Minister of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research and former Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Khaled Toukan. Alumni in sports have included Olympic fencing champion Johan Harmenberg.\nMIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Apotex, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, \"a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year\". If the companies founded by MIT alumni were a country, they would have the 11th-highest GDP of any country in the world.[411][412][413]\n\n\nMIT alumni have led prominent institutions of higher education, including the University of California system, Harvard University, the New York Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Carnegie Mellon University, Tufts University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Tel Aviv University, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Purdue University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, KAIST, and Quaid-e-Azam University. Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, was founded and led by MIT alumnus Lawrence Berk for more than three decades.\n\n\nMore than one third of the United States' crewed spaceflights have included MIT-educated astronauts, a contribution exceeding that of any university excluding the United States service academies.[414] Of the 12 people who have set foot on the Moon as of 2019[update], four graduated from MIT (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin). Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen led the Chinese nuclear-weapons program and became instrumental in Chinese rocket-program.[415]\n\n\nNoted alumni in non-scientific fields include author Hugh Lofting,[416] sculptor Daniel Chester French, guitarist Tom Scholz of the band Boston, the British *BBC* and *ITN* correspondent and political advisor David Walter, *The New York Times* columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, *The Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, United States Supreme Court building architect Cass Gilbert,[417]\nPritzker Prize-winning architects I.M.

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\nAs of October 2023[update], 101 Nobel laureates,[10] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[11] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[12] 83 Marshall Scholars,[13] 41 astronauts,[14] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and various heads of states have been affiliated with MIT. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[15][16] MIT is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Foundation and vision[edit]\n\n\n> \n> ... a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.(Charter,1861)\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n![](image)Stereographic card showing an MIT mechanical drafting studio, 19th century (photo by E. L. Allen, left/right inverted)\n![](image)Original Rogers Building, Back Bay, Boston, c. 1901\nIn 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science,\" but the proposal failed.[19][20] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[21]\n\n\nRogers, a former student of the College of William and Mary and professor at the University of Virginia,[22] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[23][24] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[25] proposing that:\n\n\n\n\n> The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus\n![](image)The then-new Cambridge campus, completed in 1916. Harvard Bridge, named after John Harvard, the founder of Harvard University, is in the foreground, connecting Boston to Cambridge.\nTwo days after MIT was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.[29] The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions \"to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes\" and was a land-grant school.[30][31] In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.[32]\n\n\nMIT was informally called \"Boston Tech\".[32] The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.[27] Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker.[33] Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced,[34][35] new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.[33]\n\n\nThe curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science.[36] The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[37] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[38] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[38] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque in Building 6 honoring George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak, who was revealed as the anonymous \"Mr. Smith\" who helped maintain MIT's independence\nIn 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge *Bucentaur* built for the occasion,[39][40] to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a one mi-long (1.6 km) tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River.[41][42] The neoclassical \"New Technology\" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth[43] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious \"Mr. Smith\", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.[44]\n\n\n\n### Curricular reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.[45] The Compton reforms \"renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering\".[46] Unlike Ivy League schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding.[47] The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.[48]\n\n\nStill, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that \"the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school\", a \"partly unjustified\" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.[49][50] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs.[51][52] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980.[53]\n\n\n\n### Defense research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ROTC students celebrate Veterans Day at MIT in 2019.\nMIT's involvement in military science surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.[54] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory, established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area.[55] Other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight, bombsight, and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper's Instrumentation Laboratory;[56][57] the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind;[58] and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton.[59][60] By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush),[54] employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone[55] and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946.[46] Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo.[61]\n\n\n\n> \n> ... a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science, engineering, and the arts. We might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—MIT president James Rhyne Killian\n\nThese activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of \"any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute\" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the \"academic tranquility of the prewar years\", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.[63] The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.[64]\n\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research.[65][66] In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles.[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems.[68] MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests.[69][70] The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities.[65] Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to \"greater strength and unity\" after these times of turmoil.[71] However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests.[72] (Richard Leacock's film, *November Actions*, records some of these tumultuous events.[73])\n\n\nIn the 1980s, there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research.[74] More recently, MIT's research for the military has included work on robots, drones and 'battle suits'.[75]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology and shown here is the 1985 building, designed by I.M. Pei, with an extension (right of photo) designed by Fumihiko Maki opened in March 2010.\nMIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies,[76][77] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like *Spacewar!* and created much of modern hacker slang and culture.[78] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology;[79] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee;[80] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002;[81] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.[82]\n\n\nMIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs.[83][84] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new \"backlot\" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center.[85] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest.[86][87] In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption.[88]\n\n\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements,[89] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed.[90] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high,[91] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages.[92] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its \"MITx\" program, for a modest fee.[93] The \"edX\" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous \"Harvardx\" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.[94] In March 2009 the MIT faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.[95]\n\n\nMIT has its own police force. Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day.[96] One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada.[97][98][99] On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to \"an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life\". The announcement further stated that \"Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness\".[100][101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from California Institute of Technology, MIT, and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation. It was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.[105] Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and MIT physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017.[106] Weiss, who is also an MIT graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO.[107]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)The central and eastern sections of MIT's campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River. Left of center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court, with Kendall Square to the upper right.\n![](image)MIT's Building 10 and Great Dome overlooking Killian Court\nMIT's 166-acre (67.2 ha) campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin.[6] The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue, with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length – the smoot.[108][109]\n\n\nThe Kendall/MIT MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.[110][111] In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. The MIT Museum has moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus.[112]\n\n\nEach building at MIT has a number (possibly preceded by a *W*, *N*, *E*, or *NW*) designation, and most have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings.[113] Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.[114][115]\n\n\nMIT's on-campus nuclear reactor[116] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial,[117] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.[118] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\", and designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[119]\n\n\nMIT Nano, also known as Building 12, is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research. Its 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) cleanroom and research space, visible through expansive glass facades, is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation.[120] With a cost of US$400 million, it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus. The facility also provides state-of-the-art nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5×10~~^~~6 lb (2,300,000 kg) slab of concrete underground.[121]\n\n\nOther notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research, a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs, and previously Alcator C-Mod, which was the largest fusion device operated by any university.[122][123] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9.4×10~~^~~6 sq ft (870,000 m2) of campus.[124]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures.[125] MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects.[126] In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.[127]\n\n\nMIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes, plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt. As of 2017[update], it is the largest taxpayer in the city, contributing approximately 14% of the city's annual revenues.[128] Holdings include Technology Square, parts of Kendall Square, and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings.[129] The land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion.[130]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Stata Center houses CSAIL, LIDS, and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\nMIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first formal architecture program in the United States,[131] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.[132][133] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the \"Maclaurin buildings\" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a non-industrial – much less university – building in the US.[134] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s[134] and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.[a] The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus.[111]\n\n\nAlvar Aalto's Baker House (1947), Eero Saarinen's MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (1955), and I.M. Pei's Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture.[137][138][139] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus \"starchitecture\".[132][140] These buildings have not always been well received;[141][142] in 2010, *The Princeton Review* included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are \"tiny, unsightly, or both\".[143]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The Simmons Hall undergrad dormitory was completed in 2002.\nUndergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 11 undergraduate dormitories.[144] Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters.[145] Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the *Yale Daily News* staff's *The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010*, \"The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture.\"[146] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.[147]\n\n\nMIT has an active Greek and co-op housing system, including thirty-six fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).[148] As of 2015[update], 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities.[149] Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin.[150] After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002.[151] Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year.[152]\n\n\nIn 2013–2014, MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall, citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible. In 2017, MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm. That year, MIT administrators released data showing just 60% of Senior House residents had graduated in four years. Campus-wide, the four-year graduation rate is 84% (the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher).[153]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lobby 7 at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the main entrance to campus.\nMIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation.[154] The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms,[155] 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday,[156] 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary),[157] and 4 *ex officio* members (the president of the alumni association, the Governor of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court).[158][159] The board is chaired by Diane Greene SM ’78, co-founder and former CEO of VMware and former CEO of Google Cloud.[160] The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty.[111][161] MIT's endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo).[162] Valued at $16.4 billion in 2018, MIT's endowment was then the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities.[163]\n\n\nMIT has five schools (Science, Engineering, Architecture and Planning, Management, and Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) and one college (Schwarzman College of Computing), but no schools of law or medicine.[164][b][166] While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs,[167] the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President.[168] The current president is Sally Kornbluth, a cell biologist and former provost at Duke University. She became MIT's 18th president in January 2023.[169] She was preceded by L. Rafael Reif, who had served as provost under President Susan Hockfield, the first woman to hold the post.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[172] | 2021[173] | 2020[174] | 2019[175] | 2018[176] | 2017[177] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 33,767 | 33,240 | 20,075 | 21,312 | 21,706 | 20,247\n |\n| Admits\n | 1,337 | 1,365 | 1,457 | 1,427 | 1,464 | 1,452\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 1,136 | 1,177 | 1,070 | 1,102 | 1,114 | 1,097\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 4.0% | 4.1% | 7.3% | 6.7% | 6.7% | 7.2%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 85.0% | 86.2% | 73.4% | 77.2% | 76.1% | 75.5%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1520⁠–1570(78%†) | 1510⁠–1570(70%†) | 1510⁠–1570(77%†) | 1510⁠–1570(76%†) | 1500⁠–1570(75%†) | 1490⁠–1570(72%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 35–36(32%†) | 34–36(34%†) | 34–36(42%†) | 34–36(45%†) | 34–36(48%†) | 33–35(55%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nMIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs.[178] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[179] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in the month of January, and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May.[180]\n\n\nMIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone.[181] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1, while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24.[182] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as \"Course 6\". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; for instance, the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply \"8.01\" (pronounced *eight-oh-one*) at MIT.[183][c]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in MIT (2017–2023)\n| Academic Year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total Enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[177] | 4,547 | 6,919 | 11,466\n |\n| 2018–2019[176] | 4,602 | 6,972 | 11,574\n |\n| 2019–2020[175] | 4,530 | 6,990 | 11,520\n |\n| 2020–2021[174] | 4,361 | 6,893 | 11,254\n |\n| 2021–2022[173] | 4,638 | 7,296 | 11,934\n |\n| 2022–2023[172] | 4,657 | 7,201 | 11,858\n |\n\n\nThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences. In 2010, it was dubbed \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*,[186] admitting few transfer students[178] and 4.1% of its applicants in the 2020–2021 admissions cycle.[187] It is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[188] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.[189] In the 2017–2018 academic year, 1,045 Bachelor of Science degrees (abbreviated \"SB\") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.[*needs update*][190][191] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%).[*needs update*] The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6–2), Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6–3), Mechanical Engineering (Course 2), Physics (Course 8), and Mathematics (Course 18).[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).[192] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be \"communication-intensive\",[193] including \"substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation\".[194] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test;[195] non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes.[192]\n\n\nMost classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets (\"p-sets\"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to \"drinking from a fire hose\",[196][197][198] the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities.[186] The \"pass/no-record\" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded.[199] (Grading had previously been \"pass/no record\" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year.[200]) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as Experimental Study Group, Concourse, or Terrascope.[199]\n\n\nIn 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects (\"UROPs\") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.[201] A substantial majority of undergraduates participate.[202][203] Students often become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.[204][205]\n\n\nIn 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published *The Hidden Curriculum,* arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled \"course bibles\"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.[206][207]\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nMIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees, including the Master of Business Administration (MBA).[178] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as MS at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (DSc) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School) and a joint program in oceanography with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[208][209][210][211]\n\n\nAdmission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).[212]\n\n\n\n### MIT Bootcamps[edit]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamps are intense week-long innovation and leadership programs that challenge participants to develop a venture in a week.[213] Each Bootcamp centers around a particular topic, specific to an industry, leadership skill set, or emerging technology. Cohorts are organized into small teams who work on an entrepreneurial project together, in addition to individual learning and team coaching. The program includes a series of online seminars with MIT faculty, practitioners, and industry experts, innovation workshops with bootcamp instructors focused on putting the theory participants have learned into practice, coaching sessions, and informal office hours for learners to exchange ideas freely. Bootcampers are tasked with weekly \"deliverables\", which are key elements of a business plan, to help guide the group through the decision-making process involved in building an enterprise. The experience culminates in a final pitch session, judged by a panel of experts.[214]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamp instructors include Eric von Hippel, Sanjay Sarma, Erdin Beshimov, and Bill Aulet.[215] MIT Bootcamps were founded by Erdin Beshimov.[216][214][217]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[218] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[219] | 2

places among the top five in many overall rankings of universities (see table right) and rankings based on students' revealed preferences.[226][227][228] For several years, *U.S. News & World Report*, the QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report.[229] In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.[230]\n\n\nTimes Higher Education has recognized MIT as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford.[231] In 2019, it was ranked #3 among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[232] In 2017, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings also rated MIT the #2 university for arts and humanities.[233][234] MIT was ranked #7 in 2015 and #6 in 2017 of the Nature Index Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[235][236][237] Georgetown University researchers ranked MIT #3 in the US for 20-year return on investment.[238]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Collaborations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eero Saarinen's Kresge Auditorium (1955) is a classic example of post-war architecture.\nThe university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government.[239][240] In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm.[241][242] In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program.[243] Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.[244][245] On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940.[d] MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.[247][248]\n\n\nThe US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT, the eight Ivy League colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual \"Overlap Meetings\", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships.[249][250] While the Ivy League institutions settled,[251] MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.[252][253] MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.[254][255]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walker Memorial is a monument to MIT's fourth president, Francis Amasa Walker.\n![](image)MIT main campus seen from Vassar Street, as The Great Dome is visible in the distance and the Stata Center is at right\nMIT's proximity[e] to Harvard University (\"the other school up the river\") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute.[256] In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees.[256] A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge.[256] MIT also has a long-term partnership with Imperial College London, for both student exchanges and research collaboration.[257][258] More modest cross-registration programs have been established with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[256]\n\n\nMIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[211] Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute), Singapore-MIT Alliance, MIT-Politecnico di Milano,[256][259] MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program.[256][260]\n\n\nThe mass-market magazine *Technology Review* is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine.[261][262] The MIT Press is a major university press, publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually, emphasizing science and technology as well as arts, architecture, new media, current events, and social issues.[263]\n\n\nMIT Microphotonics Center and PhotonDelta founded the global roadmap for integrated photonics: Integrated Photonics Systems Roadmap – International (IPSR-I). The first edition has been published in 2020. The roadmap is an amalgamation of two previously independent roadmaps: the IPSR roadmap of MIT Microphotonics Center and AIM Photonics in the United States, and the WTMF (World Technology Mapping Forum) of PhotonDelta in Europe.[264]\n\n\n\n### Libraries, collections, and museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology § Artwork\n\nThe MIT library system consists of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries.[265] Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music,[266] the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art,[267] and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions.[268] MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.[269][270]\n\n\nThe MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects, preserves, and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT. The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public, including the annual Cambridge Science Festival, the first celebration of this kind in the United States. Since 2005, its official mission has been, \"to engage the wider community with MIT's science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century\".[271]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nMIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\";[48][178] research expenditures totaled $952 million in 2017.[272] The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million.[273] MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty.[274] In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties.[275] Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.[276]\n\n\nIn electronics, magnetic-core memory, radar, single-electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.[277][278] Harold Eugene Edgerton was a pioneer in high-speed photography and sonar.[279][280] Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory.[281] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.[278][282] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.[283][284]\n\n\nCurrent and previous physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes,[285] four ICTP Dirac Medals,[286] and three Wolf Prizes predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory.[287] Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods.[285] MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology.[285] Professor Eric Lander was one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project.[288][289] Positronium atoms,[290] synthetic penicillin,[291] synthetic self-replicating molecules,[292] and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT.[293] Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper \"What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain\".[294] Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models.[295]\n\n\nIn the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, as of October 2019 MIT economists have been awarded seven Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals.[285][296] Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle authored seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology.[297][298] The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research,[299][300] has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.[301]\n\n\nSpanning many of the above fields, MacArthur Fellowships (the so-called \"Genius Grants\") have been awarded to 50 people associated with MIT.[302] Five Pulitzer Prize–winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT.[303] Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[304]\n\n\nAllegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.[305][306] Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.[307][308] Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.[309][310]\n\n\nIn 2019, Clarivate Analytics named 54 members of MIT's faculty to its list of \"Highly Cited Researchers\". That number places MIT eighth among the world's universities.[311]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Oncogene – Robert Weinberg discovered genetic basis of human cancer.[312]\n* Reverse transcription – David Baltimore independently isolated, in 1970 at MIT, two RNA tumor viruses: R-MLV and again RSV.[313]\n* Thermal death time – Samuel Cate Prescott and William Lyman Underwood from 1895 to 1898. Done for canning of food. Applications later found useful in medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.[314]\n* Electroweak interaction – Steven Weinberg proposed the electroweak unification theory, which gave rise to the modern formulation of the Standard Model, in 1967 at MIT.[315]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Akamai Technologies – Daniel Lewin and Tom Leighton developed a faster content delivery network, now one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms, responsible for serving between 15 and 30 percent of all web traffic.[316]\n* Cryptography – MIT researchers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman developed one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems, the RSA cryptosystem, and started a company, RSA Security.[317]\n* Digital circuits – Claude Shannon, while a master's degree student at MIT, developed the digital circuit design theory which paved the way for modern computers.[318]\n* Electronic ink – developed by Joseph Jacobson at MIT Media Lab.[319]\n* Emacs (text editor) – development began during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab.[320]\n* Flight recorder (black box) – Charles Stark Draper developed the black box at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory. That lab later made the Apollo Moon landings possible through the Apollo Guidance Computer it designed for NASA.[321]\n* GNU Project – Richard Stallman formally founded the free software movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project at MIT.[322][323][324]\n* Julia (programming language) – Development was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, all at MIT at that time, and continued with the contribution of a dedicated MIT Julia Lab[325]\n* Lisp (programming language) – John McCarthy invented Lisp at MIT in 1958.[326]\n* Lithium-ion battery efficiencies – Yet-Ming Chiang and his group at MIT showed a substantial improvement in the performance of lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it[327] with aluminium, niobium and zirconium.[328][329]\n* Macsyma, one of the oldest general-purpose computer algebra systems; the GPL-licensed version Maxima remains in wide use.[330]\n* MIT OpenCourseWare – the OpenCourseWare movement started in 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its *timms* initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server).[331] The OCW movement only took off, however, with the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare and the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University[332] in October 2002. The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale, Utah State University, the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley.[333]\n* Perdix micro-drone – autonomous drone that uses artificial intelligence to swarm with many other Perdix drones.[334]\n* Project MAC – groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. DARPA funded project.[335]\n* Radar – developed at MIT's Radiation Laboratory during World War II.[336]\n* SKETCHPAD – invented by Ivan Sutherland at MIT (presented in his PhD thesis). It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction (HCI).[337] Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general.[338]\n* VisiCalc – first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp. MIT alumni Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston rented time sharing at night on an MIT mainframe computer (that cost $1/hr for use).[339]\n* World Wide Web Consortium – founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web[340]\n* X Window System – pioneering architecture-independent system for graphical user interfaces that has been widely used for Unix and Linux systems.[341]\n\n\n### Companies and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni\nMIT alumni and faculty have founded numerous companies, some of which are shown below:[342][343]\n\n\n* Analog Devices, 1965, co-founders Ray Stata, (SB, SM) and Matthew Lorber (SB)\n* BlackRock, 1988, co-founder Bennett Golub, (SB, SM, PhD)\n* Bose Corporation, 1964, founder Amar Bose (SB, PhD)\n* Buzzfeed, 2006, co-founder Jonah Peretti (SM)\n* Dropbox, 2007, founders Drew Houston (SB) and Arash Ferdowsi (drop-out)\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939, co-founder William R.

However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993.[349]\n\n\nMany upperclass students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring known as the \"Brass Rat\".[350][351] Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the \"Standard Technology Ring\".[352] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver.[350] The initialism IHTFP, representing the informal school motto \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" and jocularly euphemized as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute Has The Finest Professors\", \"Institute of Hacks, TomFoolery and Pranks\", \"It's Hard to Fondle Penguins\", and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture.[353]\n\n\n\n### Caltech Rivalry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Caltech–MIT rivalry\n\nMIT also shares a well-known rivalry with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), stemming from both institutions' reputations as two of the highest ranked and most highly recognized science and engineering schools in the world.[354] The rivalry is an unusual college rivalry given its focus on academics and pranks instead of sports, and due to the geographic distance between the two (their campuses are separated by about 2580 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States). In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. The cannon was relocated to Cambridge, where it was displayed in front of the Green Building during the 2006 Campus Preview Weekend.[358][359] In September 2010, MIT students unsuccessfully tried to place a life-sized model of the TARDIS time machine from the *Doctor Who* (1963–present) television series on top of Baxter Hall at Caltech. A few months later, Caltech students collaborated to help MIT students place the TARDIS on top of their originally planned destination.[360] The rivalry has continued, most recently in 2014, when a group of Caltech students gave out mugs sporting the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turned orange and read, \"Caltech, The Hotter Institute of Technology.\"[361]\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Traditions and student activities at MIT\n\nSee also: Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The start of the MIT Mystery Hunt in 2007\nMIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups,[362] including a campus radio station, *The Tech* student newspaper, an annual entrepreneurship competition, a crime club, and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee. Less traditional activities include the \"world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction\" in English, a model railroad club, and a vibrant folk dance scene. Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum, Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center.[363]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities provide a base of activities in addition to housing. Approximately 1,000 undergrads, 48% of men and 30% of women, participate in one of several dozen Greek Life men's, women's and co-ed chapters on the campus.[364]\n\n\nThe Independent Activities Period is a four-week-long \"term\" offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are Autonomous Robot Design (course 6.270), Robocraft Programming (6.370), and MasLab competitions,[365] the annual \"mystery hunt\",[366] and Charm School.[367][368] More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad.[369][370]\n\n\nMany MIT students also engage in \"hacking\", which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as elaborate practical jokes.[371][372] Examples of high-profile hacks have included the abduction of Caltech's cannon,[373] reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome,[374] and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chief's Mjölnir Helmet.[375]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MIT Engineers\n\n![](image)The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center houses a two-story fitness center as well as swimming and diving pools.\nMIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs.[376][377] MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, NCAA's Division I Patriot League for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). The intercollegiate sports teams, called the MIT Engineers won 22 Team National Championships, 42 Individual National Championships. MIT is the all-time Division III leader in producing Academic All-Americas (302) and rank second across all NCAA Divisions only behind the University of Nebraska.[378] MIT Athletes won 13 Elite 90 awards and ranks first among NCAA Division III programs, and third among all divisions.[379] In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling.[380][381]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[382] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian | 32%\n | 32 |\n| White | 26%\n | 26 |\n| Hispanic | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[f] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[g] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[h] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nMIT enrolled 4,602 undergraduates and 6,972 graduate students in 2018–2019.[383] Undergraduate and graduate students came from all 50 US states as well as from 115 foreign countries.[384]\n\n\nMIT received 33,240 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2025: it admitted 1,365 (4.1 percent).[385] In 2019, 29,114 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree programs across all departments; 3,670 were admitted (12.6 percent) and 2,312 enrolled (63 percent).[386]\n\n\nUndergraduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was $53,790 for nine months. 59% of students were awarded a need-based MIT scholarship. Graduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was also $53,790 for nine months, and summer tuition was $17,800. Financial support for graduate students are provided in large part by individual departments. They include fellowships, traineeships, teaching and research assistantships, and loans.[387] The annual increase in expenses had led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek \"tuition riots\".[388]\n\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Between 1964 and 2009 a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT won Nobel Prizes (thirteen of them in the latter 25 years).[396] As of October 2020, 37 MIT faculty members, past or present, have won Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.[397]\n\n\nAs of October 2013[update], current faculty and teaching staff included 67 Guggenheim Fellows, 6 Fulbright Scholars, and 22 MacArthur Fellows.[4] Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures. Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, served as MIT's president from 2004 to 2012. She was the first woman to hold the post.[171]\n\n\nMIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty-member Charles W. Eliot became president of Harvard University in 1869, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence both on American higher education and on secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.\n\n\nAs of 2014[update] former provost Robert A. Brown served as president of Boston University; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University; and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST. Former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004–2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008–2013); former professor David Baltimore was president of Caltech (1997–2006); and MIT alumnus and former assistant professor Hans Mark served as chancellor of the University of Texas system (1984–1992).\n\n\nIn addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor Marcia McNutt is president of the National Academy of Sciences,[398] urban studies professor Xavier de Souza Briggs served as the associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,[399] and biology professor Eric Lander was a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[400] In 2013, faculty member Ernest Moniz was nominated by President Obama and later confirmed as United States Secretary of Energy.[401][402] Former professor Hans Mark served as Secretary of the Air Force from 1979 to 1981. Alumna and Institute Professor Sheila Widnall served as Secretary of the Air Force between 1993 and 1997, making her the first female Secretary of the Air Force and first woman to lead an entire branch of the US military in the Department of Defense. A 1999 report, met by promises of change by President Charles Vest, found that senior female faculty in the School of Science were often marginalized, and in return for equal professional accomplishments received reduced \"salary, space, awards, resources, and response to outside offers\".[403]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], MIT was the second-largest employer in the city of Cambridge.[128] Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked No. 7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of March 2013[update].[404] Surveys cited a \"smart\", \"creative\", \"friendly\" environment, noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a \"strong work ethic\" but complaining about \"low pay\" compared to an industry position.[405]\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

As of October 2020[update], 41 MIT alumni have won Nobel Prizes, 48 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars,[406] 61 have been selected as Marshall Scholars,[407] and 3 have been selected as Mitchell Scholars.[408]\n\n\nAlumni in United States politics and public service include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, former MA-1 Representative John Olver, former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark, Representative Thomas Massie, Senator Alex Padilla, former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers,[409] and former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Christina Romer. MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi,[410] former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband, former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, former Minister of Education and Culture of The Republic of Indonesia Yahya Muhaimin, former Jordanian Minister of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research and former Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Khaled Toukan. Alumni in sports have included Olympic fencing champion Johan Harmenberg.\nMIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Apotex, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, \"a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year\". If the companies founded by MIT alumni were a country, they would have the 11th-highest GDP of any country in the world.[411][412][413]\n\n\nMIT alumni have led prominent institutions of higher education, including the University of California system, Harvard University, the New York Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Carnegie Mellon University, Tufts University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Tel Aviv University, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Purdue University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, KAIST, and Quaid-e-Azam University. Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, was founded and led by MIT alumnus Lawrence Berk for more than three decades.\n\n\nMore than one third of the United States' crewed spaceflights have included MIT-educated astronauts, a contribution exceeding that of any university excluding the United States service academies.[414] Of the 12 people who have set foot on the Moon as of 2019[update], four graduated from MIT (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin). Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen led the Chinese nuclear-weapons program and became instrumental in Chinese rocket-program.[415]\n\n\nNoted alumni in non-scientific fields include author Hugh Lofting,[416] sculptor Daniel Chester French, guitarist Tom Scholz of the band Boston, the British *BBC* and *ITN* correspondent and political advisor David Walter, *The New York Times* columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, *The Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, United States Supreme Court building architect Cass Gilbert,[417]\nPritzker Prize-winning architects I.M.
