It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009–2011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\nThe first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation's first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana's First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey Brown became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey's unexpected death in office. Humphrey Brown was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota to fill her late husband's Senate seat; she served for less than one year and did not seek to be elected to her husband's seat.\n\n\nIn 1978, Nancy Kassebaum became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate, representing Kansas, without her husband having previously served in Congress.[n 1] Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Florida Republican Paula Hawkins, elected in 1980. She was also the first and, to date, only female member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \"Year of the Woman.\"[1] Barbara Mikulski was reelected and four new Democratic women were elected to the Senate. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Barbara Boxer of California. Carol Moseley Braun was the first woman of color to serve in the Senate and the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator after she won the 1992 Democratic primary election over Alan Dixon. Later in 1992, Feinstein was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated John Seymour in a special election. Feinstein entered the Senate the same year as the first female Jewish senator.[2][3][4]\n\n\nBathroom facilities for women in the Senate on the Senate chamber level were first provided in 1992.[5] Women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993.[6][7] In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.[6][7]\n\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n![](image)Eight Democratic women senators appear at the 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver. It has become a tradition at Democratic conventions for incumbent women senators to appear on opening night.Olympia Snowe of Maine arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the US House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and later Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, Stabenow and Maria Cantwell became the first women to defeat incumbent *elected* senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively.[n 2] Hillary Clinton is the first and only First Lady to run for or win a Senate seat. Clinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate.[14] In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. \n\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party's nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.\n\n\nStarting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona's first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year's special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.\n\n\nAlso in 2018, Jacky Rosen made political history as the first female one-term outgoing U.S. representative ever elected to the Senate.[15]\n\n\nIn 2023, Patty Murray became the first woman to serve as president pro tempore, a role traditionally given to the most senior member of the majority party in the United States Senate. Dianne Feinstein was the most senior Democratic senator, but declined to serve. This made Murray the third person in line to become president, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House.[16]\n\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president—see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRecent examples of selection include Jean Carnahan and Lisa Murkowski. In 2000, Jean Carnahan (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, Mel Carnahan. Carnahan—even though dead—defeated the incumbent senator, John Ashcroft. Carnahan's widow was named to fill his seat by Missouri Governor Roger Wilson until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent 2002 election to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski, who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her retention bid in 2004.\n\n\nTwo recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), was married to former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and served as Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), wife of former President Bill Clinton, was First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an unsuccessful campaign for her party's presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the secretary of state for the eventual victor of that election, Barack Obama. In 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(lifespan) | State\n | Term\n | Entered by\n | Left for\n | Party\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term start\n | Term end\n | Length ofservice (days)\n |\n| ![Sen.

This is the second-highest number of women to have served concurrently in the Senate in U.S. history. Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. On December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators.

afterward, rules were changed so that a senator has the right to bring a child under one year old on the Senate floor and breastfeed him or her during votes.[22] The day after those rules were changed, Maile became the first baby on the Senate floor when Duckworth brought her.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Widow's

Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \nOf the female senators who preceded Kassebaum:\nRebecca Latimer Felton, Rose McConnell Long, Dixie Bibb Graves, Vera C. Bushfield, Eva Bowring, Elaine S. Edwards, Muriel Humphrey, and Maryon Pittman Allen were all appointed and were never elected; Gladys Pyle (R-SD) and Hazel Abel (R-NE), were elected, but not to full terms (i.e., to complete terms where the previous senator had died or resigned, not to new six-year terms); Hattie Caraway and Maurine Brown Neuberger were both elected to full six-year terms, but their husbands had held the seat previously. Margaret Chase Smith's (R-ME) husband never served in the Senate, but he did serve in the House. When he died, Margaret won the ensuing election. Of the appointed senators, Long, Bushfield, Humphrey, and Allen were all appointed to fill out part of the terms of their deceased husbands, while Graves and Edwards were appointed by their husbands, the governor of their states at the time. However, Kassebaum's father was a former governor of Kansas, which means that the first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Paula Hawkins, who was elected in 1980 to represent Florida.\n2. **^** Bob Krueger and John F. Seymour, defeated by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein respectively, were appointed to the Senate by the governors of their states.\n3. **^** Latimer Felton was the oldest woman appointed to the Senate (at age 87)  \nShortest-serving woman in the Senate\n4. **^** Succeeded her late husband  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed her spouse  \nFirst woman re-elected to the Senate\n5. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n6. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n7. **^** Abel resigned 3 days before the end of her term, a common practice to give her successor seniority advantage.\n8. **^** Followed her late husband (although she did not directly succeed him)\n9. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n10. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Predecessor resigned early to give successor seniority advantage, so the senator was appointed for the few days prior to the commencement of the elected term\n12. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n13. **^** First non-Christian (Jewish) woman elected to the Senate\n14. **^** First African-American woman elected to the Senate\n15. **^** Lincoln was the first youngest woman to hold the distinction of \"youngest member of the Senate\" (at age 38)  \nLincoln was also the youngest woman elected to the Senate (at age 38)\n16. **^** Succeeded her father  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed a living parent\n17. **^** Married to Bob Dole\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** When Kay Hagan defeated Elizabeth Dole, it was the first time in history a woman candidate defeated an incumbent woman.\n19. **^** First openly LGBT and lesbian woman elected to the Senate\n20. **^** First Asian-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Japanese-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Buddhist woman elected to the Senate\n21. **^** First Hispanic and Latina American woman elected to the Senate\n22. **^** First woman with a disability elected to the Senate  \nFirst Southeast Asian-American (Thai) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Amerasian or Eurasian woman elected to the Senate\n23. **^** First South Asian-American (Indian) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Jamaican American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst woman of African-American and South Asian descent elected to the Senate\n24. **^** Blackburn was the oldest woman at the time of first election to the Senate (at 66 years and 5 months).\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018, but switched to an independent in December 2022.\n26. **^** First openly LGBT woman of color appointed to the Senate  \nFirst LGBT African American woman appointed to the Senate\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".

The state has had senators since the 1st Congress. Its Senate seats were declared vacant in Mar 1861 owing to its secession from the Union. They were again filled from February 1871.\n\n\nUnited States senators are popularly elected to six-year terms that begin on January 3 of the year after their election. Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Before 1914, Georgia's senators were chosen by the Georgia General Assembly, and before 1935, their terms began March 4. Popular Senate elections remained despite the General Assembly not taking action to ratify the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that was passed in 1913.\n\n\nRebecca Latimer Felton was the first female U.S. senator, representing Georgia in the Senate for one day in 1922,[1] having been appointed to the seat to replace the late Thomas E. Watson.\n\n\nRichard Russell Jr. was the state's longest serving senator, served from 1933 to 1971.\n\n\nSince January 20, 2021, Georgia has been represented in the Senate by Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Ossoff defeated Republican David Perdue in the regularly-scheduled 2020 election, while Warnock defeated appointed Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler in the concurrent special election, both of which were decided in runoffs on January 5, 2021. Ossoff is the first Jewish senator from Georgia and Warnock the first black senator from Georgia.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## List of senators[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  **Class 2**Class 2 U.S. senators belong to the electoral cycle that has recently been contested in 2002, 2008, 2014, and 2020.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served three terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 78th district, and from 1999 to 2013 represented Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. In 2012, Baldwin was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Republican nominee Tommy Thompson. In 2018, Baldwin was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Leah Vukmir. On April 12, 2023, Baldwin announced her candidacy for reelection in the 2024 Senate election in Wisconsin.[1]\n\n\nBaldwin, who is a lesbian, became the first openly LGBT woman elected to the House of Representatives and to the Senate in 1999 and 2013, respectively.[2][3][4][5] She was also the first woman to be elected to either chamber from Wisconsin.[2][3] Baldwin identifies as a progressive,[6][7] and she has a consistent progressive voting record.[8][9] She supports Medicare for All,[10] LGBTQ rights,[11] and gun control,[12] and opposed the Iraq War.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early political career[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin was born and grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. Her mother, who died in 2017, was 19 and going through a divorce when Baldwin was born. Baldwin was raised by her grandparents and spent Saturdays with her mother, who suffered from mental illness and opioid addiction.[14] Her maternal grandfather, biochemist David E. Green, was Jewish (the son of immigrants from Russia and Germany), and her maternal grandmother, who was Anglican, was English-born.[15] Baldwin's aunt is biochemist Rowena Green Matthews. Through her maternal grandfather, Baldwin is a third cousin of comedian Andy Samberg.[16][17]\n\n\nBaldwin graduated from Madison West High School in 1980 as the class valedictorian. She earned a B.A. from Smith College in 1984 and a J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1989.[18] She was a lawyer in private practice from 1989 to 1992.[19]\n\n\nBaldwin was first elected to political office in 1986 at the age of 24, when she was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, a position she held until 1994.[13] She also served one year on the Madison Common Council to fill a vacancy in the coterminous district.[20]\n\n\n\n## Wisconsin Assembly (1993–1999)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Baldwin ran to represent Wisconsin's 78th Assembly district in western Madison. She won the Democratic primary with 43% of the vote.[21] In the general election, Baldwin defeated Mary Kay Baum (Labor and Farm Party nominee) and Patricia Hevenor (Republican Party nominee) by a vote of 59%-23%-17%.[22] She was one of just six openly gay political candidates nationwide to win a general election in 1992.[23]\n\n\nIn 1994, Baldwin won election to a second term with 76% of the vote.[24] In 1996, she was elected to a third term with 71% of the vote.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin was the first openly lesbian member of the Wisconsin Assembly and one of a very few openly gay politicians in the country at the time. In 1993, she said she was disappointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton's support of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.[26] In early 1994, she proposed legalizing same-sex marriage in Wisconsin.[27][28] In 1995, she proposed domestic partnerships in Wisconsin.[29]\n\n\nBaldwin opposes capital punishment in Wisconsin.[30]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Criminal Justice Committee[31]\n* Education Committee (Chair)[32]\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin presiding over the House while serving as Speaker Pro Tempore\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, U.S. Congressman Scott Klug of the 2nd district, based in Madison, announced he would retire, prompting Baldwin to run for the seat. She won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 37% of the vote.[33] In the general election she defeated Republican nominee Josephine Musser 53%-47%.[34]\n\n\nBaldwin was the first woman elected to Congress from Wisconsin. She was also the first openly gay non-incumbent elected to the House of Representatives, and the first open lesbian elected to Congress.[3][4] In 2008, Baldwin and Representative Barney Frank co-founded the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, Baldwin won reelection to a second term, defeating Republican John Sharpless 51%-49%, a difference of 8,902 votes. She lost eight of the district's nine counties, but carried the largest, Dane County, with 55% of the vote.[36]\n\n\nAfter the 2000 census the 2nd district was made significantly more Democratic in redistricting. Baldwin won reelection to a third term in the newly redrawn 2nd district with 66% of the vote against Republican Ron Greer.[37] In 2004, she beat Dave Magnum 63%-37%.[38] She won a 2006 rematch against Magnum, again winning 63%-37%.[39] In 2008, she defeated Peter Theron 69%-31%,[40] and in 2010 she won a seventh term with 62% of the vote against Chad Lee.[41]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Energy and Commerce\n\t+ Subcommittee on Environment and Economy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin\n\n![](image)Baldwin and Thompson debating during the 2012 election\nBaldwin ran as the Democratic nominee against Republican nominee Tommy Thompson, who had formerly been governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services. She announced her candidacy on September 6, 2011, in a video emailed to supporters.[42] She ran uncontested in the primary election,[43] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention about tax policy, campaign finance reform, and equality in the United States.[44]\n\n\nShe was endorsed by Democracy for America, and she received campaign funding from EMILY's List, the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, and LPAC.[45] Baldwin was endorsed by the editorial board of *The Capital Times*, who wrote that \"Baldwin's fresh ideas on issues ranging from job creation to health care reform, along with her proven record of working across lines of partisanship and ideology, and her grace under pressure mark her as precisely the right choice to replace retiring U.S. Senator Herb Kohl\".[46]\n\n\nThompson claimed during his campaign that her \"far-left approach leaves this country in jeopardy\".[47]\n\n\nThe candidates had three debates, on September 28,[48][49] October 18,[50] and October 26.[51] According to Baldwin's Federal Election Commission filings, she raised about $12 million, over $5 million more than her opponent.[52]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Baldwin became the first openly gay candidate to be elected to the U.S. Senate, with 51.4% of the vote. Because of her 14 years in the House of Representatives, under Senate rules she had the highest seniority in her entering class of senators.[53] She was succeeded in Congress by State Assemblyman Mark Pocan, who had earlier succeeded her in the state legislature.\n\n\nBaldwin was featured in *Time's* November 19, 2012, edition, in the Verbatim section, where she was quoted as saying \"I didn't run to make history\" on her historic election.[54] In a separate section, she was also mentioned as a new face to watch in the Senate.[55]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Wisconsin\n\nBaldwin won a second term in 2018 with 55.4% of the vote, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir by a margin of approximately 11%.[56]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations[57]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Defense\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, Climate Change and Manufacturing (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freight, Freight, and Ports\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Baldwin served on the advisory committee of the Progressive Majority, a political action committee dedicated to electing progressive candidates to public office.[58]\n\n\nIn October 2012, Baldwin described herself as a progressive in the mold of Robert M. La Follette.[6] In 2013, she and Wisconsin's senior U.S Senator Ron Johnson split on votes more frequently than any other Senate duo from the same state.[59]\n\n\nBaldwin is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus[60] and the Afterschool Caucuses.[61] According to a 2011 National Journal survey, she was among the most liberal members of the House.[9] As of 2012, her voting record made her one of the most liberal members of Congress.[8][62][58][63]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Baldwin and eight other Democratic senators sent United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue a letter that criticized the USDA for purchasing pork from JBS USA and called it \"counterproductive and contradictory\" for companies to receive funding from \"U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration's trade policy.\" The senators requested that the department \"ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer’s bottom line—not the business interests of foreign corporations.\"[64]\n\n\n\n### Antitrust, competition, and corporate regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Baldwin was one of six Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar who signed letters to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice recounting that many of them had \"called on both the FTC and the Justice Department to investigate potential anticompetitive activity in these markets, particularly following the significant enforcement actions taken by foreign competition enforcers against these same companies\" and requesting that each agency confirm whether it had opened antitrust investigations into each of the companies and that each agency pledge it would publicly release any such investigation's findings.[65]\n\n\n\n### Economy and jobs[edit]\n\n\nIn a September 2015 radio interview, Baldwin said that she, the Pope, and Donald Trump all supported repeal of the carried interest tax loophole. Politifact stated that \"while Pope Francis has called for helping the poor and addressing economic inequality, we could not find that has spoken out on this particular tax break.\"[66]\n\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business-oriented lobbying group that usually supports Republican candidates, gave Baldwin a 32% cumulative score on \"key business votes.\"[67]\n\n\nIn October 2017, CBS News reported that the Freedom Partners, a Koch-funded group, had \"launched a $1.6 million television and digital ad campaign\" targeting Baldwin for her \"stance on taxes.\" The ads charged her with having \"voted for five trillion dollars in more taxes\" and with having \"supported higher income taxes, sales taxes—even energy taxes.\" One ad stated: \"If Tammy Baldwin opposes tax reform, it's proof that she opposes jobs.\"[68]\n\n\nIn October 2017 the editors of *The Capital Times* praised Baldwin and Bernie Sanders for their vocal opposition to a budget resolution that they believed would increase income inequality. Baldwin was described as \"one of the budget's most ardent foes.\"[69]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Baldwin expressed opposition to the Trump tax-reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that it was being drafted \"behind closed doors\" and charging that it was being \"shoved through.\" In its place she promoted the Stronger Way Act, a bill that she and Cory Booker (D-NJ) co-sponsored.[70]\n\n\nIn 2018, Baldwin sponsored the Reward Work Act of 2018, which proposed to guarantee the right of employees in listed companies to elect one-third of the board of directors.[71]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Baldwin signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) make a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's that detailed instances of workplace violence, such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms. The senators argued that McDonald's could and should \"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace.\"[72]\n\n\n\n### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Baldwin introduced a bill that would \"bring greater government transparency, oversight and due process whenever authorities use information gathered for intelligence purposes to make domestic non-terrorism cases against Americans.\"[73]\n\n\nBaldwin described the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016 as a \"hate crime\"[74] and said \"The question now for America is are we going to come together and stand united against hate, gun violence and terrorism?\"[75]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin voted against building a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border in 2006.[76] In June 2013, she voted for S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which would have enabled undocumented immigrants to acquire legal residency status and, later, citizenship.[77] She voted against Kate's Law in 2016.[78]\n\n\nIn 2017, NumbersUSA, an immigration reduction advocacy group, gave Baldwin an overall grade of F, with a score of 11% on immigration bills. On the reduction of unnecessary worker visas, she scored a C; on the reduction of refugee and asylum fraud, and on the reduction of amnesty enticements, she scored an F-.[79]\n\n\n\n### Opposition to Iraq War[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin was a vocal critic of the Iraq War.[13][80] On October 10, 2002, she was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. She warned there would be \"postwar challenges,\" observing that \"there is no history of democratic government in Iraq,\" that its \"economy and infrastructure are in ruins after years of war and sanctions,\" and that rebuilding would take \"a great deal of money.\"[81] In 2005, she joined the Out of Iraq Caucus.[82]\n\n\n\n### Impeachment of Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales[edit]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2007, Baldwin cosponsored H. Res. 333, a bill proposing articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney, and H Res. 589, a bill proposing the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. On January 20, 2008, Baldwin wrote in the *Milwaukee Journal Sentinel* that on December 14, 2007, \"I joined with my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee, Reps. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), in urging Chairman Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) to conduct hearings on a resolution of impeachment now pending consideration in that committee.\" Although some constituents \"say I have gone too far,\" others \"argue I have not gone far enough\" and feel \"we are losing our democracy and that I should do more to hold the Bush administration accountable for its actions.\"[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin speaks during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nAn outspoken advocate of single-payer, government-run universal health care system since her days as a state legislator, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, which would have required states to provide such a system, in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005.[13][80][84][85][86] The bill died each time it was introduced without a House vote.[87]\n\n\nShe has said that she \"believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system.\"[87] In November 2009, Baldwin voted for the version of health-care reform that included a public option, a government-run health-care plan that would have competed with private insurers, but only the House passed that version. She ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which became law in 2010.[13][88] Baldwin said she hoped a public option in the ACA would lead to a single-payer system. The first version of the ACA Baldwin voted for included a public option, but the final version did not.[87]\n\n\nIn 2009, Baldwin introduced the Ending LGBT Health Disparities Act (ELHDA), which sought to advance LGBT health priorities by promoting research, cultural competency, and non-discrimination policies. The bill was not passed.[89]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Baldwin was one of five Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump warning that failure \"to take immediate action to oppose the lawsuit or direct House Republicans to forgo this effort will increase instability in the insurance market, as insurers may choose not to participate in the marketplace in 2018\" and that they remained concerned that his administration \"has still not provided certainty to insurers and consumers that you will protect the cost-sharing subsidies provided under the law.\"[90]\n\n\nBaldwin wrote an op-ed in 2017 titled \"Why I support Medicare for all and other efforts to expand health coverage.\"[10]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Baldwin was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased Obamacare subsidies and rendered people with higher incomes eligible for its assistance.[91]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Baldwin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the shutdown's effect on public health and employees while remaining alarmed \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[92]\n\n\nIn February 2019 Baldwin was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi about their increased insulin prices depriving patients of \"access to the life-saving medications they need.\"[93]\n\n\nIn July 2019 Baldwin was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), a bill intended to strengthen training for new and existing physicians, people who teach palliative care, and other providers who are on the palliative care team that grants patients and their families a voice in their care and treatment goals.[94]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Baldwin was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[95]\n\n\n\n### Resolution on 9/11 victims[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin speaking at a U.S. Department of Justice event.\nBaldwin was one of 22 members of Congress to vote against a 2006 9/11 memorial bill; she said she \"voted against the bill because Republicans had inserted provisions praising the Patriot Act and hard-line immigration measures\".[96][97] She voted nine times in favor of other similar bills.[98]\n\n\nHer vote received renewed attention in the 2012 U.S. Senate campaign when Tommy Thompson's campaign released an ad about it, which Politifact rated \"Mostly False\".[98] Thompson said, \"Wisconsin voters need to know that Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin put her extreme views above honoring the men and women who were murdered by the terrorists in the Sept. 11 attacks on our nation.\"[96] Politifact stated, \"Thompson said his Democratic challenger voted against a resolution honoring 9/11 victims. Technically, he's correct. Baldwin voted against the measure in 2006—and criticized Republicans for adding in references to the Patriot Act, immigration bills, and other controversial matters. But Baldwin has voted nine times in favor of similar resolutions, and the day before the vote in question supported creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site. Thompson's statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.\"[98]\n\n\n\n### ACORN[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, when the House voted overwhelmingly to defund ACORN, Baldwin was one of 75 House members (all Democrats) who voted against the measure.[99]\n\n\n\n### 2016 U.S. presidential election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin with former Governor of Georgia and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in February 2017\nOn October 20, 2013, Baldwin was one of sixteen female Democratic Senators to sign a letter endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.[100]\n\n\n\n### Handling of Veterans Affairs report[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2015 *USA Today* obtained a copy of a report by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general about the Tomah, Wisconsin Veterans Affairs medical facility. The report said that two physicians at the Tomah VA were among the biggest prescribers of opioids in a multi-state region, raising \"potentially serious concerns.\" Baldwin's office had received the report in August 2014 but did not take action until January 2015, when Baldwin called for an investigation after the Center for Investigative Reporting published details of the report, including information about a veteran who died from an overdose at the facility. A whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee learned that Baldwin's office had a copy of the report, and he repeatedly emailed Baldwin's office asking that she take action on the issue. Baldwin's office did not explain why they waited from August 2014 to January 2015 to call for an investigation. Baldwin was the only member of Congress who had a copy of the inspection report.[101][102]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Baldwin fired her deputy state director over her handling of the VA report. The aide was offered but declined a severance deal that included a cash payout and a confidentiality agreement that would have required her to keep quiet. The aide filed an ethics complaint with the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The complaint was dismissed as lacking merit.[103] Baldwin said, \"we should have done a better job listening to and communicating with another constituent with whom we were working on problems at the VA\",[102] and that she had started a review of why her office had failed to act on the report. As a result of the review, Baldwin fined her chief of staff, demoted her state director, and reassigned a veterans' outreach staffer.[104] In November 2017, Baldwin co-sponsored legislation designed to strengthen opioid safety in the Department of Veterans Affairs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Baldwin was one of 17 senators to sign a letter to President-elect Trump asking him to fulfill a campaign pledge to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, stating their willingness \"to advance measures to achieve this goal\" and calling on Trump \"to partner with Republicans and Democrats alike to take meaningful steps to address the high cost of prescription drugs through bold administrative and legislative actions.\"[106]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Baldwin and thirty other senators signed a letter to Kaléo Pharmaceuticals in response to the opioid-overdose-reversing device Evzio rising in price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 and requested the company answer what the detailed price structure for Evzio was, the number of devices Kaléo Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the totality of federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year.[107]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Baldwin was one of six senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requesting their \"help in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the 340B program\", a Trump administration rule mandating that drug companies give discounts to health-care organizations presently serving large numbers of low-income patients.[108]\n\n\n\n### Central America[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Baldwin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[109]\n\n\n\n### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Baldwin was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressing their concern \"about credible allegations that the Trump campaign, transition team, and Administration has colluded with the Russian government, including most recently the events leading to the resignation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser.\" The senators requested the creation of \"an independent Special Counsel to investigate collusion with the Russian government by General Flynn and other Trump campaign, transition and Administrative officials\" in order to maintain \"the confidence, credibility and impartiality of the Department of Justice\".[110]\n\n\nIn December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Baldwin was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.[111]\n\n\n\n### Saudi Arabia[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Baldwin voted for a resolution by Rand Paul and Chris Murphy that would block Trump's $510 million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia that made up a portion of the $110 billion arms sale Trump announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia the previous year.[112][113]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Baldwin voted against tabling a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.[114] In December 2021, she voted for a resolution, opposed by a 67-30 majority, that would have blocked a $650 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia.[115]\n\n\n\n### Israel[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Baldwin voiced her opposition to Israel's plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.[116]\n\n\n\n### United States Postal Service[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Baldwin was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as a self-sustained establishment and noting concerns that privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for its customers, especially in rural communities.[117]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Baldwin was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to President Obama asserting that the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"in its current form will perpetuate a trade policy that advantages corporations at the expense of American workers\" and that there would be an \"erosion of U.S. manufacturing and middle class jobs, and accelerate the corporate race to the bottom\" if provisions were not fixed.[118]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Baldwin was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution in response to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action to address climate change.[119]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Baldwin was one of 69 members of the US House and Senate to sign a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.[120]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Baldwin was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQ individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"[11]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Baldwin was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Pompeo, requesting an explanation of a State Department decision not to issue an official statement that year commemorating Pride Month, nor to issue the annual cable outlining activities for embassies commemorating Pride Month. They also asked why the LGBTI special envoy position remained vacant and asserted that \"preventing the official flying of rainbow flags and limiting public messages celebrating Pride Month signals to the international community that the United States is abandoning the advancement of LGBTI rights as a foreign policy priority.\"[121]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Baldwin was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and \"the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it\" with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps \"to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public-health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.\"[122]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Baldwin was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, a bill to create a charge of domestic violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions must be reported to federal databases to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the UCMJ whereby convicted abusers retain the ability to purchase firearms.[123]\n\n\nIn 2018, Baldwin was a cosponsor of the NICS Denial Notification Act,[124] legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.[125]\n\n\n\n### Veterans[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Baldwin was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department warning that some payday lenders were \"offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law\" and asserting that service members and their families \"deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound.\"[126]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### U.S. House of Representatives (1998–2010)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Election\n | Date\n | Elected\n | Defeated\n | Total\n | Plurality\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[127] | Primary\n | Sep. 8 | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | 24,227\n | 37.09%\n | Richard J.

Green and the niece of another biochemist, Rowena Green Matthews.[135] Baldwin is also a third cousin of comedian and actor Andy Samberg.[136] For 15 years, Baldwin's domestic partner was Lauren Azar; in 2009, the couple registered as domestic partners in Wisconsin.[137] They separated in 2010.[138] Baldwin was baptized Episcopalian but considers herself \"unaffiliated\" with a religion.[139][140]\n\n\nBaldwin's real estate holdings total more than $2 million, including a rooftop condo in D.C. that she shares with her partner, Maria Brisbane.[141]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, *Queerty* named Baldwin one of 50 heroes \"leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\".[142][143]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Wells, Dylan (April 12, 2023). \"Democratic Sen.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served three terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly, representing the 78th district, and from 1999 to 2013 represented Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. In 2012, Baldwin was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Republican nominee Tommy Thompson. In 2018, Baldwin was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Leah Vukmir. On April 12, 2023, Baldwin announced her candidacy for reelection in the 2024 Senate election in Wisconsin.[1]\n\n\nBaldwin, who is a lesbian, became the first openly LGBT woman elected to the House of Representatives and to the Senate in 1999 and 2013, respectively.[2][3][4][5] She was also the first woman to be elected to either chamber from Wisconsin.[2][3] Baldwin identifies as a progressive,[6][7] and she has a consistent progressive voting record.[8][9] She supports Medicare for All,[10] LGBTQ rights,[11] and gun control,[12] and opposed the Iraq War.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early political career[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin was born and grew up in Madison, Wisconsin. Her mother, who died in 2017, was 19 and going through a divorce when Baldwin was born. Baldwin was raised by her grandparents and spent Saturdays with her mother, who suffered from mental illness and opioid addiction.[14] Her maternal grandfather, biochemist David E. Green, was Jewish (the son of immigrants from Russia and Germany), and her maternal grandmother, who was Anglican, was English-born.[15] Baldwin's aunt is biochemist Rowena Green Matthews. Through her maternal grandfather, Baldwin is a third cousin of comedian Andy Samberg.[16][17]\n\n\nBaldwin graduated from Madison West High School in 1980 as the class valedictorian. She earned a B.A. from Smith College in 1984 and a J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1989.[18] She was a lawyer in private practice from 1989 to 1992.[19]\n\n\nBaldwin was first elected to political office in 1986 at the age of 24, when she was elected to the Dane County Board of Supervisors, a position she held until 1994.[13] She also served one year on the Madison Common Council to fill a vacancy in the coterminous district.[20]\n\n\n\n## Wisconsin Assembly (1993–1999)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Baldwin ran to represent Wisconsin's 78th Assembly district in western Madison. She won the Democratic primary with 43% of the vote.[21] In the general election, Baldwin defeated Mary Kay Baum (Labor and Farm Party nominee) and Patricia Hevenor (Republican Party nominee) by a vote of 59%-23%-17%.[22] She was one of just six openly gay political candidates nationwide to win a general election in 1992.[23]\n\n\nIn 1994, Baldwin won election to a second term with 76% of the vote.[24] In 1996, she was elected to a third term with 71% of the vote.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin was the first openly lesbian member of the Wisconsin Assembly and one of a very few openly gay politicians in the country at the time. In 1993, she said she was disappointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton's support of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.[26] In early 1994, she proposed legalizing same-sex marriage in Wisconsin.[27][28] In 1995, she proposed domestic partnerships in Wisconsin.[29]\n\n\nBaldwin opposes capital punishment in Wisconsin.[30]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Criminal Justice Committee[31]\n* Education Committee (Chair)[32]\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1999–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin presiding over the House while serving as Speaker Pro Tempore\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, U.S. Congressman Scott Klug of the 2nd district, based in Madison, announced he would retire, prompting Baldwin to run for the seat. She won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 37% of the vote.[33] In the general election she defeated Republican nominee Josephine Musser 53%-47%.[34]\n\n\nBaldwin was the first woman elected to Congress from Wisconsin. She was also the first openly gay non-incumbent elected to the House of Representatives, and the first open lesbian elected to Congress.[3][4] In 2008, Baldwin and Representative Barney Frank co-founded the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, Baldwin won reelection to a second term, defeating Republican John Sharpless 51%-49%, a difference of 8,902 votes. She lost eight of the district's nine counties, but carried the largest, Dane County, with 55% of the vote.[36]\n\n\nAfter the 2000 census the 2nd district was made significantly more Democratic in redistricting. Baldwin won reelection to a third term in the newly redrawn 2nd district with 66% of the vote against Republican Ron Greer.[37] In 2004, she beat Dave Magnum 63%-37%.[38] She won a 2006 rematch against Magnum, again winning 63%-37%.[39] In 2008, she defeated Peter Theron 69%-31%,[40] and in 2010 she won a seventh term with 62% of the vote against Chad Lee.[41]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Energy and Commerce\n\t+ Subcommittee on Environment and Economy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Wisconsin\n\n![](image)Baldwin and Thompson debating during the 2012 election\nBaldwin ran as the Democratic nominee against Republican nominee Tommy Thompson, who had formerly been governor and Secretary of Health and Human Services. She announced her candidacy on September 6, 2011, in a video emailed to supporters.[42] She ran uncontested in the primary election,[43] and spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention about tax policy, campaign finance reform, and equality in the United States.[44]\n\n\nShe was endorsed by Democracy for America, and she received campaign funding from EMILY's List, the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, and LPAC.[45] Baldwin was endorsed by the editorial board of *The Capital Times*, who wrote that \"Baldwin's fresh ideas on issues ranging from job creation to health care reform, along with her proven record of working across lines of partisanship and ideology, and her grace under pressure mark her as precisely the right choice to replace retiring U.S. Senator Herb Kohl\".[46]\n\n\nThompson claimed during his campaign that her \"far-left approach leaves this country in jeopardy\".[47]\n\n\nThe candidates had three debates, on September 28,[48][49] October 18,[50] and October 26.[51] According to Baldwin's Federal Election Commission filings, she raised about $12 million, over $5 million more than her opponent.[52]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Baldwin became the first openly gay candidate to be elected to the U.S. Senate, with 51.4% of the vote. Because of her 14 years in the House of Representatives, under Senate rules she had the highest seniority in her entering class of senators.[53] She was succeeded in Congress by State Assemblyman Mark Pocan, who had earlier succeeded her in the state legislature.\n\n\nBaldwin was featured in *Time's* November 19, 2012, edition, in the Verbatim section, where she was quoted as saying \"I didn't run to make history\" on her historic election.[54] In a separate section, she was also mentioned as a new face to watch in the Senate.[55]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Wisconsin\n\nBaldwin won a second term in 2018 with 55.4% of the vote, defeating Republican Leah Vukmir by a margin of approximately 11%.[56]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations[57]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Defense\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, Climate Change and Manufacturing (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freight, Freight, and Ports\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Baldwin served on the advisory committee of the Progressive Majority, a political action committee dedicated to electing progressive candidates to public office.[58]\n\n\nIn October 2012, Baldwin described herself as a progressive in the mold of Robert M. La Follette.[6] In 2013, she and Wisconsin's senior U.S Senator Ron Johnson split on votes more frequently than any other Senate duo from the same state.[59]\n\n\nBaldwin is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus[60] and the Afterschool Caucuses.[61] According to a 2011 National Journal survey, she was among the most liberal members of the House.[9] As of 2012, her voting record made her one of the most liberal members of Congress.[8][62][58][63]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Baldwin and eight other Democratic senators sent United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue a letter that criticized the USDA for purchasing pork from JBS USA and called it \"counterproductive and contradictory\" for companies to receive funding from \"U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration's trade policy.\" The senators requested that the department \"ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer’s bottom line—not the business interests of foreign corporations.\"[64]\n\n\n\n### Antitrust, competition, and corporate regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Baldwin was one of six Democrats led by Amy Klobuchar who signed letters to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice recounting that many of them had \"called on both the FTC and the Justice Department to investigate potential anticompetitive activity in these markets, particularly following the significant enforcement actions taken by foreign competition enforcers against these same companies\" and requesting that each agency confirm whether it had opened antitrust investigations into each of the companies and that each agency pledge it would publicly release any such investigation's findings.[65]\n\n\n\n### Economy and jobs[edit]\n\n\nIn a September 2015 radio interview, Baldwin said that she, the Pope, and Donald Trump all supported repeal of the carried interest tax loophole. Politifact stated that \"while Pope Francis has called for helping the poor and addressing economic inequality, we could not find that has spoken out on this particular tax break.\"[66]\n\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a business-oriented lobbying group that usually supports Republican candidates, gave Baldwin a 32% cumulative score on \"key business votes.\"[67]\n\n\nIn October 2017, CBS News reported that the Freedom Partners, a Koch-funded group, had \"launched a $1.6 million television and digital ad campaign\" targeting Baldwin for her \"stance on taxes.\" The ads charged her with having \"voted for five trillion dollars in more taxes\" and with having \"supported higher income taxes, sales taxes—even energy taxes.\" One ad stated: \"If Tammy Baldwin opposes tax reform, it's proof that she opposes jobs.\"[68]\n\n\nIn October 2017 the editors of *The Capital Times* praised Baldwin and Bernie Sanders for their vocal opposition to a budget resolution that they believed would increase income inequality. Baldwin was described as \"one of the budget's most ardent foes.\"[69]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Baldwin expressed opposition to the Trump tax-reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying that it was being drafted \"behind closed doors\" and charging that it was being \"shoved through.\" In its place she promoted the Stronger Way Act, a bill that she and Cory Booker (D-NJ) co-sponsored.[70]\n\n\nIn 2018, Baldwin sponsored the Reward Work Act of 2018, which proposed to guarantee the right of employees in listed companies to elect one-third of the board of directors.[71]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Baldwin signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) make a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's that detailed instances of workplace violence, such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms. The senators argued that McDonald's could and should \"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace.\"[72]\n\n\n\n### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Baldwin introduced a bill that would \"bring greater government transparency, oversight and due process whenever authorities use information gathered for intelligence purposes to make domestic non-terrorism cases against Americans.\"[73]\n\n\nBaldwin described the mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016 as a \"hate crime\"[74] and said \"The question now for America is are we going to come together and stand united against hate, gun violence and terrorism?\"[75]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin voted against building a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border in 2006.[76] In June 2013, she voted for S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, which would have enabled undocumented immigrants to acquire legal residency status and, later, citizenship.[77] She voted against Kate's Law in 2016.[78]\n\n\nIn 2017, NumbersUSA, an immigration reduction advocacy group, gave Baldwin an overall grade of F, with a score of 11% on immigration bills. On the reduction of unnecessary worker visas, she scored a C; on the reduction of refugee and asylum fraud, and on the reduction of amnesty enticements, she scored an F-.[79]\n\n\n\n### Opposition to Iraq War[edit]\n\n\nBaldwin was a vocal critic of the Iraq War.[13][80] On October 10, 2002, she was among the 133 members of the House who voted against authorizing the invasion of Iraq. She warned there would be \"postwar challenges,\" observing that \"there is no history of democratic government in Iraq,\" that its \"economy and infrastructure are in ruins after years of war and sanctions,\" and that rebuilding would take \"a great deal of money.\"[81] In 2005, she joined the Out of Iraq Caucus.[82]\n\n\n\n### Impeachment of Dick Cheney and Alberto Gonzales[edit]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2007, Baldwin cosponsored H. Res. 333, a bill proposing articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney, and H Res. 589, a bill proposing the impeachment of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. On January 20, 2008, Baldwin wrote in the *Milwaukee Journal Sentinel* that on December 14, 2007, \"I joined with my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee, Reps. Robert Wexler (D-Fla.) and Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.), in urging Chairman Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) to conduct hearings on a resolution of impeachment now pending consideration in that committee.\" Although some constituents \"say I have gone too far,\" others \"argue I have not gone far enough\" and feel \"we are losing our democracy and that I should do more to hold the Bush administration accountable for its actions.\"[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin speaks during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nAn outspoken advocate of single-payer, government-run universal health care system since her days as a state legislator, Baldwin introduced the Health Security for All Americans Act, which would have required states to provide such a system, in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2005.[13][80][84][85][86] The bill died each time it was introduced without a House vote.[87]\n\n\nShe has said that she \"believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our health care system.\"[87] In November 2009, Baldwin voted for the version of health-care reform that included a public option, a government-run health-care plan that would have competed with private insurers, but only the House passed that version. She ultimately voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which became law in 2010.[13][88] Baldwin said she hoped a public option in the ACA would lead to a single-payer system. The first version of the ACA Baldwin voted for included a public option, but the final version did not.[87]\n\n\nIn 2009, Baldwin introduced the Ending LGBT Health Disparities Act (ELHDA), which sought to advance LGBT health priorities by promoting research, cultural competency, and non-discrimination policies. The bill was not passed.[89]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Baldwin was one of five Democratic senators to sign a letter to President Trump warning that failure \"to take immediate action to oppose the lawsuit or direct House Republicans to forgo this effort will increase instability in the insurance market, as insurers may choose not to participate in the marketplace in 2018\" and that they remained concerned that his administration \"has still not provided certainty to insurers and consumers that you will protect the cost-sharing subsidies provided under the law.\"[90]\n\n\nBaldwin wrote an op-ed in 2017 titled \"Why I support Medicare for all and other efforts to expand health coverage.\"[10]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Baldwin was one of ten senators to sponsor the Choose Medicare Act, an expanded public option for health insurance that also increased Obamacare subsidies and rendered people with higher incomes eligible for its assistance.[91]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Baldwin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the shutdown's effect on public health and employees while remaining alarmed \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[92]\n\n\nIn February 2019 Baldwin was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi about their increased insulin prices depriving patients of \"access to the life-saving medications they need.\"[93]\n\n\nIn July 2019 Baldwin was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), a bill intended to strengthen training for new and existing physicians, people who teach palliative care, and other providers who are on the palliative care team that grants patients and their families a voice in their care and treatment goals.[94]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Baldwin was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[95]\n\n\n\n### Resolution on 9/11 victims[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin speaking at a U.S. Department of Justice event.\nBaldwin was one of 22 members of Congress to vote against a 2006 9/11 memorial bill; she said she \"voted against the bill because Republicans had inserted provisions praising the Patriot Act and hard-line immigration measures\".[96][97] She voted nine times in favor of other similar bills.[98]\n\n\nHer vote received renewed attention in the 2012 U.S. Senate campaign when Tommy Thompson's campaign released an ad about it, which Politifact rated \"Mostly False\".[98] Thompson said, \"Wisconsin voters need to know that Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin put her extreme views above honoring the men and women who were murdered by the terrorists in the Sept. 11 attacks on our nation.\"[96] Politifact stated, \"Thompson said his Democratic challenger voted against a resolution honoring 9/11 victims. Technically, he's correct. Baldwin voted against the measure in 2006—and criticized Republicans for adding in references to the Patriot Act, immigration bills, and other controversial matters. But Baldwin has voted nine times in favor of similar resolutions, and the day before the vote in question supported creation of a memorial at the World Trade Center site. Thompson's statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical information that would give a different impression. That's our definition of Mostly False.\"[98]\n\n\n\n### ACORN[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, when the House voted overwhelmingly to defund ACORN, Baldwin was one of 75 House members (all Democrats) who voted against the measure.[99]\n\n\n\n### 2016 U.S. presidential election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Baldwin with former Governor of Georgia and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in February 2017\nOn October 20, 2013, Baldwin was one of sixteen female Democratic Senators to sign a letter endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential election.[100]\n\n\n\n### Handling of Veterans Affairs report[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2015 *USA Today* obtained a copy of a report by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general about the Tomah, Wisconsin Veterans Affairs medical facility. The report said that two physicians at the Tomah VA were among the biggest prescribers of opioids in a multi-state region, raising \"potentially serious concerns.\" Baldwin's office had received the report in August 2014 but did not take action until January 2015, when Baldwin called for an investigation after the Center for Investigative Reporting published details of the report, including information about a veteran who died from an overdose at the facility. A whistleblower and former Tomah VA employee learned that Baldwin's office had a copy of the report, and he repeatedly emailed Baldwin's office asking that she take action on the issue. Baldwin's office did not explain why they waited from August 2014 to January 2015 to call for an investigation. Baldwin was the only member of Congress who had a copy of the inspection report.[101][102]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Baldwin fired her deputy state director over her handling of the VA report. The aide was offered but declined a severance deal that included a cash payout and a confidentiality agreement that would have required her to keep quiet. The aide filed an ethics complaint with the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The complaint was dismissed as lacking merit.[103] Baldwin said, \"we should have done a better job listening to and communicating with another constituent with whom we were working on problems at the VA\",[102] and that she had started a review of why her office had failed to act on the report. As a result of the review, Baldwin fined her chief of staff, demoted her state director, and reassigned a veterans' outreach staffer.[104] In November 2017, Baldwin co-sponsored legislation designed to strengthen opioid safety in the Department of Veterans Affairs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Baldwin was one of 17 senators to sign a letter to President-elect Trump asking him to fulfill a campaign pledge to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, stating their willingness \"to advance measures to achieve this goal\" and calling on Trump \"to partner with Republicans and Democrats alike to take meaningful steps to address the high cost of prescription drugs through bold administrative and legislative actions.\"[106]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Baldwin and thirty other senators signed a letter to Kaléo Pharmaceuticals in response to the opioid-overdose-reversing device Evzio rising in price from $690 in 2014 to $4,500 and requested the company answer what the detailed price structure for Evzio was, the number of devices Kaléo Pharmaceuticals set aside for donation, and the totality of federal reimbursements Evzio received in the previous year.[107]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Baldwin was one of six senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer requesting their \"help in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the 340B program\", a Trump administration rule mandating that drug companies give discounts to health-care organizations presently serving large numbers of low-income patients.[108]\n\n\n\n### Central America[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Baldwin was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[109]\n\n\n\n### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Baldwin was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressing their concern \"about credible allegations that the Trump campaign, transition team, and Administration has colluded with the Russian government, including most recently the events leading to the resignation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser.\" The senators requested the creation of \"an independent Special Counsel to investigate collusion with the Russian government by General Flynn and other Trump campaign, transition and Administrative officials\" in order to maintain \"the confidence, credibility and impartiality of the Department of Justice\".[110]\n\n\nIn December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Baldwin was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.[111]\n\n\n\n### Saudi Arabia[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Baldwin voted for a resolution by Rand Paul and Chris Murphy that would block Trump's $510 million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia that made up a portion of the $110 billion arms sale Trump announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia the previous year.[112][113]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Baldwin voted against tabling a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.[114] In December 2021, she voted for a resolution, opposed by a 67-30 majority, that would have blocked a $650 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia.[115]\n\n\n\n### Israel[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Baldwin voiced her opposition to Israel's plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.[116]\n\n\n\n### United States Postal Service[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Baldwin was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as a self-sustained establishment and noting concerns that privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for its customers, especially in rural communities.[117]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Baldwin was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to President Obama asserting that the passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"in its current form will perpetuate a trade policy that advantages corporations at the expense of American workers\" and that there would be an \"erosion of U.S. manufacturing and middle class jobs, and accelerate the corporate race to the bottom\" if provisions were not fixed.[118]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Baldwin was one of 25 Democratic senators to cosponsor a resolution in response to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action to address climate change.[119]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Baldwin was one of 69 members of the US House and Senate to sign a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.[120]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Baldwin was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQ individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"[11]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Baldwin was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Pompeo, requesting an explanation of a State Department decision not to issue an official statement that year commemorating Pride Month, nor to issue the annual cable outlining activities for embassies commemorating Pride Month. They also asked why the LGBTI special envoy position remained vacant and asserted that \"preventing the official flying of rainbow flags and limiting public messages celebrating Pride Month signals to the international community that the United States is abandoning the advancement of LGBTI rights as a foreign policy priority.\"[121]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Baldwin was one of 18 senators to sign a letter to Thad Cochran and Barbara Mikulski requesting that the Labor, Health and Education subcommittee hold a hearing on whether to allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund a study of gun violence and \"the annual appropriations rider that some have interpreted as preventing it\" with taxpayer dollars. The senators noted their support for taking steps \"to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public-health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.\"[122]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Baldwin was a cosponsor of the Military Domestic Violence Reporting Enhancement Act, a bill to create a charge of domestic violence under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and stipulate that convictions must be reported to federal databases to keep abusers from purchasing firearms within three days in an attempt to close a loophole in the UCMJ whereby convicted abusers retain the ability to purchase firearms.[123]\n\n\nIn 2018, Baldwin was a cosponsor of the NICS Denial Notification Act,[124] legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.[125]\n\n\n\n### Veterans[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Baldwin was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department warning that some payday lenders were \"offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law\" and asserting that service members and their families \"deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound.\"[126]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### U.S. House of Representatives (1998–2010)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Election\n | Date\n | Elected\n | Defeated\n | Total\n | Plurality\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998[127] | Primary\n | Sep. 8 | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | 24,227\n | 37.09%\n | Richard J.

Green and the niece of another biochemist, Rowena Green Matthews.[135] Baldwin is also a third cousin of comedian and actor Andy Samberg.[136] For 15 years, Baldwin's domestic partner was Lauren Azar; in 2009, the couple registered as domestic partners in Wisconsin.[137] They separated in 2010.[138] Baldwin was baptized Episcopalian but considers herself \"unaffiliated\" with a religion.[139][140]\n\n\nBaldwin's real estate holdings total more than $2 million, including a rooftop condo in D.C. that she shares with her partner, Maria Brisbane.[141]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first LGBTQ Pride parade, *Queerty* named Baldwin one of 50 heroes \"leading the nation toward equality, acceptance, and dignity for all people\".[142][143]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** Wells, Dylan (April 12, 2023). \"Democratic Sen.

Blackburn was first elected to the Senate in 2018. A member of the Republican Party, Blackburn was a state senator from 1999 to 2003 and represented Tennessee's 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2019, during which time the *National Journal* rated her among the House's most conservative members.\n\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Blackburn became the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, defeating Democratic former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn became the state's senior senator in January 2021 upon the retirement of Senator Lamar Alexander. A supporter of the Tea Party movement, Blackburn is a staunch backer of former president Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![Black and white photograph of a young woman with 1960s style hair poses for the camera with a smile and her right hand under her chin](image)Marsha Wedgeworth as a junior at Northeast Jones High School in 1969\nMarsha Wedgeworth was born in Laurel, Mississippi, to Mary Jo (Morgan) and Hilman Wedgeworth, who worked in sales and management.[1] She placed fourth during a beauty pageant in high school.[2]\n\n\nBlackburn attended Mississippi State University on a 4-H scholarship, earning a Bachelor of Science in home economics in 1974.[3][4][5][6] Blackburn was a member of the Chi Omega sorority, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Little Sisters of Minerva (an auxiliary to a male fraternity) and was elected both as secretary and president of the Associated Women Students at Mississippi State University, wherein she worked to advance social issues through the AWS Zero Population Growth and the AWS venereal disease programs.[7][8][9]\n\n\n\n## Early career and political activity[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, before graduating from college, Blackburn worked as a sales manager for the Times Mirror Company. From 1975 to 1978, she worked in the Castner Knott Division of Mercantile Stores, Inc. In 1978, she became the owner of Marketing Strategies, a promotion-event management firm. As of 2016, Blackburn continued to run this business.[5]\n\n\nBlackburn was a founding member of the Williamson County Young Republicans.[6] She was chair of the Williamson County Republican Party from 1989 to 1991.[6][10][11] In 1992, she ran for Congress in Tennessee's 6th congressional district, losing to incumbent Bart Gordon, and was a delegate to the 1992 Republican National Convention.[6] In 1995, Blackburn was appointed executive director of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission by Tennessee governor Don Sundquist, holding that post through 1997.[12][6][13]\n\n\nBlackburn was a member of the Tennessee Senate from 1998 to 2003, and rose to be minority whip.[14][4] In 2000, she took part in the effort to prevent the passage of a state income tax bill.[6]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn and Donald Rumsfeld at Fort Campbell in 2004\n![](image)Blackburn with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2007\nRedistricting after the 2000 Census moved Blackburn's home from the 6th district into the 7th district, and created a gerrymandered district that stretched \"in reptilian fashion\" for 200 miles from eastern Memphis to southwest Nashville.[15][6] In 2002, Blackburn ran in the Republican primary for this congressional seat. Of the four main candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs. The other three (Mark Norris, David Kustoff, and Brent Taylor) were all from Memphis or its suburbs. Blackburn was endorsed by the conservative Club for Growth.[16] The three Memphians split the vote in that area, and she won the primary by nearly 20 percentage points.[17]\n\n\nIn the general election, Blackburn defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron with 70% of the vote.[18] She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, and the first woman elected to Congress from Tennessee who did not succeed her husband.[19] She was reelected seven times.[20]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2019.[21] During her House tenure, the *National Journal* rated her among the House's most conservative members.[6]\n\n\nIn November 2007, Blackburn unsuccessfully ran for Republican conference chair.[22][23][24] She was a senior advisor on Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, before resigning her position in the Romney campaign and endorsing Fred Thompson for president.[25][26] Blackburn was an assistant whip in Congress from 2003 to 2005, as well as deputy whip from 2005.[27][28][29][30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn with Eric Cantor, Mike Pence, and Cynthia Lummis at a press conference in 2010\n**Committee assignments**\n\n\n\n* Committee on the Budget[31]\n* Committee on Education and the Workforce[32]\n* Committee on Energy and Commerce[33]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, vice-chair\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications and the Internet, chair[29]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care[33]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,[33] vice-chair – Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade\n* Committee on Judiciary[32]\n* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform[32]\n* Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood, chair[34]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRep.

In her announcement, she said that House Republicans were frustrated with Senate Republicans, who they believed acted like Democrats on important issues, including Obamacare.[35][36] In the announcement, Blackburn called herself a \"hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative\", said she was \"politically incorrect\", and noted with pride that liberals had called her a \"wingnut\".[37] She dismissed compromise and bipartisanship, saying \"No compromise, no apologies.\"[37] She also said that she carried a gun in her purse.[37] On August 2, Blackburn received 610,302 votes (84.48%) in the Republican primary, winning the nomination.[38]\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn during the 116th Congress\nBlackburn largely backed President Donald Trump's policies,[39][40] including a U.S.–Mexico border wall,[41] and shared his opinion of National Football League national anthem protests.[42] Trump and Vice President Mike Pence endorsed her. During the campaign, Blackburn pledged to support Trump's agenda and suggested that Bredesen would not.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn's congressional campaign logo, used during the 2018 election\nFor most of the campaign, polls showed the two candidates nearly tied. But after Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Blackburn pulled ahead. Some believe the hearings mobilized Republican voters in the state,[44] even though Democrats won the House. Blackburn won the election with 54.7% of the vote to Bredesen's 43.9%, an unexpectedly large margin. She carried all but three counties in the state (Davidson, Shelby, and Haywood), the most counties ever won in an open Senate election in Tennessee.[45]\n\n\n\n### Senate tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Parts of this article (those related to Section) need to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(February 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn at Turning Point USA 2019\nBlackburn was sworn in as a U.S. senator on January 3, 2019. She is the first woman in history to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate.[46] Upon the retirement of Senator Lamar Alexander in 2021, Blackburn became the senior U.S. senator from Tennessee.[47]\n\n\n**Committee assignments[48]**\n\n\n\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Protection (Ranking Member)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, Climate Change and Manufacturing\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion\n* Committee on Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight\n* Committee on the Judiciary\n\t+ Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights\n\t+ Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law (Ranking)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Intellectual Property\n\t+ Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn is a Tea Party Republican.[49] She has been called staunchly conservative,[37][50][51][52] and has sometimes attended functions of, and met with leaders of, far-right groups.[53] She has called herself \"a hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\"[54]\n\n\nGovTrack estimated Blackburn to be the most ideologically conservative member of the Senate in the 2019 legislative year.[55]\n\n\n\n### Abortion and stem cell research[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposes abortion and sought to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.[56][57][37] In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans that would have prohibited abortions after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.[58] She replaced the bill's prior sponsor, U.S. Representative Trent Franks, after Franks made controversial and dubious statements.[59][60]\n\n\nIn 2015, Blackburn led a panel that investigated the Planned Parenthood undercover video controversy, in which anti-abortion activists published a video purporting to show that Planned Parenthood illicitly sold fetal tissue. Subsequent investigations into Planned Parenthood found no evidence of fetal tissue sales or of wrongdoing,[61] but in 2017, when Blackburn announced that she was running for Senate, she ran a controversial advertisement saying that she \"fought Planned Parenthood and we stopped the sale of baby body parts\".[61][62][63] In 2015, Blackburn claimed that 94% of Planned Parenthood's business revolves around abortion services, which FactCheck.org found to be \"wrong\" and that \"no one can say for sure what the percentage is\".[64]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Blackburn chaired the Republican-led Select Investigative Panel, a committee convened to \"explore the ethical implications of using fetal tissue in biomedical research\".[65] Democrats on the panel characterized the probe as a politically motivated witch hunt.[65]\n\n\n\n### Birth certificate bill[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Blackburn sponsored legislation requiring presidential candidates to show their birth certificates. The bill was in response to conspiracy theories, commonly known as \"birther\" theories, that alleged that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Her spokesperson said that Blackburn did not doubt that Obama was an American citizen.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn meeting with President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei, August 2022\nIn December 2020, Blackburn posted, \"China has a 5,000-year history of cheating and stealing. Some things will never change...\" on her Twitter account.[68][69] The European Union bureau chief for China's state-owned *China Daily*, Chen Weihua, responded by tweeting, \"This is the most racist and ignorant US Senator I have seen. A lifetime bitch\".[70][69] In what appeared to be a thinly veiled reference to Chen, Blackburn asserted in response that the U.S. would \"not bow down to sexist communist thugs\". One of Chen's tweets was, with an apparently sarcastic comment, retweeted by Republican Senator Marco Rubio.[71] The Chinese American rights group Tennessee Chinese American Alliance protested Blackburn's comments as insulting to people of Chinese descent.[72]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Blackburn led a congressional delegation to Taiwan, where she met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Her delegation was the third such delegation to visit Taiwan following Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit early that month. During her visit, Blackburn voiced support for Taiwan, calling it an \"independent nation\" and a \"country\", and also supported further U.S.-Taiwan relations and combating the \"New Axis of Evil\", which she defines as Iran, Russia, and North Korea, led by China. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and condemns most visits by U.S. lawmakers.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Blackburn criticized the movie *Barbie* for \"bending to Beijing to make a quick buck\" after it was alleged the film contained a map of the world displaying the nine-dash line, a territorial claim by China to the South China Sea that the international community rejects. In a statement addressing like criticisms, Warner Bros., *Barbie'*s production company, said the map was a \"child-like crayon drawing . . . not intended to make any type of statement\".[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In a 2014 debate with science communicator Bill Nye, Blackburn rejected the science and urgency of the issue, claiming that there is \"no consensus\" in the scientific community about the causes of climate change.[78]\n\n\n\n### Contraception and the right to privacy[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Blackburn called *Griswold v. Connecticut*, a landmark Supreme Court decision holding that the Constitution protects the liberty of married couples to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction, \"constitutionally unsound\" as a ruling that \"gave the court permission to bypass our system of checks and balances\".[79]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn strongly supports Donald Trump.[50]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Blackburn joined Trump's presidential transition team as vice chair.[80] She was a staunch supporter of his, and backed most of his policies and proposals.[37][40][54] She nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize for his negotiations with North Korea.[54][81] *Vox* speculated that Blackburn's ties to Trump, who won Tennessee in the 2016 election by 26 points, helped boost her Senate candidacy.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2016\n![](image)Blackburn and President Donald Trump waving at Nashville Rally in 2018\nDuring Trump's first Senate impeachment trial, Blackburn left the chamber for a television interview.[83] She also garnered attention by reading a book during the proceedings.[84] Blackburn spent time during the trial to tweet about Alexander Vindman, calling him unpatriotic for allegedly \"badmouth[ing] and ridicul[ing]\" the U.S. in front of Russia.[85][86] In November 2019, #MoscowMarcia started trending on Twitter after Blackburn tweeted allegations against Vindman on her Twitter account.[87] *The Week* characterized her tweet as a \"conspiratorial smear\".[88] In her post, she wrote \"Vindictive Vindman is the 'whistleblower's' handler\".[89] The tweet was in reference to Vindman, a decorated army official and Purple Heart veteran, who became a central figure in Trump's impeachment proceedings in Congress after testifying he heard Trump pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of one of his chief political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.[90]\n\n\nAfter Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, Blackburn supported Trump's false claims of victory and raised funds to support the Trump campaign's effort to overturn the election results in court.[91] In an interview on November 20, she briefly called Biden the \"president-elect\", but later retracted this as a mistake.[91] On January 2, 2021, Blackburn and 10 other Republican senators announced that they would vote to oppose certification of the results of the election on January 6, the joint session of Congress in which the certification of a presidential election occurs, citing false allegations of widespread election fraud, irregularities, and unconstitutional changes to voting laws and voting restrictions. But after a mob of Trump supporters violently stormed Capitol Hill that day, she voted to certify the results of the election.[92][93][94]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Blackburn abstained from voting on the creation of the January 6 commission.[95]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, when President Biden proposed universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds and subsidized child care for low- and middle-income families, Blackburn likened the proposal to the communist policies of the Soviet Union.[96] She also falsely claimed that the Biden administration proposed to put children in pre-K even if their parents did not want to send them there.[97]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which raised the U.S. debt ceiling.[98]\n\n\n\n### Guns[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2018 Thousand Oaks shooting on November 7, 2018, which resulted in 12 deaths, Blackburn responded to a question about the shooting in a Fox News interview by saying, \"how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment and protect our citizens? We've always done that in this country. Mental health issues need to be addressed.\"[99]\n\n\nIn March 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Blackburn for accepting over $1 million in campaign donations from the National Rifle Association of America and voting against gun control measures, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which passed in 2022.[100]\n\n\n\n### Health care and pharmaceuticals[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), saying upon its passage, \"freedom dies a little bit today.\"[37][101] She supported efforts to repeal the legislation.[102] In 2017, while arguing for its repeal, Blackburn falsely said that two of its popular provisions (protections for people with preexisting conditions and allowing adult children to be on their parents' health plans until they're 26) \"were two Republican provisions which made it into the bill.\"[103] In her declaration that she would run for the Senate in 2018, she said that the failure to repeal the ACA was \"a disgrace\".[104]\n\n\nAt October 2013 congressional hearings on the ACA, Blackburn said the website healthcare.gov violated HIPAA and health information privacy rights. The next day, when a CNN interviewer pointed out that the only health-related question the site asked was \"do you smoke?\", Blackburn repeated her criticism of the site for violating privacy rights.[105]\n\n\nAccording to *The New York Times* in 2017, Blackburn's best-known legislation was her co-sponsorship of a bill that revised the legal standard the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had used to establish that \"a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm that is more likely than not to occur\", rather than the previous tougher standard of \"imminent danger\", before suspending the manufacturer's opioid drug shipments.[106][54] The legislation passed the House and the Senate unanimously, but was criticized in internal Justice Department documents and by the DEA's chief administrative law judge as hampering DEA enforcement actions against drug distribution companies engaging in black-market sales.[106] Joe Rannazzisi, who had led the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, said he informed Blackburn's staffers what the effects of a 2016 law she co-sponsored would be. Blackburn said her bill had \"unintended consequences\", but Rannazzisi said they should have been anticipated. He said that during a July 2014 conference call he told congressional staffers the bill would cause more difficulties for the DEA if it pursued corporations that were illegally distributing such drugs.[107] Blackburn and Representative Tom Marino, the main co-sponsor of her House bill, sent a letter requesting an Office of Inspector General investigation about Rannazzisi, saying he tried to intimidate Congress in the July conversation. Rannazzisi said he was removed from his DEA position in August 2015.[107]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn supported Trump's 2017 executive order imposing a temporary travel and immigration ban barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.[108] She has often expressed support of Trump's immigration policy, especially his plan to greatly expand the Mexico–United States barrier.[109] In March 2021, Blackburn visited the southern border of the United States with several other Republican senators; she accused President Biden of encouraging a surge of illegal immigration.[110]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposes same-sex marriage[37][111] and in 2004 and 2006 voted for proposed constitutional amendments to ban it.[112] Of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, Blackburn said, \"Despite this decision, no one can overrule the truth about what marriage actually is—a sacred institution between a man and a woman.\"[113] In 2010, she voted against repealing the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.[114]\n\n\nDuring her tenure as a representative, Blackburn sought to remove Kevin Jennings, a gay man who worked in the United States Department of Education, saying that Jennings \"has played an integral role in promoting homosexuality and pushing a pro-homosexual agenda in America’s schools\".[115]\n\n\nIn 2013, Blackburn voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in the House,[116] but voted against the Senate's version of the act, which expanded VAWA to apply to people regardless of sexual orientation.[112] She argued that increasing the number of targets for VAWA funding would \"dilute the money that needs to go into the sexual assault centers, domestic abuse centers, [and] child advocacy centers\",[117] and said VAWA ought to remain focused on supporting women's shelters and facilitating law enforcement against crimes against women, rather than addressing other groups or issues.[118]\n\n\nBlackburn voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to ban discrimination against LGBT employees.[112] In August 2019, she co-signed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation or gender identity.[119][120]\n\n\n\n### SafeSport[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Blackburn requested feedback from gymnast Aly Raisman and others on the structural failures of Olympic sport sexual abuse investigations, writing, \"This was a systemic failure, and every single person in authority who turned a blind eye to your abuse must be held accountable\". She sent the United States Center for SafeSport a letter demanding answers to questions posed during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on sex offender Larry Nassar.[121]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court nominations[edit]\n\n\nOn October 26, 2020, Blackburn voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 52-48.[122] Blackburn wore a mask that read \"Grin and Barrett\" to the Senate vote.[123]\n\n\nOn March 22, 2022, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, Blackburn asked Jackson to define the word \"woman\". \"'I can’t—' Jackson replied. 'You can’t?' Blackburn said. 'Not in this context. I’m not a biologist,' Jackson said. 'The meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can’t give me a definition?' Blackburn asked.\"[124][125] On April 7, 2022, the Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court; Blackburn voted against Jackson's confirmation.[126]\n\n\n\n### Tech policy and antitrust[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn has advocated increased regulation of technology companies and criticized alleged anti-conservative bias on major platforms.[127] In June 2018, she published an op-ed arguing for greater oversight and restrictions on tech companies that sparked a vocal backlash among Google employees.[128] During a 2020 Commerce Committee hearing in which she claimed that tech companies stifle free speech, Blackburn asked Google chief Sundar Pichai about the employment status of an employee who had criticized her.[129][127][130]\n\n\nIn the 117th United States Congress, Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Open App Markets Act alongside Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar. The legislation is intended to curb Apple and Google, the operators of the App Store and Google Play, from engaging in anti-competitive behavior in app markets.[131][132] Blackburn also worked with Blumenthal to introduce children's online child safety legislation, known as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).[133]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications policy[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposes net neutrality in the United States, calling it \"socialistic\".[37][134] She opposes municipal broadband initiatives that aim to compete with Internet service providers.[135][136] She supported bills that restrict municipalities from creating their own broadband networks, and wrote a bill to prevent the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from preempting state laws that blocked municipal broadband.[137][138]\n\n\nIn 2017, Blackburn introduced to the House a measure to dismantle an Obama-administration online privacy rule that the FCC adopted in October 2016.[139] Her measure, which was supported by broadband providers but criticized by privacy advocates, repealed the rule that required broadband providers to obtain consumers' permission before sharing their online data, including browsing histories.[139][140] The measure passed the House in a party-line vote in March 2017, after a similar measure passed the Senate the same week.[139] She subsequently proposed legislation that expanded the requirement to include internet companies as well as broadband providers.[141] As of 2017, Blackburn had accepted at least $693,000 in campaign contributions from telecom companies.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Women's rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Blackburn voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act.[144]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn is married to Chuck Blackburn.[6] They live in Brentwood, a suburb of Nashville in Williamson County,[29] and have two children.[6] She is a Presbyterian and a member of Christ Presbyterian Church.[33]\n\n\nBlackburn is a member of The C Street Family, a prayer group that includes members of Congress.[145] She is a former member of the Smithsonian Libraries Advisory Board.[29]\n\n\nBlackburn is the author of *The Mind of a Conservative Woman: Seeking the Best for Family and Country*. The book was published on September 1, 2020, by Worthy Books.[146]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTennessee's 6th congressional district: 1992 results[147][a]\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992 |  | **Bart Gordon** | 120,177\n | 57%\n |  | Marsha Blackburn\n | 86,289\n | 41%\n |  | H.

Blackburn was first elected to the Senate in 2018. A member of the Republican Party, Blackburn was a state senator from 1999 to 2003 and represented Tennessee's 7th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2019, during which time the *National Journal* rated her among the House's most conservative members.\n\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Blackburn became the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Tennessee, defeating Democratic former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen. Blackburn became the state's senior senator in January 2021 upon the retirement of Senator Lamar Alexander. A supporter of the Tea Party movement, Blackburn is a staunch backer of former president Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![Black and white photograph of a young woman with 1960s style hair poses for the camera with a smile and her right hand under her chin](image)Marsha Wedgeworth as a junior at Northeast Jones High School in 1969\nMarsha Wedgeworth was born in Laurel, Mississippi, to Mary Jo (Morgan) and Hilman Wedgeworth, who worked in sales and management.[1] She placed fourth during a beauty pageant in high school.[2]\n\n\nBlackburn attended Mississippi State University on a 4-H scholarship, earning a Bachelor of Science in home economics in 1974.[3][4][5][6] Blackburn was a member of the Chi Omega sorority, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Little Sisters of Minerva (an auxiliary to a male fraternity) and was elected both as secretary and president of the Associated Women Students at Mississippi State University, wherein she worked to advance social issues through the AWS Zero Population Growth and the AWS venereal disease programs.[7][8][9]\n\n\n\n## Early career and political activity[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, before graduating from college, Blackburn worked as a sales manager for the Times Mirror Company. From 1975 to 1978, she worked in the Castner Knott Division of Mercantile Stores, Inc. In 1978, she became the owner of Marketing Strategies, a promotion-event management firm. As of 2016, Blackburn continued to run this business.[5]\n\n\nBlackburn was a founding member of the Williamson County Young Republicans.[6] She was chair of the Williamson County Republican Party from 1989 to 1991.[6][10][11] In 1992, she ran for Congress in Tennessee's 6th congressional district, losing to incumbent Bart Gordon, and was a delegate to the 1992 Republican National Convention.[6] In 1995, Blackburn was appointed executive director of the Tennessee Film, Entertainment, and Music Commission by Tennessee governor Don Sundquist, holding that post through 1997.[12][6][13]\n\n\nBlackburn was a member of the Tennessee Senate from 1998 to 2003, and rose to be minority whip.[14][4] In 2000, she took part in the effort to prevent the passage of a state income tax bill.[6]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn and Donald Rumsfeld at Fort Campbell in 2004\n![](image)Blackburn with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 2007\nRedistricting after the 2000 Census moved Blackburn's home from the 6th district into the 7th district, and created a gerrymandered district that stretched \"in reptilian fashion\" for 200 miles from eastern Memphis to southwest Nashville.[15][6] In 2002, Blackburn ran in the Republican primary for this congressional seat. Of the four main candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs. The other three (Mark Norris, David Kustoff, and Brent Taylor) were all from Memphis or its suburbs. Blackburn was endorsed by the conservative Club for Growth.[16] The three Memphians split the vote in that area, and she won the primary by nearly 20 percentage points.[17]\n\n\nIn the general election, Blackburn defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron with 70% of the vote.[18] She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, and the first woman elected to Congress from Tennessee who did not succeed her husband.[19] She was reelected seven times.[20]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 2003 to 2019.[21] During her House tenure, the *National Journal* rated her among the House's most conservative members.[6]\n\n\nIn November 2007, Blackburn unsuccessfully ran for Republican conference chair.[22][23][24] She was a senior advisor on Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, before resigning her position in the Romney campaign and endorsing Fred Thompson for president.[25][26] Blackburn was an assistant whip in Congress from 2003 to 2005, as well as deputy whip from 2005.[27][28][29][30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn with Eric Cantor, Mike Pence, and Cynthia Lummis at a press conference in 2010\n**Committee assignments**\n\n\n\n* Committee on the Budget[31]\n* Committee on Education and the Workforce[32]\n* Committee on Energy and Commerce[33]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, vice-chair\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications and the Internet, chair[29]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care[33]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,[33] vice-chair – Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade\n* Committee on Judiciary[32]\n* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform[32]\n* Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood, chair[34]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRep.

In her announcement, she said that House Republicans were frustrated with Senate Republicans, who they believed acted like Democrats on important issues, including Obamacare.[35][36] In the announcement, Blackburn called herself a \"hardcore, card-carrying Tennessee conservative\", said she was \"politically incorrect\", and noted with pride that liberals had called her a \"wingnut\".[37] She dismissed compromise and bipartisanship, saying \"No compromise, no apologies.\"[37] She also said that she carried a gun in her purse.[37] On August 2, Blackburn received 610,302 votes (84.48%) in the Republican primary, winning the nomination.[38]\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn during the 116th Congress\nBlackburn largely backed President Donald Trump's policies,[39][40] including a U.S.–Mexico border wall,[41] and shared his opinion of National Football League national anthem protests.[42] Trump and Vice President Mike Pence endorsed her. During the campaign, Blackburn pledged to support Trump's agenda and suggested that Bredesen would not.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn's congressional campaign logo, used during the 2018 election\nFor most of the campaign, polls showed the two candidates nearly tied. But after Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Blackburn pulled ahead. Some believe the hearings mobilized Republican voters in the state,[44] even though Democrats won the House. Blackburn won the election with 54.7% of the vote to Bredesen's 43.9%, an unexpectedly large margin. She carried all but three counties in the state (Davidson, Shelby, and Haywood), the most counties ever won in an open Senate election in Tennessee.[45]\n\n\n\n### Senate tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Parts of this article (those related to Section) need to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(February 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn at Turning Point USA 2019\nBlackburn was sworn in as a U.S. senator on January 3, 2019. She is the first woman in history to represent Tennessee in the U.S. Senate.[46] Upon the retirement of Senator Lamar Alexander in 2021, Blackburn became the senior U.S. senator from Tennessee.[47]\n\n\n**Committee assignments[48]**\n\n\n\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Protection (Ranking Member)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oceans, Fisheries, Climate Change and Manufacturing\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion\n* Committee on Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight\n* Committee on the Judiciary\n\t+ Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights\n\t+ Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law (Ranking)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Intellectual Property\n\t+ Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn is a Tea Party Republican.[49] She has been called staunchly conservative,[37][50][51][52] and has sometimes attended functions of, and met with leaders of, far-right groups.[53] She has called herself \"a hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative.\"[54]\n\n\nGovTrack estimated Blackburn to be the most ideologically conservative member of the Senate in the 2019 legislative year.[55]\n\n\n\n### Abortion and stem cell research[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposes abortion and sought to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.[56][57][37] In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans that would have prohibited abortions after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.[58] She replaced the bill's prior sponsor, U.S. Representative Trent Franks, after Franks made controversial and dubious statements.[59][60]\n\n\nIn 2015, Blackburn led a panel that investigated the Planned Parenthood undercover video controversy, in which anti-abortion activists published a video purporting to show that Planned Parenthood illicitly sold fetal tissue. Subsequent investigations into Planned Parenthood found no evidence of fetal tissue sales or of wrongdoing,[61] but in 2017, when Blackburn announced that she was running for Senate, she ran a controversial advertisement saying that she \"fought Planned Parenthood and we stopped the sale of baby body parts\".[61][62][63] In 2015, Blackburn claimed that 94% of Planned Parenthood's business revolves around abortion services, which FactCheck.org found to be \"wrong\" and that \"no one can say for sure what the percentage is\".[64]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Blackburn chaired the Republican-led Select Investigative Panel, a committee convened to \"explore the ethical implications of using fetal tissue in biomedical research\".[65] Democrats on the panel characterized the probe as a politically motivated witch hunt.[65]\n\n\n\n### Birth certificate bill[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Blackburn sponsored legislation requiring presidential candidates to show their birth certificates. The bill was in response to conspiracy theories, commonly known as \"birther\" theories, that alleged that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Her spokesperson said that Blackburn did not doubt that Obama was an American citizen.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn meeting with President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei, August 2022\nIn December 2020, Blackburn posted, \"China has a 5,000-year history of cheating and stealing. Some things will never change...\" on her Twitter account.[68][69] The European Union bureau chief for China's state-owned *China Daily*, Chen Weihua, responded by tweeting, \"This is the most racist and ignorant US Senator I have seen. A lifetime bitch\".[70][69] In what appeared to be a thinly veiled reference to Chen, Blackburn asserted in response that the U.S. would \"not bow down to sexist communist thugs\". One of Chen's tweets was, with an apparently sarcastic comment, retweeted by Republican Senator Marco Rubio.[71] The Chinese American rights group Tennessee Chinese American Alliance protested Blackburn's comments as insulting to people of Chinese descent.[72]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Blackburn led a congressional delegation to Taiwan, where she met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Her delegation was the third such delegation to visit Taiwan following Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit early that month. During her visit, Blackburn voiced support for Taiwan, calling it an \"independent nation\" and a \"country\", and also supported further U.S.-Taiwan relations and combating the \"New Axis of Evil\", which she defines as Iran, Russia, and North Korea, led by China. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and condemns most visits by U.S. lawmakers.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Blackburn criticized the movie *Barbie* for \"bending to Beijing to make a quick buck\" after it was alleged the film contained a map of the world displaying the nine-dash line, a territorial claim by China to the South China Sea that the international community rejects. In a statement addressing like criticisms, Warner Bros., *Barbie'*s production company, said the map was a \"child-like crayon drawing . . . not intended to make any type of statement\".[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In a 2014 debate with science communicator Bill Nye, Blackburn rejected the science and urgency of the issue, claiming that there is \"no consensus\" in the scientific community about the causes of climate change.[78]\n\n\n\n### Contraception and the right to privacy[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Blackburn called *Griswold v. Connecticut*, a landmark Supreme Court decision holding that the Constitution protects the liberty of married couples to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction, \"constitutionally unsound\" as a ruling that \"gave the court permission to bypass our system of checks and balances\".[79]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn strongly supports Donald Trump.[50]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Blackburn joined Trump's presidential transition team as vice chair.[80] She was a staunch supporter of his, and backed most of his policies and proposals.[37][40][54] She nominated him for a Nobel Peace Prize for his negotiations with North Korea.[54][81] *Vox* speculated that Blackburn's ties to Trump, who won Tennessee in the 2016 election by 26 points, helped boost her Senate candidacy.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackburn speaking at the Republican National Convention in 2016\n![](image)Blackburn and President Donald Trump waving at Nashville Rally in 2018\nDuring Trump's first Senate impeachment trial, Blackburn left the chamber for a television interview.[83] She also garnered attention by reading a book during the proceedings.[84] Blackburn spent time during the trial to tweet about Alexander Vindman, calling him unpatriotic for allegedly \"badmouth[ing] and ridicul[ing]\" the U.S. in front of Russia.[85][86] In November 2019, #MoscowMarcia started trending on Twitter after Blackburn tweeted allegations against Vindman on her Twitter account.[87] *The Week* characterized her tweet as a \"conspiratorial smear\".[88] In her post, she wrote \"Vindictive Vindman is the 'whistleblower's' handler\".[89] The tweet was in reference to Vindman, a decorated army official and Purple Heart veteran, who became a central figure in Trump's impeachment proceedings in Congress after testifying he heard Trump pressure the president of Ukraine to investigate the son of one of his chief political rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.[90]\n\n\nAfter Biden won the 2020 United States presidential election, Blackburn supported Trump's false claims of victory and raised funds to support the Trump campaign's effort to overturn the election results in court.[91] In an interview on November 20, she briefly called Biden the \"president-elect\", but later retracted this as a mistake.[91] On January 2, 2021, Blackburn and 10 other Republican senators announced that they would vote to oppose certification of the results of the election on January 6, the joint session of Congress in which the certification of a presidential election occurs, citing false allegations of widespread election fraud, irregularities, and unconstitutional changes to voting laws and voting restrictions. But after a mob of Trump supporters violently stormed Capitol Hill that day, she voted to certify the results of the election.[92][93][94]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Blackburn abstained from voting on the creation of the January 6 commission.[95]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, when President Biden proposed universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds and subsidized child care for low- and middle-income families, Blackburn likened the proposal to the communist policies of the Soviet Union.[96] She also falsely claimed that the Biden administration proposed to put children in pre-K even if their parents did not want to send them there.[97]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which raised the U.S. debt ceiling.[98]\n\n\n\n### Guns[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2018 Thousand Oaks shooting on November 7, 2018, which resulted in 12 deaths, Blackburn responded to a question about the shooting in a Fox News interview by saying, \"how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment and protect our citizens? We've always done that in this country. Mental health issues need to be addressed.\"[99]\n\n\nIn March 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized Blackburn for accepting over $1 million in campaign donations from the National Rifle Association of America and voting against gun control measures, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which passed in 2022.[100]\n\n\n\n### Health care and pharmaceuticals[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposed the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), saying upon its passage, \"freedom dies a little bit today.\"[37][101] She supported efforts to repeal the legislation.[102] In 2017, while arguing for its repeal, Blackburn falsely said that two of its popular provisions (protections for people with preexisting conditions and allowing adult children to be on their parents' health plans until they're 26) \"were two Republican provisions which made it into the bill.\"[103] In her declaration that she would run for the Senate in 2018, she said that the failure to repeal the ACA was \"a disgrace\".[104]\n\n\nAt October 2013 congressional hearings on the ACA, Blackburn said the website healthcare.gov violated HIPAA and health information privacy rights. The next day, when a CNN interviewer pointed out that the only health-related question the site asked was \"do you smoke?\", Blackburn repeated her criticism of the site for violating privacy rights.[105]\n\n\nAccording to *The New York Times* in 2017, Blackburn's best-known legislation was her co-sponsorship of a bill that revised the legal standard the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had used to establish that \"a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm that is more likely than not to occur\", rather than the previous tougher standard of \"imminent danger\", before suspending the manufacturer's opioid drug shipments.[106][54] The legislation passed the House and the Senate unanimously, but was criticized in internal Justice Department documents and by the DEA's chief administrative law judge as hampering DEA enforcement actions against drug distribution companies engaging in black-market sales.[106] Joe Rannazzisi, who had led the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, said he informed Blackburn's staffers what the effects of a 2016 law she co-sponsored would be. Blackburn said her bill had \"unintended consequences\", but Rannazzisi said they should have been anticipated. He said that during a July 2014 conference call he told congressional staffers the bill would cause more difficulties for the DEA if it pursued corporations that were illegally distributing such drugs.[107] Blackburn and Representative Tom Marino, the main co-sponsor of her House bill, sent a letter requesting an Office of Inspector General investigation about Rannazzisi, saying he tried to intimidate Congress in the July conversation. Rannazzisi said he was removed from his DEA position in August 2015.[107]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn supported Trump's 2017 executive order imposing a temporary travel and immigration ban barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.[108] She has often expressed support of Trump's immigration policy, especially his plan to greatly expand the Mexico–United States barrier.[109] In March 2021, Blackburn visited the southern border of the United States with several other Republican senators; she accused President Biden of encouraging a surge of illegal immigration.[110]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposes same-sex marriage[37][111] and in 2004 and 2006 voted for proposed constitutional amendments to ban it.[112] Of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, Blackburn said, \"Despite this decision, no one can overrule the truth about what marriage actually is—a sacred institution between a man and a woman.\"[113] In 2010, she voted against repealing the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.[114]\n\n\nDuring her tenure as a representative, Blackburn sought to remove Kevin Jennings, a gay man who worked in the United States Department of Education, saying that Jennings \"has played an integral role in promoting homosexuality and pushing a pro-homosexual agenda in America’s schools\".[115]\n\n\nIn 2013, Blackburn voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in the House,[116] but voted against the Senate's version of the act, which expanded VAWA to apply to people regardless of sexual orientation.[112] She argued that increasing the number of targets for VAWA funding would \"dilute the money that needs to go into the sexual assault centers, domestic abuse centers, [and] child advocacy centers\",[117] and said VAWA ought to remain focused on supporting women's shelters and facilitating law enforcement against crimes against women, rather than addressing other groups or issues.[118]\n\n\nBlackburn voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to ban discrimination against LGBT employees.[112] In August 2019, she co-signed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit employment discrimination based upon sexual orientation or gender identity.[119][120]\n\n\n\n### SafeSport[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Blackburn requested feedback from gymnast Aly Raisman and others on the structural failures of Olympic sport sexual abuse investigations, writing, \"This was a systemic failure, and every single person in authority who turned a blind eye to your abuse must be held accountable\". She sent the United States Center for SafeSport a letter demanding answers to questions posed during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on sex offender Larry Nassar.[121]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court nominations[edit]\n\n\nOn October 26, 2020, Blackburn voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court of the United States. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 52-48.[122] Blackburn wore a mask that read \"Grin and Barrett\" to the Senate vote.[123]\n\n\nOn March 22, 2022, during the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, Blackburn asked Jackson to define the word \"woman\". \"'I can’t—' Jackson replied. 'You can’t?' Blackburn said. 'Not in this context. I’m not a biologist,' Jackson said. 'The meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can’t give me a definition?' Blackburn asked.\"[124][125] On April 7, 2022, the Senate voted 53-47 to confirm Jackson to the Supreme Court; Blackburn voted against Jackson's confirmation.[126]\n\n\n\n### Tech policy and antitrust[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn has advocated increased regulation of technology companies and criticized alleged anti-conservative bias on major platforms.[127] In June 2018, she published an op-ed arguing for greater oversight and restrictions on tech companies that sparked a vocal backlash among Google employees.[128] During a 2020 Commerce Committee hearing in which she claimed that tech companies stifle free speech, Blackburn asked Google chief Sundar Pichai about the employment status of an employee who had criticized her.[129][127][130]\n\n\nIn the 117th United States Congress, Blackburn introduced the bipartisan Open App Markets Act alongside Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar. The legislation is intended to curb Apple and Google, the operators of the App Store and Google Play, from engaging in anti-competitive behavior in app markets.[131][132] Blackburn also worked with Blumenthal to introduce children's online child safety legislation, known as the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).[133]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications policy[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn opposes net neutrality in the United States, calling it \"socialistic\".[37][134] She opposes municipal broadband initiatives that aim to compete with Internet service providers.[135][136] She supported bills that restrict municipalities from creating their own broadband networks, and wrote a bill to prevent the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from preempting state laws that blocked municipal broadband.[137][138]\n\n\nIn 2017, Blackburn introduced to the House a measure to dismantle an Obama-administration online privacy rule that the FCC adopted in October 2016.[139] Her measure, which was supported by broadband providers but criticized by privacy advocates, repealed the rule that required broadband providers to obtain consumers' permission before sharing their online data, including browsing histories.[139][140] The measure passed the House in a party-line vote in March 2017, after a similar measure passed the Senate the same week.[139] She subsequently proposed legislation that expanded the requirement to include internet companies as well as broadband providers.[141] As of 2017, Blackburn had accepted at least $693,000 in campaign contributions from telecom companies.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Women's rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Blackburn voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act.[144]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nBlackburn is married to Chuck Blackburn.[6] They live in Brentwood, a suburb of Nashville in Williamson County,[29] and have two children.[6] She is a Presbyterian and a member of Christ Presbyterian Church.[33]\n\n\nBlackburn is a member of The C Street Family, a prayer group that includes members of Congress.[145] She is a former member of the Smithsonian Libraries Advisory Board.[29]\n\n\nBlackburn is the author of *The Mind of a Conservative Woman: Seeking the Best for Family and Country*. The book was published on September 1, 2020, by Worthy Books.[146]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTennessee's 6th congressional district: 1992 results[147][a]\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992 |  | **Bart Gordon** | 120,177\n | 57%\n |  | Marsha Blackburn\n | 86,289\n | 41%\n |  | H.

A member of the Democratic Party, Cortez Masto served as the 32nd attorney general of Nevada from 2007 to 2015.\n\n\nCortez Masto graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno and Gonzaga University School of Law. She worked four years as a civil attorney in Las Vegas and two years as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. before being elected Nevada attorney general in 2006, replacing George Chanos. Reelected in 2010, she was not eligible to run for a third term in 2014 because of lifetime term limits established by the Constitution of Nevada.\n\n\nCortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican Joe Heck in the 2016 United States Senate election in Nevada to replace outgoing Democratic senator Harry Reid, becoming the first woman elected to represent Nevada in the Senate and the first Latina elected to serve in the upper chamber.[1] She took office on January 3, 2017, and became Nevada's senior senator in January 2019, when Dean Heller left the Senate following his defeat. She was narrowly reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Adam Laxalt.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, the daughter of Joanna (née Musso) and Manny Cortez.[3] Her father, an attorney, was the longtime head of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and served as a member of the Clark County Commission.[4] Now deceased, Manny Cortez had a long-standing friendship with Harry Reid.[5] Her father was of Mexican descent, and her mother is of Italian ancestry.[6][7] Her paternal grandfather, Eduardo Cortez, immigrated to Nevada from Chihuahua, Mexico.[8][9][10]\n\n\nCortez Masto attended Ed W. Clark High School,[11] and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1986 and a Juris Doctor from Gonzaga University School of Law in 1990.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto was admitted to the State Bar of Nevada in 1990, the U.S. District Court, the District of Nevada in 1991, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1994. Her career includes four years as a civil attorney in Las Vegas and two as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. She also served as former Nevada Governor Bob Miller's chief of staff.[5]\n\n\nIn November 2003, Cortez Masto was named executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education. There was some controversy, because she was hired directly by the chancellor, not the university system's board of regents; the chancellor said the regents had recommended that he hire an assistant, and in December the board voted unanimously to approve her annual salary of $215,000.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Nevada Attorney General[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cortez Masto with then-California Attorney General (and later Senate colleague and vice president) Kamala Harris in December 2011\nCortez Masto was the Democratic nominee for state attorney general in 2006 and defeated Republican nominee Don Chairez 59% to 36%, with 5% for \"None of these\".[15] She was reelected in 2010, defeating Republican Travis Barrick 52% to 36%, with 8% for Independent American candidate Joel F. Hansen and 4% for \"None of these\".[16]\n\n\nIn 2009, Cortez Masto's office launched an investigation into Brian Krolicki, then Nevada's Republican lieutenant governor. Krolicki faced felony charges related to allegations that he mishandled the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund when he was state treasurer. During the investigation, the *Las Vegas Review-Journal* discovered that Cortez Masto's husband, Paul, planned to host a fundraising party for Robert S. Randazzo, a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, four days before the attorney general's office was scheduled to prosecute Krolicki. Cortez Masto said she was unaware of the fundraising party.[17] The charges against Krolicki were ultimately dismissed in Clark County District Court.[18] The dismissal of charges against Krolicki was regarded as a political setback for Cortez Masto, who, according to the *Las Vegas Sun*, \"opened herself to charges of politicizing her office and prosecutorial misconduct\".[19]\n\n\nIn 2010, Cortez Masto's office began investigating Bank of America, accusing the company of raising interest rates on troubled borrowers. Her office sought to end Nevada's participation in a loan modification settlement in order to sue the bank over deceptive marketing and lending practices. Bank of America denied any wrongdoing.[20] The lawsuit was settled in 2012 for $750 million for lien reductions and short sales.[21]\n\n\nCortez Masto defended the state of Nevada in the lawsuit *Sevcik v. Sandoval*. The suit challenged Nevada's denial of same-sex marriage, as prohibited by the state's constitution and statutory law. After initially defending the same-sex marriage ban,[22] Cortez Masto and the state abandoned their defense in light of a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cortez Masto being sworn in as a U.S. senator by Vice President Joe Biden\n![](image)Cortez Masto during the 115th Congress\n![](image)Maggie Hassan speaking with Cortez Masto at a Senate committee hearing in June 2017\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in Nevada\n\nCortez Masto declined to run for governor of Nevada in the 2014 election.[24] When U.S. Senator Harry Reid decided not to run for reelection in the 2016 election, he endorsed her as his successor.[5] Cortez Masto's campaign relied heavily on the political infrastructure Reid had assembled.[25] Her Republican opponent was U.S. Representative Joe Heck.\n\n\nCortez Masto, who supports increased investments in renewable energy technology, was supported by the League of Conservation Voters.[26] She was also financially supported by pro-choice groups, such as EMILY's List and Planned Parenthood, and by End Citizens United, a political action committee seeking to overturn *Citizens United v. FEC*.[27]\n\n\nCortez Masto won 47% of the vote (520,658 votes) to Heck's 45% (494,427 votes). While Heck carried 16 of Nevada's counties and its equivalents, Cortez Masto won Clark County, home to over 70% of the state's population, by over 82,000 votes, over three times her statewide margin of 27,000 votes.[1] She took office on January 3, 2017, becoming the first Latina in the U.S. Senate.[28]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Nevada\n\nOn February 24, 2021, Cortez Masto announced that she would run for reelection in 2022.[29] Among her challengers was her successor as attorney general and 2018 nominee for governor Adam Laxalt.[30] Cortez Masto trailed in many polls and was widely seen as the most vulnerable incumbent Democratic U.S. senator. But she narrowly defeated Laxalt, securing a second term.[2][31]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n117th Congress (2021–23)\nCortez Masto was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. She was on the Senate floor, preparing to speak, when the Capitol was breached. Cortez Masto could hear the attackers just outside the chamber, which was secured by Capitol Police. As the attackers neared the chamber, she and her fellow senators were moved to an undisclosed secure location.[32] Cortez Masto tweeted while sheltering in place, calling the attack \"un-American and unacceptable\".[33]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining (Chair)\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n* Special Committee on Aging\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Hispanic Caucus[34]\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nAs of October 2022, Cortez Masto has voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 92.9% of the time.[35]\n\n\n\n### Cannabis[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto cosponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th U.S. Congress by senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Gardner that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.[36]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto recognizes the existence of human-caused climate change and believes that the federal government should limit power plants' greenhouse gas emissions.[37] She supports the growth of green jobs and increasing Nevada's reliance on solar power and other forms of clean energy. She opposes the use of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository.[38]\n\n\n\n### Filibuster[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto supports reforming the filibuster of the United States Senate into a talking filibuster.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Cortez Masto condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[42]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Cortez Masto was one of 34 senators to sign a letter criticizing Donald Trump for cutting off foreign assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.[43]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nThe NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) has given Cortez Masto an F grade because of her support for gun control.[44] During the 2016 election, the organization spent $1 million on an attack ad against her.[45] Cortez Masto opposes allowing people on the terrorist watchlist to buy guns, saying that \"makes no sense\".[46]\n\n\nIn response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, she co-sponsored a bill with Dianne Feinstein to ban bump stocks. She said that it can be a start toward decreasing gun violence and mass shootings.[47]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto does not support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare).[37] She does support improving upon the act, which she has called \"imperfect\". She has co-sponsored the Marketplace Certainty Act to bring more stability to the health insurance marketplace.[48]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Cortez Masto was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee asking for increased funding for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building.[49]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Cortez Masto was one of five senators to send a letter to acting director of ICE Thomas Homan about the standards the agency uses to determine how to detain pregnant women.[50]\n\n\nIn June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Cortez Masto and 11 other senators introduced the Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to applicants' immigration status.[51]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Cortez Masto and 15 other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations, except in special circumstances, and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually on enforcement actions in those locations.[52]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto supports same-sex marriage.[37]\n\n\n\n### Reproductive rights[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto supports legalized abortion.[37] In the 2016 election, she was endorsed by Planned Parenthood and funded by their action fund.[53]\n\n\nShe does not believe that companies should be allowed to withhold coverage for birth control based on religious beliefs.[37]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto lives in Las Vegas with her husband, Paul Masto, a retired United States Secret Service special agent.[54] She is Roman Catholic.[55][56][57]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2010 Attorney General election in Nevada[58]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto**  | **372,010**  | **52.8%**  |\n|  | Republican | Travis Barrick\n | 251,269\n | 35.7%\n |  |\n|  | n/a | None of these Candidates | 26,072\n | 3.7%\n |  |\n|  | Independent | Joel Hansen\n | 54,980\n | 7.8%\n |  |\n| Total votes\n |  | **100%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n2016 United States Senate election in Nevada – Democratic primary\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto**  | **81,944**  | **81.0%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Allen Rheinhart\n | 5,645\n | 6.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | None of these candidates\n | 5,498\n | 5.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Liddo Susan O'Briant\n | 4,834\n | 5.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bobby Mahendra\n | 3,760\n | 3.0%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **101,681**  | **100.0%**  |\n\n\n\n\n2016 United States Senate election in Nevada[59]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto**  | **521,994**  | **47.10%**  | **−3.19%**  |\n|  | Republican | Joe Heck | 495,079\n | 44.67%\n | +0.12%\n |\n|  | n/a | None of these Candidates | 42,257\n | 3.81%\n | +1.56%\n |\n|  | Independent American | Tom Jones\n | 17,128\n | 1.55%\n | +1.11%\n |\n|  | Independent | Thomas Sawyer\n | 14,208\n | 1.28%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Tony Gumina\n | 10,740\n | 0.97%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Jarrod Williams\n | 6,888\n | 0.62%\n | N/A\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,108,294**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Nevada[60]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto (incumbent)**  | **498,316**  | **48.81%**  | **+1.71%**  |\n|  | Republican | Adam Laxalt | 490,388\n | 48.04%\n | +3.37%\n |\n|  | None of These Candidates | 12,441\n | 1.22%\n | -2.59%\n |\n|  | Independent | Barry Lindemann\n | 8,075\n | 0.79%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Neil Scott\n | 6,422\n | 0.63%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent American | Barry Rubinson\n | 5,208\n | 0.51%\n | -1.04%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,020,850**  | **100.0%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of female state attorneys general in the United States\n* List of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2016 Nevada Senate Election Results\". *Politico*.

A member of the Democratic Party, Cortez Masto served as the 32nd attorney general of Nevada from 2007 to 2015.\n\n\nCortez Masto graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno and Gonzaga University School of Law. She worked four years as a civil attorney in Las Vegas and two years as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. before being elected Nevada attorney general in 2006, replacing George Chanos. Reelected in 2010, she was not eligible to run for a third term in 2014 because of lifetime term limits established by the Constitution of Nevada.\n\n\nCortez Masto narrowly defeated Republican Joe Heck in the 2016 United States Senate election in Nevada to replace outgoing Democratic senator Harry Reid, becoming the first woman elected to represent Nevada in the Senate and the first Latina elected to serve in the upper chamber.[1] She took office on January 3, 2017, and became Nevada's senior senator in January 2019, when Dean Heller left the Senate following his defeat. She was narrowly reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Adam Laxalt.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, the daughter of Joanna (née Musso) and Manny Cortez.[3] Her father, an attorney, was the longtime head of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and served as a member of the Clark County Commission.[4] Now deceased, Manny Cortez had a long-standing friendship with Harry Reid.[5] Her father was of Mexican descent, and her mother is of Italian ancestry.[6][7] Her paternal grandfather, Eduardo Cortez, immigrated to Nevada from Chihuahua, Mexico.[8][9][10]\n\n\nCortez Masto attended Ed W. Clark High School,[11] and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the University of Nevada, Reno in 1986 and a Juris Doctor from Gonzaga University School of Law in 1990.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto was admitted to the State Bar of Nevada in 1990, the U.S. District Court, the District of Nevada in 1991, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1994. Her career includes four years as a civil attorney in Las Vegas and two as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C. She also served as former Nevada Governor Bob Miller's chief of staff.[5]\n\n\nIn November 2003, Cortez Masto was named executive vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education. There was some controversy, because she was hired directly by the chancellor, not the university system's board of regents; the chancellor said the regents had recommended that he hire an assistant, and in December the board voted unanimously to approve her annual salary of $215,000.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Nevada Attorney General[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cortez Masto with then-California Attorney General (and later Senate colleague and vice president) Kamala Harris in December 2011\nCortez Masto was the Democratic nominee for state attorney general in 2006 and defeated Republican nominee Don Chairez 59% to 36%, with 5% for \"None of these\".[15] She was reelected in 2010, defeating Republican Travis Barrick 52% to 36%, with 8% for Independent American candidate Joel F. Hansen and 4% for \"None of these\".[16]\n\n\nIn 2009, Cortez Masto's office launched an investigation into Brian Krolicki, then Nevada's Republican lieutenant governor. Krolicki faced felony charges related to allegations that he mishandled the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund when he was state treasurer. During the investigation, the *Las Vegas Review-Journal* discovered that Cortez Masto's husband, Paul, planned to host a fundraising party for Robert S. Randazzo, a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, four days before the attorney general's office was scheduled to prosecute Krolicki. Cortez Masto said she was unaware of the fundraising party.[17] The charges against Krolicki were ultimately dismissed in Clark County District Court.[18] The dismissal of charges against Krolicki was regarded as a political setback for Cortez Masto, who, according to the *Las Vegas Sun*, \"opened herself to charges of politicizing her office and prosecutorial misconduct\".[19]\n\n\nIn 2010, Cortez Masto's office began investigating Bank of America, accusing the company of raising interest rates on troubled borrowers. Her office sought to end Nevada's participation in a loan modification settlement in order to sue the bank over deceptive marketing and lending practices. Bank of America denied any wrongdoing.[20] The lawsuit was settled in 2012 for $750 million for lien reductions and short sales.[21]\n\n\nCortez Masto defended the state of Nevada in the lawsuit *Sevcik v. Sandoval*. The suit challenged Nevada's denial of same-sex marriage, as prohibited by the state's constitution and statutory law. After initially defending the same-sex marriage ban,[22] Cortez Masto and the state abandoned their defense in light of a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cortez Masto being sworn in as a U.S. senator by Vice President Joe Biden\n![](image)Cortez Masto during the 115th Congress\n![](image)Maggie Hassan speaking with Cortez Masto at a Senate committee hearing in June 2017\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in Nevada\n\nCortez Masto declined to run for governor of Nevada in the 2014 election.[24] When U.S. Senator Harry Reid decided not to run for reelection in the 2016 election, he endorsed her as his successor.[5] Cortez Masto's campaign relied heavily on the political infrastructure Reid had assembled.[25] Her Republican opponent was U.S. Representative Joe Heck.\n\n\nCortez Masto, who supports increased investments in renewable energy technology, was supported by the League of Conservation Voters.[26] She was also financially supported by pro-choice groups, such as EMILY's List and Planned Parenthood, and by End Citizens United, a political action committee seeking to overturn *Citizens United v. FEC*.[27]\n\n\nCortez Masto won 47% of the vote (520,658 votes) to Heck's 45% (494,427 votes). While Heck carried 16 of Nevada's counties and its equivalents, Cortez Masto won Clark County, home to over 70% of the state's population, by over 82,000 votes, over three times her statewide margin of 27,000 votes.[1] She took office on January 3, 2017, becoming the first Latina in the U.S. Senate.[28]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Nevada\n\nOn February 24, 2021, Cortez Masto announced that she would run for reelection in 2022.[29] Among her challengers was her successor as attorney general and 2018 nominee for governor Adam Laxalt.[30] Cortez Masto trailed in many polls and was widely seen as the most vulnerable incumbent Democratic U.S. senator. But she narrowly defeated Laxalt, securing a second term.[2][31]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n117th Congress (2021–23)\nCortez Masto was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. She was on the Senate floor, preparing to speak, when the Capitol was breached. Cortez Masto could hear the attackers just outside the chamber, which was secured by Capitol Police. As the attackers neared the chamber, she and her fellow senators were moved to an undisclosed secure location.[32] Cortez Masto tweeted while sheltering in place, calling the attack \"un-American and unacceptable\".[33]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests and Mining (Chair)\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n* Special Committee on Aging\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Hispanic Caucus[34]\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nAs of October 2022, Cortez Masto has voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 92.9% of the time.[35]\n\n\n\n### Cannabis[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto cosponsored the bipartisan STATES Act proposed in the 115th U.S. Congress by senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Gardner that would exempt individuals or corporations in compliance with state cannabis laws from federal enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act.[36]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto recognizes the existence of human-caused climate change and believes that the federal government should limit power plants' greenhouse gas emissions.[37] She supports the growth of green jobs and increasing Nevada's reliance on solar power and other forms of clean energy. She opposes the use of Yucca Mountain as a nuclear waste repository.[38]\n\n\n\n### Filibuster[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto supports reforming the filibuster of the United States Senate into a talking filibuster.[39][40][41]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Cortez Masto condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[42]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Cortez Masto was one of 34 senators to sign a letter criticizing Donald Trump for cutting off foreign assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.[43]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nThe NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) has given Cortez Masto an F grade because of her support for gun control.[44] During the 2016 election, the organization spent $1 million on an attack ad against her.[45] Cortez Masto opposes allowing people on the terrorist watchlist to buy guns, saying that \"makes no sense\".[46]\n\n\nIn response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, she co-sponsored a bill with Dianne Feinstein to ban bump stocks. She said that it can be a start toward decreasing gun violence and mass shootings.[47]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto does not support the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare).[37] She does support improving upon the act, which she has called \"imperfect\". She has co-sponsored the Marketplace Certainty Act to bring more stability to the health insurance marketplace.[48]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Cortez Masto was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee asking for increased funding for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building.[49]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Cortez Masto was one of five senators to send a letter to acting director of ICE Thomas Homan about the standards the agency uses to determine how to detain pregnant women.[50]\n\n\nIn June 2019, following the Housing and Urban Development Department's confirmation that DACA recipients did not meet eligibility for federal backed loans, Cortez Masto and 11 other senators introduced the Home Ownership Dreamers Act, legislation that mandated that the federal government was not authorized to deny mortgage loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Agriculture Department solely due to applicants' immigration status.[51]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Cortez Masto and 15 other Senate Democrats introduced the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, which mandated that ICE agents get approval from a supervisor ahead of engaging in enforcement actions at sensitive locations, except in special circumstances, and that agents receive annual training in addition to being required to report annually on enforcement actions in those locations.[52]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto supports same-sex marriage.[37]\n\n\n\n### Reproductive rights[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto supports legalized abortion.[37] In the 2016 election, she was endorsed by Planned Parenthood and funded by their action fund.[53]\n\n\nShe does not believe that companies should be allowed to withhold coverage for birth control based on religious beliefs.[37]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nCortez Masto lives in Las Vegas with her husband, Paul Masto, a retired United States Secret Service special agent.[54] She is Roman Catholic.[55][56][57]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2010 Attorney General election in Nevada[58]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto**  | **372,010**  | **52.8%**  |\n|  | Republican | Travis Barrick\n | 251,269\n | 35.7%\n |  |\n|  | n/a | None of these Candidates | 26,072\n | 3.7%\n |  |\n|  | Independent | Joel Hansen\n | 54,980\n | 7.8%\n |  |\n| Total votes\n |  | **100%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n2016 United States Senate election in Nevada – Democratic primary\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto**  | **81,944**  | **81.0%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Allen Rheinhart\n | 5,645\n | 6.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | None of these candidates\n | 5,498\n | 5.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Liddo Susan O'Briant\n | 4,834\n | 5.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bobby Mahendra\n | 3,760\n | 3.0%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **101,681**  | **100.0%**  |\n\n\n\n\n2016 United States Senate election in Nevada[59]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto**  | **521,994**  | **47.10%**  | **−3.19%**  |\n|  | Republican | Joe Heck | 495,079\n | 44.67%\n | +0.12%\n |\n|  | n/a | None of these Candidates | 42,257\n | 3.81%\n | +1.56%\n |\n|  | Independent American | Tom Jones\n | 17,128\n | 1.55%\n | +1.11%\n |\n|  | Independent | Thomas Sawyer\n | 14,208\n | 1.28%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Tony Gumina\n | 10,740\n | 0.97%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Jarrod Williams\n | 6,888\n | 0.62%\n | N/A\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,108,294**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Nevada[60]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Catherine Cortez Masto (incumbent)**  | **498,316**  | **48.81%**  | **+1.71%**  |\n|  | Republican | Adam Laxalt | 490,388\n | 48.04%\n | +3.37%\n |\n|  | None of These Candidates | 12,441\n | 1.22%\n | -2.59%\n |\n|  | Independent | Barry Lindemann\n | 8,075\n | 0.79%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Neil Scott\n | 6,422\n | 0.63%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent American | Barry Rubinson\n | 5,208\n | 0.51%\n | -1.04%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,020,850**  | **100.0%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of female state attorneys general in the United States\n* List of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2016 Nevada Senate Election Results\". *Politico*.

A member of the Democratic Party, she represented Illinois's 8th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017.\n\n\nBorn in Bangkok, Thailand and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Duckworth was educated at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and George Washington University in Washington, D.C. A combat veteran of the Iraq War, she served as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot. In 2004, when her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents, she lost both legs and some mobility in her right arm. She was the first female double amputee from the war.[3] Despite her injuries, she was awarded a medical waiver to continue serving in the Illinois Army National Guard for another ten years until she retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2014.\n\n\nDuckworth ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2006, then served as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs from 2006 to 2009 and as assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs from 2009 to 2011. In 2012, Duckworth was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she served two terms. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, defeating Republican incumbent Mark Kirk.[4]\n\n\nDuckworth is the first Thai American woman elected to Congress, the first person born in Thailand elected to Congress, the first woman with a disability elected to Congress, the first female double amputee in the Senate, and the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth is the second of three Asian American women to serve in the U.S. Senate, after Mazie Hirono, and before Kamala Harris.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth was born in Bangkok, Thailand, the daughter of Franklin Duckworth and his wife Lamai Sompornpairin.[6] Her father, who died in 2005,[7] was a veteran of the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps[8] who traced his family's roots to the American Revolutionary War.[9] Duckworth is also descended from Henry Coe, her 6th-great grandfather, who owned four slaves and bequeathed them their freedom at set ages (one at 40 and three at 36) in his 1827 will; according to Duckworth, although \"gut wrenching\" . . . \"it's a disservice to our nation and our history to walk away from this [fact]. If I am going to claim—and be proud that—I am a Daughter of the American Revolution, then I have to acknowledge that I am also a daughter of people who enslaved other people\".[10] Her mother is Thai Chinese[11] and originally from Chiang Mai.[12] Her father was a Baptist,[13] who after his military service worked with the United Nations and international companies in refugee, housing, and development programs.[14] As the family moved around Southeast Asia for her father's work, Duckworth became fluent in Thai and Indonesian, in addition to English.[15]\n\n\nDuckworth attended American curriculum based schools: Singapore American School, the International School Bangkok, and the Jakarta International School.[16][17] The family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, when Duckworth was 16, and she attended Honolulu's McKinley High School, where she participated in track and field and graduated in 1985.[18] Because of a difference in the grade levels between the school systems she attended, Duckworth skipped half of her ninth grade year and half of her tenth.[19] She was a Girl Scout, and earned her First Class, now called the Gold Award.[20] Her father was unemployed for a time, and the family relied on public assistance.[14] She graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. In 1992, she received a Master of Arts in international affairs from George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.[21][22]\n\n\nLater, Duckworth began a PhD program at Northern Illinois University, with interests in public health and the politics of southeast Asia, which was interrupted by her war service.[23] She completed a PhD in human services at Capella University School of Public Service Leadership in March 2015.[24][25] Her dissertation was titled *Exploring Illinois physicians' experience using electronic medical records (EMR) via the UTAUT model*.[25] Julia Moore was her faculty mentor.[25]\n\n\n\n## Military service[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Captain Duckworth in 2000\nFollowing in the footsteps of her father, who served in World War II and the Vietnam War,[8] and ancestors who served in every major conflict since the Revolutionary War,[9] Duckworth joined the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps[26] in 1990 as a graduate student at George Washington University.[27][28] She became a commissioned officer in the United States Army Reserve in 1992 and chose to fly helicopters[26] because it was one of the few combat jobs open to women at that time.[29] As a member of the Army Reserve, she went to flight school, later transferring to the Army National Guard and in 1996 entering the Illinois Army National Guard.[26] Duckworth also worked as a staff supervisor at Rotary International headquarters in Evanston, Illinois,[30][31] and was the coordinator of the Center for Nursing Research at Northern Illinois University.[32]\n\n\nDuckworth was working toward a Ph.D. in political science at Northern Illinois University, with research interests in the political economy and public health of southeast Asia, when she was deployed to Iraq in 2004.[30] She lost her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee[33] from injuries sustained on November 12, 2004, when the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter she was co-piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents.[34] She was the first American female double amputee from the Iraq War.[3] The explosion severely broke her right arm and tore tissue from it, necessitating major surgery to repair it. Duckworth received a Purple Heart[34] on December 3 and was promoted to the rank of major on December 21 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,[35] where she was presented with an Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal.[34] She retired from the Illinois Army National Guard in October 2014 as a lieutenant colonel.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duckworth with Senators Barack Obama and Daniel Akaka in 2005 at a Veterans Affairs hearing\nIn 2011 the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a statue with Duckworth's likeness and that of Molly Pitcher in Mount Vernon, Illinois. The statue is dedicated to female veterans.[37]\n\n\nIn 2019, Duckworth participated in the National Air and Space Museum's \"The Military Women Aviators Oral History Initiative (MWAOHI)\" project alongside fourteen other veteran women aviators, including Olga Custodio, Sarah Deal, Stayce Harris, Jeannie Leavitt, Nicole Malachowski, Sally Murply, Tammie Shults, Jacqueline Van Ovost, Lucy Young, and Kim \"K. C.\" Campbell.[38]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duckworth being sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, by Judge John J. Farley with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey beside her\nOn November 21, 2006, several weeks after losing her first congressional campaign, Duckworth was appointed director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs by Governor Rod Blagojevich.[39][40] She served in that position until February 8, 2009. While director, she was credited with starting a program to help veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and veterans with brain injuries.[41]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Duckworth attended a campaign event for Dan Seals, the Democratic candidate for Illinois's 10th congressional district. She used vacation time, but violated Illinois law by going to the event in a state-owned van that was equipped for a person with physical disabilities. She acknowledged the mistake and repaid the state for the use of the van.[42]\n\n\nIn 2009, two Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs employees at the Anna Veterans' Home in Union County filed a lawsuit against Duckworth.[43] The lawsuit alleged that she wrongfully terminated one employee and threatened and intimidated another for bringing reports of abuse and misconduct of veterans when she was head of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs.[44] Duckworth was represented in the suit by the Illinois Attorney General's office.[45] The case was dismissed twice but refilings were allowed.[46][47] The case settled in June 2016 for $26,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.[46] The plaintiffs later indicated they no longer wanted to settle, but the judge gave them 21 days to sign the settlement and canceled the trial.[48][49]\n\n\nOn February 3, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Duckworth to be the Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).[50] and the United States Senate confirmed her for the position on April 22.[51] As Assistant Secretary, she coordinated a joint initiative with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help end Veteran homelessness, worked to address the unique challenges faced by female as well as Native American Veterans, and created the Office of Online Communications to improve the VA's accessibility, especially among young Veterans.[52] Duckworth resigned her position in June 2011 in order to launch her campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois's 8th congressional district.[53]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 Illinois's 6th congressional district election\n\nAfter longtime incumbent Republican Henry Hyde announced his retirement from Congress, several candidates began campaigning for the open seat. Duckworth won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 44%, defeating 2004 nominee Christine Cegelis with 40%, and Wheaton College professor Lindy Scott with 16%. State Senator Peter Roskam was unopposed in the Republican primary. For the general election, Duckworth was endorsed by EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports female Democratic candidates who back abortion rights.[54] She was also endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Fraternal Order of Police.[55][56] While she raised $4.5 million to Roskam's $3.44 million, Duckworth lost by 4,810 votes, receiving 49% to Roskam's 51%.[57]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois § District 8\n\n![](image)Duckworth as a U.S. representative during the 113th congress\nIn July 2011, Duckworth launched her campaign to run in 2012 for Illinois's 8th congressional district. She defeated former Deputy Treasurer of Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi for the Democratic nomination on March 20, 2012, then faced incumbent Republican Joe Walsh in the general election.[58] Duckworth received the endorsement of both the *Chicago Tribune* and the *Daily Herald*.[59][60] Walsh generated controversy when in July 2012, at a campaign event, he accused Duckworth of politicizing her military service and injuries, saying \"my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, the men and women who served us, it's the last thing in the world they talk about.\" Walsh called the controversy over his comments \"a political ploy to distort my words and distract voters\" and said that \"Of course Tammy Duckworth is a hero ... I have called her a hero hundreds of times.\"[61]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Duckworth defeated Walsh 55%–45%,[62] making her the first Asian-American from Illinois in Congress,[63] the first woman with a disability elected to Congress,[64] and the first member of Congress born in Thailand.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois § District 8\n\nIn the 2014 general election, Duckworth faced Republican nominee Larry Kaifesh, a United States Marine Corps officer who had recently left active duty as a colonel.[66] She defeated him with 56% of the vote.[67]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth was sworn into office on January 3, 2013.[68]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2013, Duckworth publicly returned 8.4% ($1,218) of her congressional salary for that month to the United States Department of Treasury in solidarity with furloughed government workers.[69]\n\n\nOn June 26, 2013, during a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Duckworth received national media attention after questioning Strong Castle CEO Braulio Castillo on a $500 million government contract the company had been awarded based on Castillo's disabled veteran status.[70][71] Castillo had injured his ankle at the US Military Academy's prep school, USMAPS, in 1984.[72]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces (2013–2017)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (2013–2015)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness (2015–2017)\n* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Health Care and Entitlements (2013–2015)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Job Creation and Regulatory Affairs (2013–2015)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets, Ranking Member (2015–2017)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Information Technology (2015–2017)\n* United States House Select Committee on Benghazi (May 2014–July 2016)\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in Illinois\n\nOn March 30, 2015, Duckworth announced that she would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Mark Kirk in the 2016 Senate election in Illinois.[73] She defeated Andrea Zopp and Napoleon Harris in the March 15, 2016, Democratic primary.[74]\n\n\nDuring a televised debate on October 27, 2016, Duckworth talked about her ancestors' past service in the U.S. military. Kirk responded, \"I'd forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\" This led the Human Rights Campaign to rescind its endorsement of Kirk and switch it to Duckworth, calling Kirk's comment \"deeply offensive and racist.\"[75][76]\n\n\nDuckworth was endorsed by Barack Obama, who actively campaigned for her.[77]\n\n\nOn November 8, Duckworth defeated Kirk, 55% to 40%.[78] She and Kamala Harris, who was also elected in 2016, are the second and third female Asian American senators, after Mazie Hirono, who was elected in 2012.[4]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Illinois\n\nIn March 2021, Duckworth announced her candidacy for reelection in 2022.[79] On November 8, 2022, she was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Kathy Salvi.[80] The win made Duckworth the first woman reelected to the Senate from Illinois.[81]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate Diversity Initiative in support of diversity in the Senate and its staff, June 21, 2017\n#### First term (2017–2023)[edit]\n\n\nAccording to The Center for Effective Lawmaking (CEL), a joint partnership between the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy and Vanderbilt University,[82] Duckworth's \"Legislative Effectiveness Score\" (LES) is \"Exceeds Expectations\" as a freshman senator in the 115th Congress (2017–18), the 11th highest out of 48 Democratic senators.[83]\n\n\nGovTrack's Report Card on Duckworth for the 115th Congress found that among Senate freshmen, she ranked first in favorably reporting bills out of committee and \"Got influential cosponsors the most often compared to Senate freshmen.\"[84] GovTrack also found that in the first session of the 116th Congress, Duckworth ranked first in favorably reporting bills out of committee and \"Got influential cosponsors the most often compared to Senate sophomores.\"[85]\n\n\nDuring the 115th Congress, Duckworth was credited with saving the Americans with Disabilities Act.[86] Specifically, she led public opposition to a controversial bill, H.R. 620,[87] and led 42 senators in pledging to oppose any effort to pass H.R. 620 through the Senate.[88] The Veterans Service Organization and Paralyzed Veterans of America recognized Duckworth's leadership in defending the Americans with Disabilities Act.[89]\n\n\n\nIn January 2018, when the federal government shut down after the Senate could not agree on a funding bill, Duckworth responded to President Trump's accusations that the Democrats were putting \"unlawful immigrants\" ahead of the military: \n\n\n> I spent my entire adult life looking out for the well-being, the training, the equipping of the troops for whom I was responsible. Sadly, this is something that the current occupant of the Oval Office does not seem to care to do—and I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger. And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong Un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops, and millions of innocent civilians, in danger.[90]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Stop Kavanaugh press conference on September 6, 2018\nIn 2018, Duckworth became the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office.[91] Shortly afterward, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 463, which she introduced on April 12, 2018,[92] by unanimous consent. The resolution changed Senate rules so that a senator may bring a child under one year old to the Senate floor during votes.[93] The day after the rules were changed, Duckworth's daughter became the first baby on the Senate floor.[92][94]\n\n\nOn April 15, 2020, the Trump administration invited Duckworth to join a bipartisan task force on the reopening of the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[95]\n\n\nDuckworth was publicly critical of Trump's decision to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in September 2020. A devout Catholic, Barrett is a member of a group that considers in vitro fertilization immoral. Duckworth said that Barrett's membership in such an organization was \"disqualifying and, frankly, insulting to every parent\". Both of Duckworth's children were conceived by IVF.[96]\n\n\nThe Center for Effective Lawmaking, a joint initiative of the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University, ranked Duckworth the fifth-most effective Democratic senator in the 116th Congress and the most effective Democratic senator on transportation policy.[97] Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman, co-directors of the Center for Effective Lawmaking, said, \"While still in her first term, Senator Tammy Duckworth has risen to the top five among effective Democratic lawmakers in the Senate. She sponsored 77 bills in the 116th Congress, with four of them passing the Republican-controlled Senate and two becoming law.\"[98]\n\n\nOn January 3, 2021, Duckworth received a vote for Speaker of the House of Representatives from Jared Golden despite not being a member of that legislative body and therefore not a serious candidate.[99]\n\n\nDuckworth was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In the wake of the attack, she called Trump \"a threat to our nation\" and called for his immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment.[100] Two days later, on January 8, she also called for the resignation of Representative Mary Miller, who had quoted Adolf Hitler during a speech on January 5.[101]\n\n\nIn June 2022, President Biden sent Duckworth to Taiwan, where she held a press conference with Tsai Ing-wen to announce the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade in the wake of fears of angering China by the other partners to the May 2022 Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.[102][103] Her mission was planned in conjunction with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which leads the Initiative for Washington.[103]\n\n\nDuckworth is the sponsor of S. 3635, the Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022, which would provide line of duty death designation to law enforcement and other public safety officers who die as a result of traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and other \"silent\" injuries.[104] The bill is based on the death of Washington, D.C. police officer Jeffrey Smith in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Smith died of post-concussive syndrome after suffering repeated attacks at the Capitol.[105][106]\n\n\n\n#### Second term (2023–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Duckworth was named chair of the Subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations and Innovation of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.[107] She and Deb Fischer sponsored a bill to improve reporting on complaints from disabled airline passengers.[108] In June 2023, Duckworth criticized Senator Kyrsten Sinema for proposing legislation to limit the amount of time an airplane pilot needs to train for certification. There is a 1,500-hour training requirement by law. There is a pilot shortage.[109]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### Current[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services (2019–present)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support\n\t+ Subcommittee on Strategic Forces\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security\n* Committee on Foreign Relations (2023–present)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Multilateral International Development, Multilateral Institutions, and International Economic, Energy and Environmental Policy (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation\n\t+ Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n\n\n#### Previous[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (2017–2019)\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works (2017-2023)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[110]\n* Expand Social Security Caucus\n* Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus[111]\n\n\n## National politics[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth spoke at the 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 Democratic National Conventions.[112][113][114] She was the permanent co-chair of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[115] At the 2020 convention, she called Trump \"coward-in-chief\" for not supporting the American military.[116][117]\n\n\nDuckworth was vetted as a possible running mate during Joe Biden's vice presidential candidate selection.[118] Kamala Harris was selected instead. Biden nominated Duckworth as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, along with Gretchen Whitmer, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Filemon Vela Jr.[119]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Duckworth was one of 12 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development advocating that the Energy Department be granted maximum funding for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), arguing that American job growth could be stimulated by investment in viable options to capture carbon emissions and expressing disagreement with Trump's 2020 budget request to combine the two federal programs that include carbon capture research.[120]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duckworth narrates the *Salute to Fallen Asian Pacific Islander Heroes* in Arlington, Virginia, June 2, 2005.\nDuring her unsuccessful 2006 congressional campaign, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001.[121]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2006, Duckworth gave the Democratic Party's response to President George W. Bush's weekly radio address. In it, she criticized Bush's Iraq War strategy.[122]\n\n\nIn October 2006, *The Sunday Times* reported that Duckworth agreed with General Sir Richard Dannatt, the British Army chief, that the presence of coalition troops was exacerbating the conflict in Iraq.[123]\n\n\nDuckworth supports continued U.S. military aid to Israel and opposes the movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel. She opposes Israel's plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.[124]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Duckworth was a cosponsor of the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act,[125] a bipartisan bill reintroduced by Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin that was intended to disrupt China's consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the sea and air space in disputed zones in the South China Sea.[126]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2021, Duckworth and Senators Dan Sullivan and Christopher Coons visited Taipei in an U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport to meet President Tsai Ing-wen and Minister Joseph Wu during the pandemic outbreak of Taiwan to announce President Biden's donation plan of 750,000 COVID-19 vaccines included in the global COVAX program.[127][128]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth was rated by the National Rifle Association of America as having a pro-gun control congressional voting record.[129] A gun owner herself, she cites violence in Chicago as a major influence for her support of gun control. She supports universal background checks, the halting of state-to-state gun trafficking,[130] and a national assault weapons ban.[131]\n\n\nDuckworth participated in the 2016 Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. During the 2016 United States House of Representatives sit-in, she hid her mobile phone in her prosthetic leg to prevent it being taken away from her since taking pictures and recording on the House floor is against policy.[130]\n\n\nIn a 2016 interview with *GQ* magazine, Duckworth said that gaining control of the Senate and \"closing the gap\" in the House would be necessary to pass firearm restrictions. She also said she believed that moderate Republicans, who support gun control, would have more power if they were not \"pushed aside by those folks who are absolutely beholden to the NRA. And so we never get the vote.\"[130]\n\n\n\n### Health policy[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth supports abortion rights.[132][133] After *Roe v. Wade* was overturned in 2022, she said she was \"outraged and horrified\" and called the decision a \"nightmare\" that robbed women of their right to make health care decisions.[134]\n\n\nDuckworth supported the Affordable Care Act.[135]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth supports comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for those in the country illegally. She would admit 100,000 Syrian refugees into the United States.[135]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Duckworth was one of 17 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Kamala Harris to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\"[136]\n\n\n\n## Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2010, Northern Illinois University awarded Duckworth the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.[137][138] In 2011, Chicago's Access Living honored her for her work on behalf of veterans with disabilities, giving her the Gordon H. Mansfield Congressional Leadership Award.[139]\n\n\nDuckworth is heavily decorated for her service in Iraq, with over 10 distinct military honors, most notably the Purple Heart, an award her Marine father had also received.[34] In 2010, she was inducted into the Army Women's hall of fame.[140]\n\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate and U.S. senator Bob Dole dedicated his autobiography *One Soldier's Story* in part to Duckworth.[141] Duckworth credits Dole for inspiring her to pursue public service, while she recuperated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[142]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth has been married to Bryan Bowlsbey since 1993.[143] They met during Duckworth's participation in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and served together in the Illinois Army National Guard.[143] A Signal Corps officer, Bowlsbey is also a veteran of the Iraq War.[143][144] Both have since retired from the armed forces.[145]\n\n\nDuckworth and Bowlsbey have two daughters: Abigail, born in 2014,[146] and Maile, born in 2018.[147] Maile's birth made Duckworth the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office.[147][148] Former Senator Daniel Akaka helped the couple name both girls; Akaka died on April 6, 2018, three days before Maile was born.[149] Shortly after Maile's birth, a Senate rule change permitted senators to bring children under one year old on the Senate floor to breastfeed.[92] This was a symbolic moment for Duckworth, as she had previously introduced the bipartisan Friendly Airports for Mothers (FAM) Act to ensure new mothers access to safe, clean and accessible lactation rooms in airports.[52] The day after the rule change, Duckworth brought Maile with her during the casting of a Senate vote, making Duckworth the first senator to cast a vote while holding a baby.[92][94]\n\n\nDuckworth helped establish the Intrepid Foundation to help injured veterans.[150]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nIllinois 6th Congressional District Democratic Primary, 2006[151]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **L.

Research suggests that performance in a lawmaker's freshman term is highly correlated with subsequent lawmaking effectiveness, as well as with their overall career trajectory.  \n  \n Among them are two Senators (out of the eleven Senators in their freshman class), John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Kennedy sponsored 26 bills, including four that passed the Senate and eventually became law, on issues ranging from national flood insurance and small business disaster loans to mandatory disclosure of corrupt practices among lobbyists. Duckworth shepherded three of her 45 proposed bills into law, including the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act of 2018.\n84. **^** \"Sen. Tammy Duckworth's 2018 Report Card\". GovTrack.

A member of the Democratic Party, she represented Illinois's 8th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2013 to 2017.\n\n\nBorn in Bangkok, Thailand and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Duckworth was educated at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and George Washington University in Washington, D.C. A combat veteran of the Iraq War, she served as a U.S. Army helicopter pilot. In 2004, when her Black Hawk helicopter was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents, she lost both legs and some mobility in her right arm. She was the first female double amputee from the war.[3] Despite her injuries, she was awarded a medical waiver to continue serving in the Illinois Army National Guard for another ten years until she retired as a lieutenant colonel in 2014.\n\n\nDuckworth ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2006, then served as director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs from 2006 to 2009 and as assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs at the United States Department of Veterans Affairs from 2009 to 2011. In 2012, Duckworth was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she served two terms. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016, defeating Republican incumbent Mark Kirk.[4]\n\n\nDuckworth is the first Thai American woman elected to Congress, the first person born in Thailand elected to Congress, the first woman with a disability elected to Congress, the first female double amputee in the Senate, and the first senator to give birth while in office. Duckworth is the second of three Asian American women to serve in the U.S. Senate, after Mazie Hirono, and before Kamala Harris.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth was born in Bangkok, Thailand, the daughter of Franklin Duckworth and his wife Lamai Sompornpairin.[6] Her father, who died in 2005,[7] was a veteran of the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps[8] who traced his family's roots to the American Revolutionary War.[9] Duckworth is also descended from Henry Coe, her 6th-great grandfather, who owned four slaves and bequeathed them their freedom at set ages (one at 40 and three at 36) in his 1827 will; according to Duckworth, although \"gut wrenching\" . . . \"it's a disservice to our nation and our history to walk away from this [fact]. If I am going to claim—and be proud that—I am a Daughter of the American Revolution, then I have to acknowledge that I am also a daughter of people who enslaved other people\".[10] Her mother is Thai Chinese[11] and originally from Chiang Mai.[12] Her father was a Baptist,[13] who after his military service worked with the United Nations and international companies in refugee, housing, and development programs.[14] As the family moved around Southeast Asia for her father's work, Duckworth became fluent in Thai and Indonesian, in addition to English.[15]\n\n\nDuckworth attended American curriculum based schools: Singapore American School, the International School Bangkok, and the Jakarta International School.[16][17] The family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, when Duckworth was 16, and she attended Honolulu's McKinley High School, where she participated in track and field and graduated in 1985.[18] Because of a difference in the grade levels between the school systems she attended, Duckworth skipped half of her ninth grade year and half of her tenth.[19] She was a Girl Scout, and earned her First Class, now called the Gold Award.[20] Her father was unemployed for a time, and the family relied on public assistance.[14] She graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science. In 1992, she received a Master of Arts in international affairs from George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs.[21][22]\n\n\nLater, Duckworth began a PhD program at Northern Illinois University, with interests in public health and the politics of southeast Asia, which was interrupted by her war service.[23] She completed a PhD in human services at Capella University School of Public Service Leadership in March 2015.[24][25] Her dissertation was titled *Exploring Illinois physicians' experience using electronic medical records (EMR) via the UTAUT model*.[25] Julia Moore was her faculty mentor.[25]\n\n\n\n## Military service[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Captain Duckworth in 2000\nFollowing in the footsteps of her father, who served in World War II and the Vietnam War,[8] and ancestors who served in every major conflict since the Revolutionary War,[9] Duckworth joined the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps[26] in 1990 as a graduate student at George Washington University.[27][28] She became a commissioned officer in the United States Army Reserve in 1992 and chose to fly helicopters[26] because it was one of the few combat jobs open to women at that time.[29] As a member of the Army Reserve, she went to flight school, later transferring to the Army National Guard and in 1996 entering the Illinois Army National Guard.[26] Duckworth also worked as a staff supervisor at Rotary International headquarters in Evanston, Illinois,[30][31] and was the coordinator of the Center for Nursing Research at Northern Illinois University.[32]\n\n\nDuckworth was working toward a Ph.D. in political science at Northern Illinois University, with research interests in the political economy and public health of southeast Asia, when she was deployed to Iraq in 2004.[30] She lost her right leg near the hip and her left leg below the knee[33] from injuries sustained on November 12, 2004, when the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter she was co-piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by Iraqi insurgents.[34] She was the first American female double amputee from the Iraq War.[3] The explosion severely broke her right arm and tore tissue from it, necessitating major surgery to repair it. Duckworth received a Purple Heart[34] on December 3 and was promoted to the rank of major on December 21 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center,[35] where she was presented with an Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal.[34] She retired from the Illinois Army National Guard in October 2014 as a lieutenant colonel.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duckworth with Senators Barack Obama and Daniel Akaka in 2005 at a Veterans Affairs hearing\nIn 2011 the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a statue with Duckworth's likeness and that of Molly Pitcher in Mount Vernon, Illinois. The statue is dedicated to female veterans.[37]\n\n\nIn 2019, Duckworth participated in the National Air and Space Museum's \"The Military Women Aviators Oral History Initiative (MWAOHI)\" project alongside fourteen other veteran women aviators, including Olga Custodio, Sarah Deal, Stayce Harris, Jeannie Leavitt, Nicole Malachowski, Sally Murply, Tammie Shults, Jacqueline Van Ovost, Lucy Young, and Kim \"K. C.\" Campbell.[38]\n\n\n\n## Government service[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duckworth being sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, by Judge John J. Farley with her husband Bryan Bowlsbey beside her\nOn November 21, 2006, several weeks after losing her first congressional campaign, Duckworth was appointed director of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs by Governor Rod Blagojevich.[39][40] She served in that position until February 8, 2009. While director, she was credited with starting a program to help veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and veterans with brain injuries.[41]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Duckworth attended a campaign event for Dan Seals, the Democratic candidate for Illinois's 10th congressional district. She used vacation time, but violated Illinois law by going to the event in a state-owned van that was equipped for a person with physical disabilities. She acknowledged the mistake and repaid the state for the use of the van.[42]\n\n\nIn 2009, two Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs employees at the Anna Veterans' Home in Union County filed a lawsuit against Duckworth.[43] The lawsuit alleged that she wrongfully terminated one employee and threatened and intimidated another for bringing reports of abuse and misconduct of veterans when she was head of the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs.[44] Duckworth was represented in the suit by the Illinois Attorney General's office.[45] The case was dismissed twice but refilings were allowed.[46][47] The case settled in June 2016 for $26,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.[46] The plaintiffs later indicated they no longer wanted to settle, but the judge gave them 21 days to sign the settlement and canceled the trial.[48][49]\n\n\nOn February 3, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Duckworth to be the Assistant Secretary of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).[50] and the United States Senate confirmed her for the position on April 22.[51] As Assistant Secretary, she coordinated a joint initiative with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help end Veteran homelessness, worked to address the unique challenges faced by female as well as Native American Veterans, and created the Office of Online Communications to improve the VA's accessibility, especially among young Veterans.[52] Duckworth resigned her position in June 2011 in order to launch her campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in Illinois's 8th congressional district.[53]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 Illinois's 6th congressional district election\n\nAfter longtime incumbent Republican Henry Hyde announced his retirement from Congress, several candidates began campaigning for the open seat. Duckworth won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 44%, defeating 2004 nominee Christine Cegelis with 40%, and Wheaton College professor Lindy Scott with 16%. State Senator Peter Roskam was unopposed in the Republican primary. For the general election, Duckworth was endorsed by EMILY's List, a political action committee that supports female Democratic candidates who back abortion rights.[54] She was also endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Fraternal Order of Police.[55][56] While she raised $4.5 million to Roskam's $3.44 million, Duckworth lost by 4,810 votes, receiving 49% to Roskam's 51%.[57]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois § District 8\n\n![](image)Duckworth as a U.S. representative during the 113th congress\nIn July 2011, Duckworth launched her campaign to run in 2012 for Illinois's 8th congressional district. She defeated former Deputy Treasurer of Illinois Raja Krishnamoorthi for the Democratic nomination on March 20, 2012, then faced incumbent Republican Joe Walsh in the general election.[58] Duckworth received the endorsement of both the *Chicago Tribune* and the *Daily Herald*.[59][60] Walsh generated controversy when in July 2012, at a campaign event, he accused Duckworth of politicizing her military service and injuries, saying \"my God, that's all she talks about. Our true heroes, the men and women who served us, it's the last thing in the world they talk about.\" Walsh called the controversy over his comments \"a political ploy to distort my words and distract voters\" and said that \"Of course Tammy Duckworth is a hero ... I have called her a hero hundreds of times.\"[61]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Duckworth defeated Walsh 55%–45%,[62] making her the first Asian-American from Illinois in Congress,[63] the first woman with a disability elected to Congress,[64] and the first member of Congress born in Thailand.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois § District 8\n\nIn the 2014 general election, Duckworth faced Republican nominee Larry Kaifesh, a United States Marine Corps officer who had recently left active duty as a colonel.[66] She defeated him with 56% of the vote.[67]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth was sworn into office on January 3, 2013.[68]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2013, Duckworth publicly returned 8.4% ($1,218) of her congressional salary for that month to the United States Department of Treasury in solidarity with furloughed government workers.[69]\n\n\nOn June 26, 2013, during a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Duckworth received national media attention after questioning Strong Castle CEO Braulio Castillo on a $500 million government contract the company had been awarded based on Castillo's disabled veteran status.[70][71] Castillo had injured his ankle at the US Military Academy's prep school, USMAPS, in 1984.[72]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces (2013–2017)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations (2013–2015)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness (2015–2017)\n* Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Health Care and Entitlements (2013–2015)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Job Creation and Regulatory Affairs (2013–2015)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Assets, Ranking Member (2015–2017)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Information Technology (2015–2017)\n* United States House Select Committee on Benghazi (May 2014–July 2016)\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in Illinois\n\nOn March 30, 2015, Duckworth announced that she would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Mark Kirk in the 2016 Senate election in Illinois.[73] She defeated Andrea Zopp and Napoleon Harris in the March 15, 2016, Democratic primary.[74]\n\n\nDuring a televised debate on October 27, 2016, Duckworth talked about her ancestors' past service in the U.S. military. Kirk responded, \"I'd forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington.\" This led the Human Rights Campaign to rescind its endorsement of Kirk and switch it to Duckworth, calling Kirk's comment \"deeply offensive and racist.\"[75][76]\n\n\nDuckworth was endorsed by Barack Obama, who actively campaigned for her.[77]\n\n\nOn November 8, Duckworth defeated Kirk, 55% to 40%.[78] She and Kamala Harris, who was also elected in 2016, are the second and third female Asian American senators, after Mazie Hirono, who was elected in 2012.[4]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Illinois\n\nIn March 2021, Duckworth announced her candidacy for reelection in 2022.[79] On November 8, 2022, she was reelected, defeating Republican nominee Kathy Salvi.[80] The win made Duckworth the first woman reelected to the Senate from Illinois.[81]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate Diversity Initiative in support of diversity in the Senate and its staff, June 21, 2017\n#### First term (2017–2023)[edit]\n\n\nAccording to The Center for Effective Lawmaking (CEL), a joint partnership between the University of Virginia's Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy and Vanderbilt University,[82] Duckworth's \"Legislative Effectiveness Score\" (LES) is \"Exceeds Expectations\" as a freshman senator in the 115th Congress (2017–18), the 11th highest out of 48 Democratic senators.[83]\n\n\nGovTrack's Report Card on Duckworth for the 115th Congress found that among Senate freshmen, she ranked first in favorably reporting bills out of committee and \"Got influential cosponsors the most often compared to Senate freshmen.\"[84] GovTrack also found that in the first session of the 116th Congress, Duckworth ranked first in favorably reporting bills out of committee and \"Got influential cosponsors the most often compared to Senate sophomores.\"[85]\n\n\nDuring the 115th Congress, Duckworth was credited with saving the Americans with Disabilities Act.[86] Specifically, she led public opposition to a controversial bill, H.R. 620,[87] and led 42 senators in pledging to oppose any effort to pass H.R. 620 through the Senate.[88] The Veterans Service Organization and Paralyzed Veterans of America recognized Duckworth's leadership in defending the Americans with Disabilities Act.[89]\n\n\n\nIn January 2018, when the federal government shut down after the Senate could not agree on a funding bill, Duckworth responded to President Trump's accusations that the Democrats were putting \"unlawful immigrants\" ahead of the military: \n\n\n> I spent my entire adult life looking out for the well-being, the training, the equipping of the troops for whom I was responsible. Sadly, this is something that the current occupant of the Oval Office does not seem to care to do—and I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger. And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong Un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops, and millions of innocent civilians, in danger.[90]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Stop Kavanaugh press conference on September 6, 2018\nIn 2018, Duckworth became the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office.[91] Shortly afterward, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 463, which she introduced on April 12, 2018,[92] by unanimous consent. The resolution changed Senate rules so that a senator may bring a child under one year old to the Senate floor during votes.[93] The day after the rules were changed, Duckworth's daughter became the first baby on the Senate floor.[92][94]\n\n\nOn April 15, 2020, the Trump administration invited Duckworth to join a bipartisan task force on the reopening of the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic.[95]\n\n\nDuckworth was publicly critical of Trump's decision to nominate Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in September 2020. A devout Catholic, Barrett is a member of a group that considers in vitro fertilization immoral. Duckworth said that Barrett's membership in such an organization was \"disqualifying and, frankly, insulting to every parent\". Both of Duckworth's children were conceived by IVF.[96]\n\n\nThe Center for Effective Lawmaking, a joint initiative of the University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University, ranked Duckworth the fifth-most effective Democratic senator in the 116th Congress and the most effective Democratic senator on transportation policy.[97] Craig Volden and Alan Wiseman, co-directors of the Center for Effective Lawmaking, said, \"While still in her first term, Senator Tammy Duckworth has risen to the top five among effective Democratic lawmakers in the Senate. She sponsored 77 bills in the 116th Congress, with four of them passing the Republican-controlled Senate and two becoming law.\"[98]\n\n\nOn January 3, 2021, Duckworth received a vote for Speaker of the House of Representatives from Jared Golden despite not being a member of that legislative body and therefore not a serious candidate.[99]\n\n\nDuckworth was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. In the wake of the attack, she called Trump \"a threat to our nation\" and called for his immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment.[100] Two days later, on January 8, she also called for the resignation of Representative Mary Miller, who had quoted Adolf Hitler during a speech on January 5.[101]\n\n\nIn June 2022, President Biden sent Duckworth to Taiwan, where she held a press conference with Tsai Ing-wen to announce the U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade in the wake of fears of angering China by the other partners to the May 2022 Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.[102][103] Her mission was planned in conjunction with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which leads the Initiative for Washington.[103]\n\n\nDuckworth is the sponsor of S. 3635, the Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022, which would provide line of duty death designation to law enforcement and other public safety officers who die as a result of traumatic brain injury, PTSD, and other \"silent\" injuries.[104] The bill is based on the death of Washington, D.C. police officer Jeffrey Smith in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Smith died of post-concussive syndrome after suffering repeated attacks at the Capitol.[105][106]\n\n\n\n#### Second term (2023–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Duckworth was named chair of the Subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations and Innovation of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.[107] She and Deb Fischer sponsored a bill to improve reporting on complaints from disabled airline passengers.[108] In June 2023, Duckworth criticized Senator Kyrsten Sinema for proposing legislation to limit the amount of time an airplane pilot needs to train for certification. There is a 1,500-hour training requirement by law. There is a pilot shortage.[109]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### Current[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services (2019–present)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support\n\t+ Subcommittee on Strategic Forces\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance and Data Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security\n* Committee on Foreign Relations (2023–present)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Multilateral International Development, Multilateral Institutions, and International Economic, Energy and Environmental Policy (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Europe and Regional Security Cooperation\n\t+ Subcommittee on East Asia, The Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Policy\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n\n\n#### Previous[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (2017–2019)\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works (2017-2023)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[110]\n* Expand Social Security Caucus\n* Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus[111]\n\n\n## National politics[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth spoke at the 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020 Democratic National Conventions.[112][113][114] She was the permanent co-chair of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[115] At the 2020 convention, she called Trump \"coward-in-chief\" for not supporting the American military.[116][117]\n\n\nDuckworth was vetted as a possible running mate during Joe Biden's vice presidential candidate selection.[118] Kamala Harris was selected instead. Biden nominated Duckworth as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, along with Gretchen Whitmer, Keisha Lance Bottoms and Filemon Vela Jr.[119]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Duckworth was one of 12 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to top senators on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development advocating that the Energy Department be granted maximum funding for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), arguing that American job growth could be stimulated by investment in viable options to capture carbon emissions and expressing disagreement with Trump's 2020 budget request to combine the two federal programs that include carbon capture research.[120]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duckworth narrates the *Salute to Fallen Asian Pacific Islander Heroes* in Arlington, Virginia, June 2, 2005.\nDuring her unsuccessful 2006 congressional campaign, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001.[121]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2006, Duckworth gave the Democratic Party's response to President George W. Bush's weekly radio address. In it, she criticized Bush's Iraq War strategy.[122]\n\n\nIn October 2006, *The Sunday Times* reported that Duckworth agreed with General Sir Richard Dannatt, the British Army chief, that the presence of coalition troops was exacerbating the conflict in Iraq.[123]\n\n\nDuckworth supports continued U.S. military aid to Israel and opposes the movement for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel. She opposes Israel's plan to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.[124]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Duckworth was a cosponsor of the South China Sea and East China Sea Sanctions Act,[125] a bipartisan bill reintroduced by Marco Rubio and Ben Cardin that was intended to disrupt China's consolidation or expansion of its claims of jurisdiction over both the sea and air space in disputed zones in the South China Sea.[126]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2021, Duckworth and Senators Dan Sullivan and Christopher Coons visited Taipei in an U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III transport to meet President Tsai Ing-wen and Minister Joseph Wu during the pandemic outbreak of Taiwan to announce President Biden's donation plan of 750,000 COVID-19 vaccines included in the global COVAX program.[127][128]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth was rated by the National Rifle Association of America as having a pro-gun control congressional voting record.[129] A gun owner herself, she cites violence in Chicago as a major influence for her support of gun control. She supports universal background checks, the halting of state-to-state gun trafficking,[130] and a national assault weapons ban.[131]\n\n\nDuckworth participated in the 2016 Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. During the 2016 United States House of Representatives sit-in, she hid her mobile phone in her prosthetic leg to prevent it being taken away from her since taking pictures and recording on the House floor is against policy.[130]\n\n\nIn a 2016 interview with *GQ* magazine, Duckworth said that gaining control of the Senate and \"closing the gap\" in the House would be necessary to pass firearm restrictions. She also said she believed that moderate Republicans, who support gun control, would have more power if they were not \"pushed aside by those folks who are absolutely beholden to the NRA. And so we never get the vote.\"[130]\n\n\n\n### Health policy[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth supports abortion rights.[132][133] After *Roe v. Wade* was overturned in 2022, she said she was \"outraged and horrified\" and called the decision a \"nightmare\" that robbed women of their right to make health care decisions.[134]\n\n\nDuckworth supported the Affordable Care Act.[135]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth supports comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for those in the country illegally. She would admit 100,000 Syrian refugees into the United States.[135]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Duckworth was one of 17 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Kamala Harris to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\"[136]\n\n\n\n## Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2010, Northern Illinois University awarded Duckworth the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.[137][138] In 2011, Chicago's Access Living honored her for her work on behalf of veterans with disabilities, giving her the Gordon H. Mansfield Congressional Leadership Award.[139]\n\n\nDuckworth is heavily decorated for her service in Iraq, with over 10 distinct military honors, most notably the Purple Heart, an award her Marine father had also received.[34] In 2010, she was inducted into the Army Women's hall of fame.[140]\n\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate and U.S. senator Bob Dole dedicated his autobiography *One Soldier's Story* in part to Duckworth.[141] Duckworth credits Dole for inspiring her to pursue public service, while she recuperated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[142]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDuckworth has been married to Bryan Bowlsbey since 1993.[143] They met during Duckworth's participation in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and served together in the Illinois Army National Guard.[143] A Signal Corps officer, Bowlsbey is also a veteran of the Iraq War.[143][144] Both have since retired from the armed forces.[145]\n\n\nDuckworth and Bowlsbey have two daughters: Abigail, born in 2014,[146] and Maile, born in 2018.[147] Maile's birth made Duckworth the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office.[147][148] Former Senator Daniel Akaka helped the couple name both girls; Akaka died on April 6, 2018, three days before Maile was born.[149] Shortly after Maile's birth, a Senate rule change permitted senators to bring children under one year old on the Senate floor to breastfeed.[92] This was a symbolic moment for Duckworth, as she had previously introduced the bipartisan Friendly Airports for Mothers (FAM) Act to ensure new mothers access to safe, clean and accessible lactation rooms in airports.[52] The day after the rule change, Duckworth brought Maile with her during the casting of a Senate vote, making Duckworth the first senator to cast a vote while holding a baby.[92][94]\n\n\nDuckworth helped establish the Intrepid Foundation to help injured veterans.[150]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nIllinois 6th Congressional District Democratic Primary, 2006[151]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **L.

Research suggests that performance in a lawmaker's freshman term is highly correlated with subsequent lawmaking effectiveness, as well as with their overall career trajectory.  \n  \n Among them are two Senators (out of the eleven Senators in their freshman class), John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois. Kennedy sponsored 26 bills, including four that passed the Senate and eventually became law, on issues ranging from national flood insurance and small business disaster loans to mandatory disclosure of corrupt practices among lobbyists. Duckworth shepherded three of her 45 proposed bills into law, including the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act of 2018.\n84. **^** \"Sen. Tammy Duckworth's 2018 Report Card\". GovTrack.

Having been strongly critical of President Barack Obama, she has been characterized as a reliable ally of President Donald Trump, and was thought to be a possible running mate in his 2016 campaign. Ernst was elected vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference in November 2018.[20] She was reelected in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Theresa Greenfield by 6.6 points.[21]\n\n\nErnst opposes legalized abortion, and has supported a fetal personhood amendment and introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. She opposes the Affordable Care Act and has called for reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. During the Trump administration, she expressed concern about, although not opposition to, Trump's trade war with China and criticized some aspects of his foreign policy. Ernst voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While supporting both Trump's nominees for EPA administrator, she expressed concern over their commitment to the Renewable Fuel Standard. She rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. Ernst has opposed a federal minimum wage and advocated for the elimination of federal departments such as the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nErnst was born Joni Kay Culver in Montgomery County, Iowa, the daughter of Marilyn and Richard Culver. She was valedictorian of her class at Stanton Community School District High School.[14] She earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Iowa State University in 1992,[22] and a Master of Public Administration degree from Columbus State University in 1995.[8][14] In college, she took part in an agricultural exchange to the Soviet Union.[23]\n\n\n\n### Military career[edit]\n\n\nErnst joined Iowa State University's ROTC program at age 20 and the United States Army Reserve after graduating.[2] She served as a logistics officer and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard. In 2003–2004, she spent 12 months in Kuwait as commander of the 1168th Transportation Company, during the Iraq War.[8][9][10][11][24] Near the end of her career, she served as the commanding officer of the 185th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Camp Dodge, the Iowa Army National Guard's largest battalion.[12][13] Upon her retirement from the military in 2015, Ernst had served 23 years in the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard.[3] Her awards included the Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.[4]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Time Magazine* in 2014, Ernst said that she was sexually harassed in the military, saying, \"I had comments, passes, things like that\" that she was able to stop, and said she would support removing investigation and prosecution of sexual assault cases from the chain of command.[25]\n\n\n\n### Iowa politics[edit]\n\n\nErnst was elected Montgomery County Auditor in 2004 and reelected in 2008.[8][16] She was elected to the Iowa State Senate in a special election in 2011 and reelected in 2012. She represented District 12, in southwestern Iowa.[9][10][18][19]\n\n\nFollowing her election to the U.S. Senate, Ernst resigned from the Iowa State Senate, effective November 28, 2014.[26]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in Iowa\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference\nIn July 2013, Ernst announced that she would seek the Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Tom Harkin. Iowa Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds endorsed her in October 2013.[27] In March 2014, Ernst was endorsed by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin,[28][29] to whom she has drawn comparisons.[30][31] In May 2014, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group, endorsed her.[32][33][34]\n\n\nLittle known at the start of her campaign, Ernst was boosted in the Republican primary by the Koch brothers with \"hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of television ads [...] and tens of thousands of dollars in direct campaign contributions\".[35][36][37] A Koch-backed group launched an \"advertising blitz\", including a $257,000 campaign against Ernst's biggest Republican rival, Mark Jacobs, who had supported a proposal to limit carbon emissions that Koch Industries opposed.[35] Ernst privately credited the Kochs and their allies for having \"really started my trajectory\" after her primary victory.[35][36]\n\n\nErnst received widespread attention for a campaign advertisement she released in March 2014, in which she made a tongue-in-cheek comparison between her experience castrating pigs and her ability to \"cut pork\" in Congress.[38][39] Many found the ad humorous,[38][40] and it was spoofed by late-night comedians, including Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert.[41][42][43][44] Before the ad aired, Ernst had struggled to raise money,[45][46] and two polls of the Republican primary taken in February 2014 had shown her in second place, several points behind Mark Jacobs.[47][48] After it aired, a Suffolk University poll in early April showed her with a narrow lead and a Loras College poll showed her essentially tied with Jacobs.[43][49][50][51] By May, she was being described in the media as the \"strong front-runner\".[32]\n\n\nDuring the primary, Ernst promoted a conspiracy theory that a United Nations sustainable development plan, Agenda 21, could lead to farmers being forced off their land and made to live in cities, but a few months later she said she did not consider the plan a \"threat\".[52][53]\n\n\nIn a May 2014 *Des Moines Register* interview, Ernst said she was \"extremely offended\" by comments Jacobs made characterizing her as AWOL due to missing over 100 votes in the legislative session.[54] Previously, in *The Gazette*, Ernst cited her National Guard duty to rebuff criticism about her missing votes,[55] but *The Gazette* found that only 12 of the 117 missed votes came on days when she was on duty. The other 105 missed votes represented 57% of the Iowa Senate votes that session. Ernst's spokesman said she had a better than 90% voting record during her Senate career and that she had never claimed Guard service was the only reason she had missed votes.[55][56]\n\n\nIn July, Ernst delivered the Republican Party's weekly address, criticizing a health care scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs and calling for a balanced budget and reform of Social Security and Medicare.[23] Later that month, she suspended her campaign while participating in two weeks of National Guard duty.[57]\n\n\nIn endorsing her for the Republican primary nomination, the *Des Moines Register* wrote: \"Ernst is a smart, well-prepared candidate who can wrestle with the details of public policy from a conservative perspective without seeming inflexible.\"[58] On October 23, Ernst canceled a scheduled meeting with the *Des Moines Register'*s editorial board, citing the paper's negative editorials about her.[59] The editorial board ultimately endorsed Braley, citing Ernst's calls to abolish the EPA, the Department of Education, and the federal minimum wage, as well as her support for partially privatizing Social Security and overturning the Affordable Care Act.[60][61]\n\n\nIn the 2014 election, Ernst received $17,552,085 in \"dark money\", which constituted 74% of non-party outside spending in her support;[62] she had a $14 million outside spending advantage over her opponent.[36] In an October 2014 debate, Ernst said she “believe[s] in political free speech” and did not see a need to change campaign finance laws.[63]\n\n\nErnst won the 2014 Senate race, 52.2% to 43.7%.[64] She is the first woman elected to represent Iowa in either house of Congress.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in Iowa\n\nErnst ran for reelection in 2020. She was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced Democratic nominee Theresa Greenfield, a businesswoman and former congressional candidate, in the general election. Ernst was seen as the strong favorite and eventually defeated her opponent, 52%-45%.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn December 2019, the Associated Press reported that Ernst's campaign had closely coordinated with a political nonprofit founded by a longtime consultant; such groups are tax-exempt and not required to disclose donors, but cannot make political campaigning their primary purpose and must separate their activities from candidates they support.[69] An Ernst campaign adviser said that any implication they had acted outside the \"spirit of the law\" was \"fake news\". After the article's publication, the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking at a campaign event for Marco Rubio in January 2016\nErnst was sworn into the United States Senate on January 3, 2015, and thus became Iowa's first new U.S. senator since Tom Harkin in 1985.[72] She delivered the official Republican response to the State of the Union on January 20.[72][73][74]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Chris Cilizza put Ernst on his short list of possible vice presidential running mates for Donald Trump to become the 45th President of the United States.[75][76] Other media outlets also mentioned her as a possible benefit to Trump's campaign.[77][78][79] On June 16, Ernst said no one had \"reached out\" to her and that she was content with this.[80] On July 4, she and Trump met privately.[81] Trump selected Governor Mike Pence of Indiana on July 15.[82]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ernst and other Republican senators introduced \"Sarah's Law\" in honor of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old student in Omaha who was killed in a street racing crash earlier that year.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ernst's freshman portrait\nIn 2017, Ernst asked Secretary of Defense nominee James Mattis whether he would pledge to cut wasteful spending and stop sexual assault in the military, to which Mattis agreed.[84]\n\n\nIn March, after photographs of nude female soldiers were posted on Facebook, Ernst said that this \"type of activity creates a culture that leads to sexual assault.\"[85] At a press conference two weeks later, she asked Congress to pass a law requiring people to immediately report suspected sexual assault at government facilities.[86]\n\n\nErnst was elected vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference in November 2018.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ernst (at right) at the signing of the INSPIRE Women Act at the White House, 2017\nOn the initiation of the 116th United States Congress in 2019, Ernst became the first female Republican to be appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with Marsha Blackburn.[87]\n\n\nIn March 2019, after the Special Counsel Investigation concluded and Attorney General William Barr released an abridged summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, Ernst called for a release of the report's full findings, saying, \"as much of the report that can be made public should be\".[88]\n\n\nIn August 2020, when Iowa had the most new COVID-19 infections per capita of any state in the preceding seven days, Ernst repeated a debunked conspiracy theory that the case numbers were greatly inflated and that health care providers might be falsifying them.[89] She later walked back her statements.[90]\n\n\nAfter Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death in September 2020, Ernst said she supported Trump nominating a new justice before the November presidential election.[91] Eight months before the 2016 presidential election, Ernst opposed Senate consideration of Obama's Supreme Court nominee, saying \"the American people deserve to have a say\" on a decision that would \"impact the course of our country for years to come\".[92][93] In 2018, Ernst reiterated that Supreme Court nominees should not be heard during presidential election years, telling the *Des Moines Register*, \"It's precedent set. ... So come 2020, if there's an opening, I'm sure you'll remind me of that.\"[94]\n\n\nErnst was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. She called the storming \"a protest turned anarchy\" and, citing that she served in the military to defend the right to peacefully protest, \"a complete betrayal of those sacred ideals.\"[95] When Congress returned to the certification process, Ernst voted to support certification.[96] She opposed impeaching Trump for the attack on the Capitol, choosing to support a peaceful transfer of power and \"healing our nation.\"[97] In response, *The Gazette* editorial board wrote that Ernst and Grassley \"must reckon with why they did the wrong thing for so long\" regarding their support of Trump during his presidency.[96]\n\n\nin a September 2021 Fox News interview, Ernst accused President Joe Biden of overstepping presidential powers and \"leading by coercion\"[98] with the newly announced \"Path Out of the Pandemic\"[99] initiative,[98] aimed at mitigating the rising threat of the COVID-19 Delta variant.[100] \"Forcing these federal mandates was one way to divert us\", she said. \"This is a diversion away from 9/11, away from the 20th anniversary and away from the debacle that was his Afghanistan withdrawal\".[98] The previous week, Biden had signed an executive order declassifying 9/11 documents that the victims' families had requested for many years; his agenda on September 11, 2021, included visits to three 9/11 crash sites in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[100]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Cybersecurity\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (Ranking Member)\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade\n\t+ Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship (Ranking Member)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Republican Main Street Partnership[101]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, *Politico* called Ernst \"a reliable vote for most of Trump's agenda\",[102] and as of October 2020, she had voted in line with Donald Trump's positions 91.1% of the time.[103] The American Conservative Union's Center for Legislative Accountability gives Ernst a lifetime conservative score of 81.69.[104] The politically liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave Ernst a score of zero for 2019.[105]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes legalized abortion.[106] In 2013, she voted for a fetal personhood amendment in the Iowa Senate and has said that she would support a federal personhood bill.[107] Critics, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have expressed concern that such an amendment could restrict abortion even in cases of rape or incest, as well as certain forms of birth control, although Ernst has affirmed that she supports access to birth control.[107][108] In January 2020, she petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider *Roe v. Wade*, the landmark ruling that abortion bans are unconstitutional.[109][110]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ernst introduced legislation allowing states to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X grants or reimbursements for treating Medicaid patients, although Planned Parenthood clinics provide multiple family planning services and the funding does not go to abortions except in rare circumstances.[111][112] Ernst supported the 2022 overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, calling it a science-based decision.[113]\n\n\n\n### Barack Obama[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, when asked about President Barack Obama's recess appointments, Ernst called Obama a \"dictator\" who should be \"removed from office\" or face \"impeachment.\"[114] She said, \"He is running amok. He is not following our Constitution.\"[114][115]\n\n\nLater in 2014, Ernst criticized Obama's handling of the Ebola outbreak.[116]\n\n\n\n### Diabetes and price cap for insulin[edit]\n\n\nErnst voted against capping the price of insulin at $35;[117] she has said that she has two family members who are diabetic.[118]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ernst voted to acquit Trump on both articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress).[119] She argued that Trump had learned his lesson, and that he would not ask a foreign leader to investigate his rivals again without going through the proper channels.[120][121] At the same time, she suggested that Joe Biden could be impeached if he becomes president over his actions in Ukraine; there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden in regard to Ukraine.[122][123]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Ernst praised Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, \"he was right on it from day one\".[124]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Ernst voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[125]\n\n\n\n### Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes a federal minimum wage and has said that states should have sole authority to set their minimum wages.[126][127][128] She voted against a minimum wage increase in the state Senate.[128] In response to a Congressional Budget Office report projecting that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but cost 500,000 people their jobs, Ernst said, \"government-mandated wage increases are not the solution.\"[129]\n\n\nErnst has proposed eliminating the Internal Revenue Service.[130][131] In the state Senate, she worked on legislation that reduced property taxes.[132] In 2014, she said she supports a \"fairer, flatter, and simpler\" federal tax code, a reduction in discretionary spending and spending on social programs, and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.[54] In 2017, she voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.[133][102]\n\n\nErnst has expressed support for the partial privatization of Social Security accounts for young workers while making clear that \"we have to keep our promises to seniors\".[32][134][135]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Ernst was one of nine Republican senators to introduce a rescission package meant to fulfill Trump's wish to curb previously approved spending by $15.4 billion as part of an attempt to roll out the legislation to ensure it reached the Senate floor within a 45-day window.[136]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nErnst supports eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, saying she \"believe[s] our children are better educated when it's coming from the state.\"[130][131][54] While states handle almost all education policy decisions, the Department of Education conducts nationwide research, monitors for discrimination, and distributes student financial aid through loans and grants.[130] In 2014, Ernst claimed, inaccurately, that 94% of employees at the Department of Education had been deemed “nonessential” and argued funding would be better spent at the state and local level. *PolitiFact* calculated that hypothetically reassigning all employees to non-federal positions would increase state and local education staffing by “4/100ths of 1 percent”.[137] In February 2017, Ernst voted to confirm Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, saying they shared a belief that those \"closest\" to students know what is best for them.[138][139][140]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nErnst rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and has said that any governmental regulation to address it should be \"very small.\"[54][37] In a 2014 debate, she said, \"I don't know the science behind climate change. I can't say one way or another what is the direct impact from whether it's manmade or not.\"[141][142] In 2018, after the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, detailing the impact of climate change, Ernst said that \"our climate always changes and we see those ebb and flows through time\".[37][143]\n\n\nIn her 2014 Senate campaign, Ernst won support from the Koch brothers and affiliated groups, who helped propel her ahead of a primary opponent who backed a proposal to limit carbon emissions.[35][36] In 2014, she said she is \"adamantly opposed\" to cap-and-trade, a market-based approach to reducing carbon emissions.[54] She supported Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.[144][37]\n\n\nErnst has called for eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency.[130] In 2014, she criticized the impact of the Clean Water Act on farms and businesses and said she would have voted against the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill.[145][32]\n\n\nAfter voting to confirm Trump nominee Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ernst said in 2018 that he had lied to her about upholding the Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates a minimum proportion of ethanol that must be mixed with fuel, while calling Pruitt \"about as swampy as you get\".[146][147][37][148] In February 2019, Ernst voted to confirm Trump's new nominee for EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler.[37] In June 2019, she said she had asked Trump and Wheeler to limit the issuing of RFS waivers, saying they were being handed out \"like candy\" without congressional oversight.[149]\n\n\nAs of September 2020, Ernst has a 1% lifetime score from the environmentalist League of Conservation Voters.[37]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking to Navy Vice Admiral Michael M. Gilday during an Armed Services Committee hearing in 2019\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposed the Iran deal negotiated by the Obama administration.[132] In January 2020, she expressed support for the US military's assassination of Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani by drone strike at Baghdad International Airport.[150]\n\n\n\n#### Iraq[edit]\n\n\nOf the Iraq War and weapons of mass destruction, she said, \"We don't know that there were weapons on the ground when we went in. However, I do have reason to believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That was the intelligence that was operated on. I have reason to believe there was weapons of mass destruction. My husband served in Saudi Arabia as an Army Central Command sergeant major for a year and that's a hot-button topic in that area.\"[54] After criticism from Iowa Democrats and some commentators,[43][151][152] Ernst then issued a statement that she had not meant to suggest that Iraq had WMD at the time of invasion, but rather that Iraq had used WMDs in the past, and that her point was that \"we don't know exactly what happened to those weapons.\"[153]\n\n\nWhen asked whether she supports the limited airstrikes conducted in Iraq in August 2014, Ernst said, \"What I can say is what I would have supported is leaving additional troops in Iraq longer and perhaps we wouldn't have this situation today.\"[154]\n\n\n\n#### Korean conflict[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Ernst questioned Trump's decision to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea.[155] In July, she advocated that the United States continue the exercises in case talks between the US and North Korea did not continue.[156]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ernst with Republican Senators and Defense Secretary Ash Carter at the 2016 International Institute for Strategic Studies Asia Security Summit in Singapore\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ernst called Russia's behavior, including its annexation of Crimea and interference in U.S. elections, \"totally unacceptable\" and said Trump should \"show strength against Vladimir Putin\".[157] The next year, she urged caution if the U.S. worked with Russia to \"put a lid on Iran\", saying that Russia would never be \"a true friend or ally\" to the U.S. She cited North Korea as another case where caution should be maintained when cooperating to make the world \"a safer place\".[158] After the 2018 Russia-United States summit later that month, Ernst expressed hope that Trump had \"delivered a strong message\" that Russia would be punished for its annexation of Ukraine, support of Bashar al-Assad, and \"aggressive actions in U.S. domestic policy\", and that Trump had discussed Russia's actions in the Balkans.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Syrian civil war[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ernst said the U.S. should halt the admission of Syrian refugees, saying the United States needs a \"thorough vetting process\".[160]\n\n\nIn 2018, after missile strikes against Syria, Ernst said that she would be \"uncomfortable\" if Trump wanted to commit more American troops there, saying it was secondary to fighting ISIS.[161] After Trump announced the withdrawal of troops from Syria, Ernst was one of six senators to sign a letter expressing concern, calling the move a \"premature and costly mistake\" that would \"embolden ISIS, Bashar al Assad, Iran, and Russia.\"[162]\n\n\nIn 2019, Ernst was one of six senators to sign a bipartisan letter to Trump calling on him to \"urge Turkey to end their offensive and find a way to a peaceful resolution while supporting our Kurdish partners to ensure regional stability\" and arguing that leaving Syria without installing protections for American allies endangered both them and the US.[163]\n\n\n\n#### Yemen[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Ernst voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.[164] In November 2018, following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Ernst said that Saudi Arabia was a \"great strategic partner\" but that Congress should consider a legislative response due to the commitment of the United States to human rights and the rule of law. She added that Trump should become involved \"if there are indicators coming from those intelligence agencies\".[165] In December, Ernst warned that a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabia-led intervention in Yemen could complicate peace talks in Yemen and that, although Saudi Arabia should be punished for Khashoggi's death, \"those consequences are I see as right now are separate from the discussion of the Saudis and their actions in Yemen engaging the Houthis.\"[166]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nErnst supports open carry legislation, which allows guns to be carried openly in public.[54] In 2019, she was one of 31 Republican cosponsors of a bill to grant those with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to carry concealed weapons in other states with concealed carry laws.[167]\n\n\nIn a 2014 debate, speaking about the Santa Barbara shooting, Ernst said, \"Just because of a horrible, horrible tragedy, I don't believe we should be infringing upon people's Second Amendment rights.\"[128] After the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, she said that mental illness was the \"root cause\" of many mass shootings.[168] She later cosponsored a bill to require federal authorities to inform states within a day if a person failing a background check attempted to buy a firearm.[169][170]\n\n\nIn 2017, amid bipartisan momentum for bump stock restrictions, Ernst was one of 10 Republican senators to sign a letter requesting that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives review a decision that bump stocks fall outside the purview of existing gun regulations.[171]\n\n\nAccording to data from OpenSecrets, the NRA spent $3,124,273 in support of Ernst between 2014 and 2018, mostly attacking candidates running against her.[172]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes the Affordable Care Act.[54] The Campaign for Liberty reported that in 2012 Ernst had answered \"Yes\" to a survey question asking whether she would support legislation that would \"nullify ObamaCare and authorize state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement [it].\"[173][174][175] She voted for all three versions of a bill to repeal the ACA in 2017.[176][177] In 2018, Ernst was one of 10 Republican senators to cosponsor a bill intended to guarantee coverage for people with preexisting conditions, though it would have allowed insurers to exclude coverage for the conditions themselves.[178][179]\n\n\nErnst has expressed support for reforming Medicare and Medicaid and endorsed a partial privatization of both programs in a 2011 Iowa Senate vote. A CBO report found that the plan would increase medical costs for Medicare beneficiaries 61% by 2022, compared with 27% under the existing structure.[180] In 2013, she said there was a \"generation of people that rely on the government to provide absolutely everything for them\" and that removing them from government programs such as the Affordable Care Act \"is going to be very painful\".[181]\n\n\nErnst has questioned the legitimacy of how hospitals are reporting COVID-19 deaths.[182]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Ernst and Democratic senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Patrick Leahy wrote Defense Secretary James Mattis a letter saying they were \"deeply troubled\" by the decision to send 21 Judge Advocate General's Corps to prosecute immigration cases on the southern border, calling it an \"inappropriate misapplication of military personnel\" and urging Mattis to retain the military lawyers within the military justice system.[183]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Ernst was one of 31 Republican senators to submit a resolution endorsing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), saying its abolition would allow \"dangerous criminal aliens\" and members of the MS-13 gang to remain in the U.S.[184]\n\n\nAmid the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown that resulted after Trump demanded $5.7 billion for a border wall, Ernst said she would \"tend to agree that not all areas of our border need a physical barrier\" if they are monitored by technology or Border Patrol agents and it was possible to respond in a \"timely manner\".[185]\n\n\n\n### Internet[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes net neutrality, which prevents internet service providers from blocking or slowing down certain content, and voted against reinstating it after an FCC ruling in 2018.[186][187]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Ernst voted for an amendment co-sponsored by Senators Steve Daines and Ron Wyden that would have required federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies to obtain federal court warrants when collecting web search engine data from American citizens, nationals, or residents under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).[188][189]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2014 debate, Ernst said she believes that same-sex marriage is a state's rights issue, but that she would support a federal ban were one proposed.[190][128] In the Iowa Senate, she co-sponsored a bill to amend the state constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.[32]\n\n\nIn 2017, she announced her opposition to Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces.[191]\n\n\nErnst was one of 12 Republican senators to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate on November 29, 2022.\n\n\n\n### Nullification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference\nAs a state senator, Ernst co-sponsored a resolution urging the \"nullification\" of EPA rules on emissions standards and another expressing the Iowa General Assembly's \"refusal to recognize\" federal laws \"which conflict with the Second Amendment\".[192][193] In 2012, she answered \"Yes\" to a survey asking whether she would support legislation \"nullify[ing] ObamaCare and authoriz[ing] state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement [it].\"[173][174][175]\n\n\nIn 2013, Ernst said Congress should not pass laws \"that the states would consider nullifying\", referring to what she called \"200-plus years of federal legislators going against the Tenth Amendment's states' rights.\"[194] Courts have consistently ruled that nullification is unconstitutional.[194] During her 2014 Senate campaign, Ernst's spokespeople argued that she did not support nullification, and that \"her comments on it were about encouraging Iowans to send her to Washington to pass good laws.\"[195]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Steve King[edit]\n\n\nErnst's relationship with Steve King, a Republican House Representative known for his racist rhetoric and support for far-right politicians, has been criticized. In 2016, when King faced a primary challenge for his House seat, Ernst endorsed him, saying he \"stands strong for life and liberty.\"[196][197] In 2017, when King attracted criticism for saying \"we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies\" and for supporting European far-right politicians, Ernst said she did not condone King's behavior but would not ask for his resignation.[198][199] In 2017, *The Des Moines Register* wrote a scathing editorial against King, which criticized Ernst for endorsing him in the past and not condemning him.[200][201] In 2018, Ernst appeared with King at a rally in his district after King had endorsed a Canadian politician with neo-Nazi ties.[202]\n\n\nIn 2019, amid extensive criticism of King by Republican politicians after King made controversial remarks about white supremacy, Ernst rebuked him.[203] *The New York Times* wrote that Ernst's belated distancing from King might harm her 2020 reelection effort, as she previously \"had spent years embracing Mr. King.\"[204] Art Cullen, editor of *The Storm Lake Times*, criticized the timing of Ernst's response, which came after it started to look possible that King would lose his seat, writing \"the hypocrisy is epic and comic.\"[205] *The Des Moines Register*'s editorial board questioned why it took national condemnation for Ernst to rebuke King.[206] Ernst did not make an endorsement in King's 2020 Republican primary race, which he lost.[207]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, as Trump imposed tariffs as part of his trade policy and other countries responded in kind, Ernst said she was willing to give him some leeway but worried about the impact on farmers.[208] In May 2019, amid a trade war between the United States and China, Ernst said she did not like tariffs but that the \"president's way of negotiating ... brings people to the table.\"[209] She said that Iowa farmers are \"disappointed\" but that they recognize \"that China is the one that is forcing this.\"[210]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Ernst was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting he preserve and modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.[211] In August 2018, she warned that failure to finish trade deals would \"reflect negatively upon our Republican candidates\" and advocated completing NAFTA and continuing to work with the European Union.[212] In 2019, Ernst accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of \"slow-walking\" the passage of the USMCA trade agreement but believed there was enough support to ratify it.[213]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Ernst (then Joni Culver) married Gail Ernst.[214] The Ernsts have one child.[1][2] On August 27, 2018, Ernst announced that she and her husband were in the process of obtaining a divorce.[215] In a sworn affidavit, Ernst said she had declined Trump's offer to be his vice-presidential running mate because \"it wasn't the right thing for me or my family.\"[216] The divorce was finalized in January 2019, with Joni Ernst alleging that Gail had verbally and mentally abused her and on one occasion physically assaulted her. The Ernsts accused each other of infidelity; both denied the respective accusations.[65]\n\n\nIn her first interview after her divorce, Ernst revealed that she had been raped in college.[217]\n\n\nErnst is a lifetime member of the Montgomery County Republican Women, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2265, Montgomery County Court of Honor, Altrusa, PEO Chapter HB, the National Rifle Association of America,[218] and the Montgomery County Farm Bureau.[19] Her church is Mamrelund Lutheran Church in Stanton, Iowa, of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) denomination.[8]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2018, federal judge Linda Reade sentenced Joseph Dierks, of Waterloo, Iowa, to six years in prison for threatening \"to kill or otherwise harm\" Ernst on Twitter. The sentence, which exceeds sentencing guidelines, was imposed on Dierks for disparaging comments he made about Reade and threats against the case prosecutor and his children, and against black corrections officers while awaiting trial.[219]\n\n\nAs of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Ernst's net worth was negative, owing more than $196,000.[220]\n\n\nIn May 2020, she published her memoir, *Daughter of the Heartland: My Ode to the Country That Raised Me*.[221]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nIowa State Senate 12th district Republican primary, 2012[222]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **5,611**  | **99.68%**  |\n|  | Write-in | 18\n | 0.32%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **5,629**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nIowa State Senate 12th district general election, 2012[223]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **22,205**  | **99.06%**  |\n|  | Write-in | 210\n | 0.93%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **22,415**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate Republican primary election in Iowa, 2014[224]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **88,535**  | **56.12%**  |\n|  | Republican | Sam Clovis | 28,418\n | 18.01%\n |\n|  | Republican | Mark Jacobs\n | 26,523\n | 16.81%\n |\n|  | Republican | Matt Whitaker\n | 11,884\n | 7.53%\n |\n|  | Republican | Scott Schaben\n | 2,233\n | 1.42%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 155\n | 0.10%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **157,748**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate general election in Iowa, 2014[225]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **588,575**  | **52.10%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Bruce Braley | 494,370\n | 43.76%\n |\n|  | independent (politician) | Rick Stewart\n | 26,815\n | 2.37%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Douglas Butzier\n | 8,232\n | 0.73%\n |\n|  | Term Limits\n | Bob Quast\n | 5,873\n | 0.52%\n |\n|  | independent (politician) | Ruth Smith\n | 4,724\n | 0.41%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 1,111\n | 0.10%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,129,700**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate Republican primary election in Iowa, 2020[226]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst (incumbent)**  | **226,589**  | **98.63%**  |\n|  | Write-in | 3,132\n | 1.36%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **229,721**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate general election in Iowa, 2020[227]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst (incumbent)**  | **864,997**  | **51.74%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Theresa Greenfield\n | 754,859\n | 45.15%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Rick Stewart\n | 36,961\n | 2.21%\n |\n|  | independent (politician) | Suzanne Herzog\n | 13,800\n | 0.83%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 1,211\n | 0.07%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,671,828**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Iowa portal\n\n\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Emer (November 3, 2014). \"Gail Ernst, Joni Ernst's Husband: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know\". *Heavy*.

As Chair of the Senate Republican Policy Committee since 2023, Ernst is the fourth-ranking Republican in the Senate.\n\n\nAfter graduating from Iowa State University, Ernst joined the United States Army Reserve.[2] She served in the Iowa Army National Guard from 1993 to 2015, retiring as a lieutenant colonel.[3] During the Iraq War, she served as the commanding officer of the 1168th Transportation Company in Kuwait and later commanded the 185th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Camp Dodge, the Iowa Army National Guard's largest battalion.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Ernst also holds a Master of Public Administration from Columbus State University.[14][8]\n\n\nIn 2004, Ernst was elected Montgomery County Auditor.[15] She was reelected in 2008.[8][16][17] In 2011, Ernst was elected to the Iowa State Senate in a special election and reelected in 2012. She represented District 12, in southwestern Iowa.[9][10][18][19] Ernst ran for the United States Senate in 2014 and won, succeeding longtime Democratic Senator Tom Harkin and becoming the first Republican to win that seat since 1978. Having been strongly critical of President Barack Obama, she has been characterized as a reliable ally of President Donald Trump, and was thought to be a possible running mate in his 2016 campaign. Ernst was elected vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference in November 2018.[20] She was reelected in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Theresa Greenfield by 6.6 points.[21]\n\n\nErnst opposes legalized abortion, and has supported a fetal personhood amendment and introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood. She opposes the Affordable Care Act and has called for reforms to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. During the Trump administration, she expressed concern about, although not opposition to, Trump's trade war with China and criticized some aspects of his foreign policy. Ernst voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. While supporting both Trump's nominees for EPA administrator, she expressed concern over their commitment to the Renewable Fuel Standard. She rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. Ernst has opposed a federal minimum wage and advocated for the elimination of federal departments such as the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nErnst was born Joni Kay Culver in Montgomery County, Iowa, the daughter of Marilyn and Richard Culver. She was valedictorian of her class at Stanton Community School District High School.[14] She earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Iowa State University in 1992,[22] and a Master of Public Administration degree from Columbus State University in 1995.[8][14] In college, she took part in an agricultural exchange to the Soviet Union.[23]\n\n\n\n### Military career[edit]\n\n\nErnst joined Iowa State University's ROTC program at age 20 and the United States Army Reserve after graduating.[2] She served as a logistics officer and attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard. In 2003–2004, she spent 12 months in Kuwait as commander of the 1168th Transportation Company, during the Iraq War.[8][9][10][11][24] Near the end of her career, she served as the commanding officer of the 185th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Camp Dodge, the Iowa Army National Guard's largest battalion.[12][13] Upon her retirement from the military in 2015, Ernst had served 23 years in the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard.[3] Her awards included the Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.[4]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Time Magazine* in 2014, Ernst said that she was sexually harassed in the military, saying, \"I had comments, passes, things like that\" that she was able to stop, and said she would support removing investigation and prosecution of sexual assault cases from the chain of command.[25]\n\n\n\n### Iowa politics[edit]\n\n\nErnst was elected Montgomery County Auditor in 2004 and reelected in 2008.[8][16] She was elected to the Iowa State Senate in a special election in 2011 and reelected in 2012. She represented District 12, in southwestern Iowa.[9][10][18][19]\n\n\nFollowing her election to the U.S. Senate, Ernst resigned from the Iowa State Senate, effective November 28, 2014.[26]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in Iowa\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference\nIn July 2013, Ernst announced that she would seek the Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Tom Harkin. Iowa Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds endorsed her in October 2013.[27] In March 2014, Ernst was endorsed by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin,[28][29] to whom she has drawn comparisons.[30][31] In May 2014, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group, endorsed her.[32][33][34]\n\n\nLittle known at the start of her campaign, Ernst was boosted in the Republican primary by the Koch brothers with \"hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of television ads [...] and tens of thousands of dollars in direct campaign contributions\".[35][36][37] A Koch-backed group launched an \"advertising blitz\", including a $257,000 campaign against Ernst's biggest Republican rival, Mark Jacobs, who had supported a proposal to limit carbon emissions that Koch Industries opposed.[35] Ernst privately credited the Kochs and their allies for having \"really started my trajectory\" after her primary victory.[35][36]\n\n\nErnst received widespread attention for a campaign advertisement she released in March 2014, in which she made a tongue-in-cheek comparison between her experience castrating pigs and her ability to \"cut pork\" in Congress.[38][39] Many found the ad humorous,[38][40] and it was spoofed by late-night comedians, including Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert.[41][42][43][44] Before the ad aired, Ernst had struggled to raise money,[45][46] and two polls of the Republican primary taken in February 2014 had shown her in second place, several points behind Mark Jacobs.[47][48] After it aired, a Suffolk University poll in early April showed her with a narrow lead and a Loras College poll showed her essentially tied with Jacobs.[43][49][50][51] By May, she was being described in the media as the \"strong front-runner\".[32]\n\n\nDuring the primary, Ernst promoted a conspiracy theory that a United Nations sustainable development plan, Agenda 21, could lead to farmers being forced off their land and made to live in cities, but a few months later she said she did not consider the plan a \"threat\".[52][53]\n\n\nIn a May 2014 *Des Moines Register* interview, Ernst said she was \"extremely offended\" by comments Jacobs made characterizing her as AWOL due to missing over 100 votes in the legislative session.[54] Previously, in *The Gazette*, Ernst cited her National Guard duty to rebuff criticism about her missing votes,[55] but *The Gazette* found that only 12 of the 117 missed votes came on days when she was on duty. The other 105 missed votes represented 57% of the Iowa Senate votes that session. Ernst's spokesman said she had a better than 90% voting record during her Senate career and that she had never claimed Guard service was the only reason she had missed votes.[55][56]\n\n\nIn July, Ernst delivered the Republican Party's weekly address, criticizing a health care scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs and calling for a balanced budget and reform of Social Security and Medicare.[23] Later that month, she suspended her campaign while participating in two weeks of National Guard duty.[57]\n\n\nIn endorsing her for the Republican primary nomination, the *Des Moines Register* wrote: \"Ernst is a smart, well-prepared candidate who can wrestle with the details of public policy from a conservative perspective without seeming inflexible.\"[58] On October 23, Ernst canceled a scheduled meeting with the *Des Moines Register'*s editorial board, citing the paper's negative editorials about her.[59] The editorial board ultimately endorsed Braley, citing Ernst's calls to abolish the EPA, the Department of Education, and the federal minimum wage, as well as her support for partially privatizing Social Security and overturning the Affordable Care Act.[60][61]\n\n\nIn the 2014 election, Ernst received $17,552,085 in \"dark money\", which constituted 74% of non-party outside spending in her support;[62] she had a $14 million outside spending advantage over her opponent.[36] In an October 2014 debate, Ernst said she “believe[s] in political free speech” and did not see a need to change campaign finance laws.[63]\n\n\nErnst won the 2014 Senate race, 52.2% to 43.7%.[64] She is the first woman elected to represent Iowa in either house of Congress.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in Iowa\n\nErnst ran for reelection in 2020. She was unopposed in the Republican primary and faced Democratic nominee Theresa Greenfield, a businesswoman and former congressional candidate, in the general election. Ernst was seen as the strong favorite and eventually defeated her opponent, 52%-45%.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn December 2019, the Associated Press reported that Ernst's campaign had closely coordinated with a political nonprofit founded by a longtime consultant; such groups are tax-exempt and not required to disclose donors, but cannot make political campaigning their primary purpose and must separate their activities from candidates they support.[69] An Ernst campaign adviser said that any implication they had acted outside the \"spirit of the law\" was \"fake news\". After the article's publication, the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission.[70][71]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking at a campaign event for Marco Rubio in January 2016\nErnst was sworn into the United States Senate on January 3, 2015, and thus became Iowa's first new U.S. senator since Tom Harkin in 1985.[72] She delivered the official Republican response to the State of the Union on January 20.[72][73][74]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Chris Cilizza put Ernst on his short list of possible vice presidential running mates for Donald Trump to become the 45th President of the United States.[75][76] Other media outlets also mentioned her as a possible benefit to Trump's campaign.[77][78][79] On June 16, Ernst said no one had \"reached out\" to her and that she was content with this.[80] On July 4, she and Trump met privately.[81] Trump selected Governor Mike Pence of Indiana on July 15.[82]\n\n\nIn 2016, Ernst and other Republican senators introduced \"Sarah's Law\" in honor of Sarah Root, a 21-year-old student in Omaha who was killed in a street racing crash earlier that year.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ernst's freshman portrait\nIn 2017, Ernst asked Secretary of Defense nominee James Mattis whether he would pledge to cut wasteful spending and stop sexual assault in the military, to which Mattis agreed.[84]\n\n\nIn March, after photographs of nude female soldiers were posted on Facebook, Ernst said that this \"type of activity creates a culture that leads to sexual assault.\"[85] At a press conference two weeks later, she asked Congress to pass a law requiring people to immediately report suspected sexual assault at government facilities.[86]\n\n\nErnst was elected vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference in November 2018.[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ernst (at right) at the signing of the INSPIRE Women Act at the White House, 2017\nOn the initiation of the 116th United States Congress in 2019, Ernst became the first female Republican to be appointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with Marsha Blackburn.[87]\n\n\nIn March 2019, after the Special Counsel Investigation concluded and Attorney General William Barr released an abridged summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, Ernst called for a release of the report's full findings, saying, \"as much of the report that can be made public should be\".[88]\n\n\nIn August 2020, when Iowa had the most new COVID-19 infections per capita of any state in the preceding seven days, Ernst repeated a debunked conspiracy theory that the case numbers were greatly inflated and that health care providers might be falsifying them.[89] She later walked back her statements.[90]\n\n\nAfter Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death in September 2020, Ernst said she supported Trump nominating a new justice before the November presidential election.[91] Eight months before the 2016 presidential election, Ernst opposed Senate consideration of Obama's Supreme Court nominee, saying \"the American people deserve to have a say\" on a decision that would \"impact the course of our country for years to come\".[92][93] In 2018, Ernst reiterated that Supreme Court nominees should not be heard during presidential election years, telling the *Des Moines Register*, \"It's precedent set. ... So come 2020, if there's an opening, I'm sure you'll remind me of that.\"[94]\n\n\nErnst was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. She called the storming \"a protest turned anarchy\" and, citing that she served in the military to defend the right to peacefully protest, \"a complete betrayal of those sacred ideals.\"[95] When Congress returned to the certification process, Ernst voted to support certification.[96] She opposed impeaching Trump for the attack on the Capitol, choosing to support a peaceful transfer of power and \"healing our nation.\"[97] In response, *The Gazette* editorial board wrote that Ernst and Grassley \"must reckon with why they did the wrong thing for so long\" regarding their support of Trump during his presidency.[96]\n\n\nin a September 2021 Fox News interview, Ernst accused President Joe Biden of overstepping presidential powers and \"leading by coercion\"[98] with the newly announced \"Path Out of the Pandemic\"[99] initiative,[98] aimed at mitigating the rising threat of the COVID-19 Delta variant.[100] \"Forcing these federal mandates was one way to divert us\", she said. \"This is a diversion away from 9/11, away from the 20th anniversary and away from the debacle that was his Afghanistan withdrawal\".[98] The previous week, Biden had signed an executive order declassifying 9/11 documents that the victims' families had requested for many years; his agenda on September 11, 2021, included visits to three 9/11 crash sites in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[100]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Cybersecurity\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (Ranking Member)\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade\n\t+ Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship (Ranking Member)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Republican Main Street Partnership[101]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, *Politico* called Ernst \"a reliable vote for most of Trump's agenda\",[102] and as of October 2020, she had voted in line with Donald Trump's positions 91.1% of the time.[103] The American Conservative Union's Center for Legislative Accountability gives Ernst a lifetime conservative score of 81.69.[104] The politically liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave Ernst a score of zero for 2019.[105]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes legalized abortion.[106] In 2013, she voted for a fetal personhood amendment in the Iowa Senate and has said that she would support a federal personhood bill.[107] Critics, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have expressed concern that such an amendment could restrict abortion even in cases of rape or incest, as well as certain forms of birth control, although Ernst has affirmed that she supports access to birth control.[107][108] In January 2020, she petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider *Roe v. Wade*, the landmark ruling that abortion bans are unconstitutional.[109][110]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ernst introduced legislation allowing states to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X grants or reimbursements for treating Medicaid patients, although Planned Parenthood clinics provide multiple family planning services and the funding does not go to abortions except in rare circumstances.[111][112] Ernst supported the 2022 overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, calling it a science-based decision.[113]\n\n\n\n### Barack Obama[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, when asked about President Barack Obama's recess appointments, Ernst called Obama a \"dictator\" who should be \"removed from office\" or face \"impeachment.\"[114] She said, \"He is running amok. He is not following our Constitution.\"[114][115]\n\n\nLater in 2014, Ernst criticized Obama's handling of the Ebola outbreak.[116]\n\n\n\n### Diabetes and price cap for insulin[edit]\n\n\nErnst voted against capping the price of insulin at $35;[117] she has said that she has two family members who are diabetic.[118]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Ernst voted to acquit Trump on both articles of impeachment (abuse of power and obstruction of Congress).[119] She argued that Trump had learned his lesson, and that he would not ask a foreign leader to investigate his rivals again without going through the proper channels.[120][121] At the same time, she suggested that Joe Biden could be impeached if he becomes president over his actions in Ukraine; there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden in regard to Ukraine.[122][123]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Ernst praised Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying, \"he was right on it from day one\".[124]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Ernst voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[125]\n\n\n\n### Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes a federal minimum wage and has said that states should have sole authority to set their minimum wages.[126][127][128] She voted against a minimum wage increase in the state Senate.[128] In response to a Congressional Budget Office report projecting that increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would lift 900,000 people out of poverty but cost 500,000 people their jobs, Ernst said, \"government-mandated wage increases are not the solution.\"[129]\n\n\nErnst has proposed eliminating the Internal Revenue Service.[130][131] In the state Senate, she worked on legislation that reduced property taxes.[132] In 2014, she said she supports a \"fairer, flatter, and simpler\" federal tax code, a reduction in discretionary spending and spending on social programs, and a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.[54] In 2017, she voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.[133][102]\n\n\nErnst has expressed support for the partial privatization of Social Security accounts for young workers while making clear that \"we have to keep our promises to seniors\".[32][134][135]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Ernst was one of nine Republican senators to introduce a rescission package meant to fulfill Trump's wish to curb previously approved spending by $15.4 billion as part of an attempt to roll out the legislation to ensure it reached the Senate floor within a 45-day window.[136]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nErnst supports eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, saying she \"believe[s] our children are better educated when it's coming from the state.\"[130][131][54] While states handle almost all education policy decisions, the Department of Education conducts nationwide research, monitors for discrimination, and distributes student financial aid through loans and grants.[130] In 2014, Ernst claimed, inaccurately, that 94% of employees at the Department of Education had been deemed “nonessential” and argued funding would be better spent at the state and local level. *PolitiFact* calculated that hypothetically reassigning all employees to non-federal positions would increase state and local education staffing by “4/100ths of 1 percent”.[137] In February 2017, Ernst voted to confirm Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, saying they shared a belief that those \"closest\" to students know what is best for them.[138][139][140]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nErnst rejects the scientific consensus on climate change and has said that any governmental regulation to address it should be \"very small.\"[54][37] In a 2014 debate, she said, \"I don't know the science behind climate change. I can't say one way or another what is the direct impact from whether it's manmade or not.\"[141][142] In 2018, after the release of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, detailing the impact of climate change, Ernst said that \"our climate always changes and we see those ebb and flows through time\".[37][143]\n\n\nIn her 2014 Senate campaign, Ernst won support from the Koch brothers and affiliated groups, who helped propel her ahead of a primary opponent who backed a proposal to limit carbon emissions.[35][36] In 2014, she said she is \"adamantly opposed\" to cap-and-trade, a market-based approach to reducing carbon emissions.[54] She supported Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords.[144][37]\n\n\nErnst has called for eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency.[130] In 2014, she criticized the impact of the Clean Water Act on farms and businesses and said she would have voted against the 2014 U.S. Farm Bill.[145][32]\n\n\nAfter voting to confirm Trump nominee Scott Pruitt as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ernst said in 2018 that he had lied to her about upholding the Renewable Fuel Standard, which mandates a minimum proportion of ethanol that must be mixed with fuel, while calling Pruitt \"about as swampy as you get\".[146][147][37][148] In February 2019, Ernst voted to confirm Trump's new nominee for EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler.[37] In June 2019, she said she had asked Trump and Wheeler to limit the issuing of RFS waivers, saying they were being handed out \"like candy\" without congressional oversight.[149]\n\n\nAs of September 2020, Ernst has a 1% lifetime score from the environmentalist League of Conservation Voters.[37]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking to Navy Vice Admiral Michael M. Gilday during an Armed Services Committee hearing in 2019\n#### Iran[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposed the Iran deal negotiated by the Obama administration.[132] In January 2020, she expressed support for the US military's assassination of Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani by drone strike at Baghdad International Airport.[150]\n\n\n\n#### Iraq[edit]\n\n\nOf the Iraq War and weapons of mass destruction, she said, \"We don't know that there were weapons on the ground when we went in. However, I do have reason to believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. That was the intelligence that was operated on. I have reason to believe there was weapons of mass destruction. My husband served in Saudi Arabia as an Army Central Command sergeant major for a year and that's a hot-button topic in that area.\"[54] After criticism from Iowa Democrats and some commentators,[43][151][152] Ernst then issued a statement that she had not meant to suggest that Iraq had WMD at the time of invasion, but rather that Iraq had used WMDs in the past, and that her point was that \"we don't know exactly what happened to those weapons.\"[153]\n\n\nWhen asked whether she supports the limited airstrikes conducted in Iraq in August 2014, Ernst said, \"What I can say is what I would have supported is leaving additional troops in Iraq longer and perhaps we wouldn't have this situation today.\"[154]\n\n\n\n#### Korean conflict[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Ernst questioned Trump's decision to suspend joint military exercises with South Korea.[155] In July, she advocated that the United States continue the exercises in case talks between the US and North Korea did not continue.[156]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ernst with Republican Senators and Defense Secretary Ash Carter at the 2016 International Institute for Strategic Studies Asia Security Summit in Singapore\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Ernst called Russia's behavior, including its annexation of Crimea and interference in U.S. elections, \"totally unacceptable\" and said Trump should \"show strength against Vladimir Putin\".[157] The next year, she urged caution if the U.S. worked with Russia to \"put a lid on Iran\", saying that Russia would never be \"a true friend or ally\" to the U.S. She cited North Korea as another case where caution should be maintained when cooperating to make the world \"a safer place\".[158] After the 2018 Russia-United States summit later that month, Ernst expressed hope that Trump had \"delivered a strong message\" that Russia would be punished for its annexation of Ukraine, support of Bashar al-Assad, and \"aggressive actions in U.S. domestic policy\", and that Trump had discussed Russia's actions in the Balkans.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Syrian civil war[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ernst said the U.S. should halt the admission of Syrian refugees, saying the United States needs a \"thorough vetting process\".[160]\n\n\nIn 2018, after missile strikes against Syria, Ernst said that she would be \"uncomfortable\" if Trump wanted to commit more American troops there, saying it was secondary to fighting ISIS.[161] After Trump announced the withdrawal of troops from Syria, Ernst was one of six senators to sign a letter expressing concern, calling the move a \"premature and costly mistake\" that would \"embolden ISIS, Bashar al Assad, Iran, and Russia.\"[162]\n\n\nIn 2019, Ernst was one of six senators to sign a bipartisan letter to Trump calling on him to \"urge Turkey to end their offensive and find a way to a peaceful resolution while supporting our Kurdish partners to ensure regional stability\" and arguing that leaving Syria without installing protections for American allies endangered both them and the US.[163]\n\n\n\n#### Yemen[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Ernst voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next 30 days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.[164] In November 2018, following the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Ernst said that Saudi Arabia was a \"great strategic partner\" but that Congress should consider a legislative response due to the commitment of the United States to human rights and the rule of law. She added that Trump should become involved \"if there are indicators coming from those intelligence agencies\".[165] In December, Ernst warned that a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabia-led intervention in Yemen could complicate peace talks in Yemen and that, although Saudi Arabia should be punished for Khashoggi's death, \"those consequences are I see as right now are separate from the discussion of the Saudis and their actions in Yemen engaging the Houthis.\"[166]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nErnst supports open carry legislation, which allows guns to be carried openly in public.[54] In 2019, she was one of 31 Republican cosponsors of a bill to grant those with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to carry concealed weapons in other states with concealed carry laws.[167]\n\n\nIn a 2014 debate, speaking about the Santa Barbara shooting, Ernst said, \"Just because of a horrible, horrible tragedy, I don't believe we should be infringing upon people's Second Amendment rights.\"[128] After the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, she said that mental illness was the \"root cause\" of many mass shootings.[168] She later cosponsored a bill to require federal authorities to inform states within a day if a person failing a background check attempted to buy a firearm.[169][170]\n\n\nIn 2017, amid bipartisan momentum for bump stock restrictions, Ernst was one of 10 Republican senators to sign a letter requesting that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives review a decision that bump stocks fall outside the purview of existing gun regulations.[171]\n\n\nAccording to data from OpenSecrets, the NRA spent $3,124,273 in support of Ernst between 2014 and 2018, mostly attacking candidates running against her.[172]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes the Affordable Care Act.[54] The Campaign for Liberty reported that in 2012 Ernst had answered \"Yes\" to a survey question asking whether she would support legislation that would \"nullify ObamaCare and authorize state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement [it].\"[173][174][175] She voted for all three versions of a bill to repeal the ACA in 2017.[176][177] In 2018, Ernst was one of 10 Republican senators to cosponsor a bill intended to guarantee coverage for people with preexisting conditions, though it would have allowed insurers to exclude coverage for the conditions themselves.[178][179]\n\n\nErnst has expressed support for reforming Medicare and Medicaid and endorsed a partial privatization of both programs in a 2011 Iowa Senate vote. A CBO report found that the plan would increase medical costs for Medicare beneficiaries 61% by 2022, compared with 27% under the existing structure.[180] In 2013, she said there was a \"generation of people that rely on the government to provide absolutely everything for them\" and that removing them from government programs such as the Affordable Care Act \"is going to be very painful\".[181]\n\n\nErnst has questioned the legitimacy of how hospitals are reporting COVID-19 deaths.[182]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Ernst and Democratic senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Patrick Leahy wrote Defense Secretary James Mattis a letter saying they were \"deeply troubled\" by the decision to send 21 Judge Advocate General's Corps to prosecute immigration cases on the southern border, calling it an \"inappropriate misapplication of military personnel\" and urging Mattis to retain the military lawyers within the military justice system.[183]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Ernst was one of 31 Republican senators to submit a resolution endorsing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), saying its abolition would allow \"dangerous criminal aliens\" and members of the MS-13 gang to remain in the U.S.[184]\n\n\nAmid the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown that resulted after Trump demanded $5.7 billion for a border wall, Ernst said she would \"tend to agree that not all areas of our border need a physical barrier\" if they are monitored by technology or Border Patrol agents and it was possible to respond in a \"timely manner\".[185]\n\n\n\n### Internet[edit]\n\n\nErnst opposes net neutrality, which prevents internet service providers from blocking or slowing down certain content, and voted against reinstating it after an FCC ruling in 2018.[186][187]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Ernst voted for an amendment co-sponsored by Senators Steve Daines and Ron Wyden that would have required federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies to obtain federal court warrants when collecting web search engine data from American citizens, nationals, or residents under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).[188][189]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2014 debate, Ernst said she believes that same-sex marriage is a state's rights issue, but that she would support a federal ban were one proposed.[190][128] In the Iowa Senate, she co-sponsored a bill to amend the state constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.[32]\n\n\nIn 2017, she announced her opposition to Trump's ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces.[191]\n\n\nErnst was one of 12 Republican senators to vote for the Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate on November 29, 2022.\n\n\n\n### Nullification[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ernst speaking at the 2015 Conservative Political Action Conference\nAs a state senator, Ernst co-sponsored a resolution urging the \"nullification\" of EPA rules on emissions standards and another expressing the Iowa General Assembly's \"refusal to recognize\" federal laws \"which conflict with the Second Amendment\".[192][193] In 2012, she answered \"Yes\" to a survey asking whether she would support legislation \"nullify[ing] ObamaCare and authoriz[ing] state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement [it].\"[173][174][175]\n\n\nIn 2013, Ernst said Congress should not pass laws \"that the states would consider nullifying\", referring to what she called \"200-plus years of federal legislators going against the Tenth Amendment's states' rights.\"[194] Courts have consistently ruled that nullification is unconstitutional.[194] During her 2014 Senate campaign, Ernst's spokespeople argued that she did not support nullification, and that \"her comments on it were about encouraging Iowans to send her to Washington to pass good laws.\"[195]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Steve King[edit]\n\n\nErnst's relationship with Steve King, a Republican House Representative known for his racist rhetoric and support for far-right politicians, has been criticized. In 2016, when King faced a primary challenge for his House seat, Ernst endorsed him, saying he \"stands strong for life and liberty.\"[196][197] In 2017, when King attracted criticism for saying \"we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies\" and for supporting European far-right politicians, Ernst said she did not condone King's behavior but would not ask for his resignation.[198][199] In 2017, *The Des Moines Register* wrote a scathing editorial against King, which criticized Ernst for endorsing him in the past and not condemning him.[200][201] In 2018, Ernst appeared with King at a rally in his district after King had endorsed a Canadian politician with neo-Nazi ties.[202]\n\n\nIn 2019, amid extensive criticism of King by Republican politicians after King made controversial remarks about white supremacy, Ernst rebuked him.[203] *The New York Times* wrote that Ernst's belated distancing from King might harm her 2020 reelection effort, as she previously \"had spent years embracing Mr. King.\"[204] Art Cullen, editor of *The Storm Lake Times*, criticized the timing of Ernst's response, which came after it started to look possible that King would lose his seat, writing \"the hypocrisy is epic and comic.\"[205] *The Des Moines Register*'s editorial board questioned why it took national condemnation for Ernst to rebuke King.[206] Ernst did not make an endorsement in King's 2020 Republican primary race, which he lost.[207]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, as Trump imposed tariffs as part of his trade policy and other countries responded in kind, Ernst said she was willing to give him some leeway but worried about the impact on farmers.[208] In May 2019, amid a trade war between the United States and China, Ernst said she did not like tariffs but that the \"president's way of negotiating ... brings people to the table.\"[209] She said that Iowa farmers are \"disappointed\" but that they recognize \"that China is the one that is forcing this.\"[210]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Ernst was one of 36 Republican senators to sign a letter to Trump requesting he preserve and modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement.[211] In August 2018, she warned that failure to finish trade deals would \"reflect negatively upon our Republican candidates\" and advocated completing NAFTA and continuing to work with the European Union.[212] In 2019, Ernst accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of \"slow-walking\" the passage of the USMCA trade agreement but believed there was enough support to ratify it.[213]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Ernst (then Joni Culver) married Gail Ernst.[214] The Ernsts have one child.[1][2] On August 27, 2018, Ernst announced that she and her husband were in the process of obtaining a divorce.[215] In a sworn affidavit, Ernst said she had declined Trump's offer to be his vice-presidential running mate because \"it wasn't the right thing for me or my family.\"[216] The divorce was finalized in January 2019, with Joni Ernst alleging that Gail had verbally and mentally abused her and on one occasion physically assaulted her. The Ernsts accused each other of infidelity; both denied the respective accusations.[65]\n\n\nIn her first interview after her divorce, Ernst revealed that she had been raped in college.[217]\n\n\nErnst is a lifetime member of the Montgomery County Republican Women, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 2265, Montgomery County Court of Honor, Altrusa, PEO Chapter HB, the National Rifle Association of America,[218] and the Montgomery County Farm Bureau.[19] Her church is Mamrelund Lutheran Church in Stanton, Iowa, of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) denomination.[8]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2018, federal judge Linda Reade sentenced Joseph Dierks, of Waterloo, Iowa, to six years in prison for threatening \"to kill or otherwise harm\" Ernst on Twitter. The sentence, which exceeds sentencing guidelines, was imposed on Dierks for disparaging comments he made about Reade and threats against the case prosecutor and his children, and against black corrections officers while awaiting trial.[219]\n\n\nAs of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Ernst's net worth was negative, owing more than $196,000.[220]\n\n\nIn May 2020, she published her memoir, *Daughter of the Heartland: My Ode to the Country That Raised Me*.[221]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nIowa State Senate 12th district Republican primary, 2012[222]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **5,611**  | **99.68%**  |\n|  | Write-in | 18\n | 0.32%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **5,629**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nIowa State Senate 12th district general election, 2012[223]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **22,205**  | **99.06%**  |\n|  | Write-in | 210\n | 0.93%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **22,415**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate Republican primary election in Iowa, 2014[224]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **88,535**  | **56.12%**  |\n|  | Republican | Sam Clovis | 28,418\n | 18.01%\n |\n|  | Republican | Mark Jacobs\n | 26,523\n | 16.81%\n |\n|  | Republican | Matt Whitaker\n | 11,884\n | 7.53%\n |\n|  | Republican | Scott Schaben\n | 2,233\n | 1.42%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 155\n | 0.10%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **157,748**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate general election in Iowa, 2014[225]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst**  | **588,575**  | **52.10%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Bruce Braley | 494,370\n | 43.76%\n |\n|  | independent (politician) | Rick Stewart\n | 26,815\n | 2.37%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Douglas Butzier\n | 8,232\n | 0.73%\n |\n|  | Term Limits\n | Bob Quast\n | 5,873\n | 0.52%\n |\n|  | independent (politician) | Ruth Smith\n | 4,724\n | 0.41%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 1,111\n | 0.10%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,129,700**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate Republican primary election in Iowa, 2020[226]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst (incumbent)**  | **226,589**  | **98.63%**  |\n|  | Write-in | 3,132\n | 1.36%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **229,721**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate general election in Iowa, 2020[227]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Joni Ernst (incumbent)**  | **864,997**  | **51.74%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Theresa Greenfield\n | 754,859\n | 45.15%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Rick Stewart\n | 36,961\n | 2.21%\n |\n|  | independent (politician) | Suzanne Herzog\n | 13,800\n | 0.83%\n |\n|  | Write-in | 1,211\n | 0.07%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,671,828**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Iowa portal\n\n\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hughes, Emer (November 3, 2014). \"Gail Ernst, Joni Ernst's Husband: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know\". *Heavy*.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 to 2009.\n\n\nBorn and raised in upstate New York, Gillibrand graduated from Dartmouth College and from the UCLA School of Law. After holding positions in government and private practice and working on Hillary Clinton's 2000 U.S. Senate campaign, Gillibrand was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2006. She represented New York's 20th congressional district and was reelected in 2008. During her House tenure, Gillibrand was a Blue Dog Democrat noted for voting against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n\n\nAfter Clinton was appointed U.S. Secretary of State in 2009, Governor David Paterson selected Gillibrand to fill the Senate seat Clinton had vacated, making her New York's second female senator. Gillibrand won a special election in 2010 to keep the seat, and was reelected to full terms in 2012 and 2018. During her Senate tenure, Gillibrand has shifted to the left. She has been outspoken on sexual assault in the military and sexual harassment, having criticized President Bill Clinton, Senator Al Franken, and Governor Andrew Cuomo, all fellow Democrats, for alleged sexual misconduct. She supports paid family leave, a federal jobs guarantee, and the abolition and replacement of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\nGillibrand ran for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020, officially announcing her candidacy on March 17, 2019. After failing to qualify for the third debate, she withdrew from the race on August 28, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKirsten Elizabeth Rutnik was born on December 9, 1966, in Albany, New York, the daughter of Polly Edwina (Noonan) and Douglas Paul Rutnik.[2] Both her parents are attorneys, and her father has also worked as a lobbyist.[3] Her parents divorced in the late 1980s.[4] Douglas Rutnik is an associate of former U.S. Senator Al D'Amato.[5] Gillibrand has an older brother and a younger sister.[6][7] Her maternal grandparents were businessman Peter Noonan and Dorothea \"Polly\" Noonan,[7] a founder of the Albany Democratic Women's Club and a leader of the city's Democratic political machine.[8][5][3][6] Gillibrand has English, Austrian, Scottish, German, and Irish ancestry.[9]\n\n\nPolly Noonan was a longtime confidante of Erastus Corning 2nd, the longtime mayor of Albany, New York.[8][5][3][6] In *Off the Sidelines*, her 2014 memoir, Gillibrand said that Corning \"was simply part of our family... He appeared at every family birthday party with the most fantastic present\". Gillibrand wrote that she did not know that the ambiguous relationship between her married grandmother and the married Corning \"was strange\" until she grew up, adding that Corning \"may have been in love with my grandmother\", but that he also loved her grandmother's entire family.[10] According to *The New York Times*, Corning, \"in effect, disinherited his wife and children\" and \"left the Noonan family his insurance business\".[5][Note 1]\n\n\nDuring her childhood and college years, Gillibrand used the nickname \"Tina\";[11] she began using her birth name a few years after law school.[6] In 1984, she graduated from Emma Willard School, an all-women's private school in Troy, New York,[12] and then enrolled at Dartmouth College.[6] Gillibrand majored in Asian Studies, studying in both Beijing and Taiwan. In Beijing, she studied and lived with actress Connie Britton at Beijing Normal University.[13][14][15] Gillibrand graduated *magna cum laude* in 1988.[16] At Dartmouth, she was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[16] During college, Gillibrand interned at Senator Al D'Amato's Albany office.[17] She received her J.D. from UCLA School of Law and passed the bar exam in 1991.[18]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, Gillibrand joined the Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell as an associate.[4] In 1992, she took a leave from Davis Polk to serve as a law clerk to Judge Roger Miner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Albany.[7][19]\n\n\nGillibrand's tenure at Davis Polk included serving as a defense attorney for tobacco company Philip Morris during major litigation, including both civil lawsuits and U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil racketeering and perjury probes.[20] As a junior associate in the mid-1990s, she defended the company's executives against a criminal investigation into whether they had committed perjury in their testimony before Congress when they claimed that they had no knowledge of a connection between tobacco smoking and cancer. Gillibrand worked closely on the case and became a key part of the defense team.[20] As part of her work, she traveled to the company's laboratory in Germany, where she interviewed scientists about the company's alleged research into the connection. The inquiry was dropped and it was during this time that she became a senior associate.[21][20]\n\n\nWhile working at Davis Polk, Gillibrand became involved in—and later the leader of—the Women's Leadership Forum, a program of the Democratic National Committee. Gillibrand has said that a speech to the group by Hillary Clinton inspired her: \"[Clinton] was trying to encourage us to become more active in politics and she said, 'If you leave all the decision-making to others, you might not like what they do, and you will have no one but yourself to blame.' It was such a challenge to the women in the room. And it really hit me: She's talking to me.\"[4]\n\n\nIn 2001, Gillibrand became a partner in the Manhattan office of Boies, Schiller & Flexner. In 2002 she informed Boies of her interest in running for office and was permitted to transfer to the firm's Albany office. She left Boies in 2005 to begin her 2006 campaign for Congress.[7][20]\n\n\n\n### Public interest and government service[edit]\n\n\nGillibrand has said her work at private law firms allowed her to take on *pro bono* cases defending abused women and their children and tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes.[7] After her time at Davis Polk, she served as Special Counsel to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Andrew Cuomo during the last year of the Clinton administration.[12] Gillibrand worked on HUD's Labor Initiative and its New Markets Initiative, on TAP's Young Leaders of the American Democracy, and on strengthening Davis–Bacon Act enforcement.[22]\n\n\nIn 1999, Gillibrand began working on Hillary Clinton's 2000 U.S. Senate campaign, focusing on campaigning to young women and encouraging them to join the effort. Many of those women later worked on Gillibrand's campaigns.[3] She and Clinton became close during the election, with Clinton becoming something of a mentor to her.[7] Gillibrand donated more than $12,000 to Clinton's Senate campaigns.[23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand's portrait, November 2006\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States House of Representatives elections in New York\n\nGillibrand considered running for office in 2004, in New York's 20th congressional district, against the three-term Republican incumbent John E. Sweeney. But Hillary Clinton believed circumstances would be more favorable in 2006 and advised her to wait until then.[7] Traditionally conservative, the district and its electoral offices had been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1913, and as of November 2006, 197,473 voters in the district were registered Republicans and 82,737 were registered Democrats.[24] Sweeney said in 2006 that \"no Republican can ever lose [the district]\".[25] Using New York's electoral fusion election laws, Gillibrand ran in 2006 on both the Democratic and Working Families lines; in addition to having the Republican nomination, Sweeney was endorsed by the Conservative and Independence parties.[26]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Gillibrand got support from other Democratic Party politicians. Mike McNulty, a Democratic Congressman from the neighboring 21st congressional district, campaigned for her, as did both Hillary and Bill Clinton; the former president appeared twice at campaign events.[27] Both parties poured millions of dollars into the respective campaigns.[28]\n\n\nMany saw Gillibrand as moderate or conservative. Michael Brendan Dougherty in *The American Conservative* wrote after her victory, \"Gillibrand won her upstate New York district by running to the right: she campaigned against amnesty for illegal immigrants, promised to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington, and pledged to protect gun rights.\"[29]\n\n\nGillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was an issue during the campaign. Her campaign finance records showed that she received $23,200 in contributions from the company's employees during her 2006 campaign.[21]\n\n\nThe probable turning point in the election was the November 1 release of a December 2005 police report detailing a 9-1-1 call by Sweeney's wife, in which she claimed Sweeney was \"knocking her around the house\". The Sweeney campaign claimed the police report was false and promised to have the official report released by state police, but did not do so.[27] The Sweeney campaign did release an ad in which Sweeney's wife called Gillibrand's campaign \"a disgrace\".[30] Several months later, Sweeney's wife said her \"disgrace\" statement was coerced, and that her husband was physically abusive.[31]\n\n\nBy November 5, a Siena poll showed Gillibrand ahead of Sweeney 46% to 43%.[32] She won with 53% of the vote.[26]\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in New York\n\nAfter Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about possible 2008 candidates. Len Cutler, director of the Center for the Study of Government and Politics at Siena College, said that the seat would be difficult for Gillibrand to hold in 2008, with Republicans substantially outnumbering Democrats in the district.[27]\n\n\nGillibrand was reelected in 2008 over former New York Secretary of State Sandy Treadwell, 62% to 38%.[33] Treadwell lost despite significantly outspending Gillibrand and promising never to vote to raise taxes, not to accept a federal salary, and to limit himself to three terms in office.[34] Campaign expenditures were the second highest in the nation for a House race.[35] Democrats generally saw major successes during the 2008 congressional elections, credited in part to a coattail effect from Barack Obama's presidential campaign.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed that she received $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions.[20] Questioned during the campaign about her work on behalf of Philip Morris, Gillibrand said that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for.[21] Davis Polk allowed associates to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.[20]\n\n\n\n### House tenure[edit]\n\n\nUpon taking office, Gillibrand joined the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate to conservative Democrats. She was noted for voting against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[29] citing concerns regarding insufficient oversight and excessive earmarks.[36] She opposed a 2007 state-level proposal to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and voted for legislation that would withhold federal funds from immigrant sanctuary cities.[37][38] Gillibrand also voted for a bill that limited information-sharing between federal agencies about firearm purchasers and received an \"A\" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF).[39][7] This fell to an \"F\" rating during her time in Senate.[39] She expressed personal support for same-sex marriage, but advocated for civil unions for same-sex couples and said same-sex marriage should a state-level issue.[40]\n\n\nAfter taking office, Gillibrand became the first member of Congress to publish her official schedule, listing everyone she met with on a given day. She also published earmark requests she received and her personal financial statement. This \"Sunlight Report\", as her office termed it, was praised by in a December 2006 *New York Times* editorial as a \"quiet touch of revolution\" in a non-transparent system.[41][42] Of the earmarking process, Gillibrand said she wanted whatever was best for her district and would require every project to pass a \"greatest-need, greatest-good\" test.[43]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Gillibrand served on the following committees:[44]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit, Energy, and Research\n\t+ Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry (Chair)\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces\n\t+ Subcommittee on Terrorism and Unconventional Threats\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. senator from New York, as Secretary of State. Clinton was confirmed by a vote of 94–2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her Senate seat, effective immediately. Obama's December announcement began a two-month search to fill her Senate seat.[45] Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 for the remainder of her term, which ended in January 2013.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand campaigning for her Democratic House successor Scott Murphy (2009)\nGovernor David Paterson's selection process began with a number of prominent names and high-profile New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer.[6] Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice in the days before the official announcement.[47] On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.[48]\n\n\nThe response to the appointment in New York was mixed. Upstate New York media was generally optimistic about the appointment of an upstate senator,[49] as none had been elected since Charles Goodell left office in 1971.[50] Many downstaters were disappointed with the selection, with some media outlets stating that Paterson had ignored the electoral influence of New York City and downstate on state politics. One questioned whether Paterson's administration was aware of \"[where] statewide elections are won and lost\".[49] Gillibrand was relatively unknown statewide, and many voters found the choice surprising.[12] One source stated, \"With every Democrat in New York ... angling for the appointment, there was a sense of bafflement, belittlement, and bruised egos when Paterson tapped the junior legislator unknown outside of Albany.\"[6]\n\n\nShortly before her appointment to the Senate was announced, Gillibrand reportedly contacted the Empire State Pride Agenda, an LGBT lobbying organization in New York, to express her full support for same-sex marriage, the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy regarding gay and lesbian servicemembers, and the passage of legislation banning discrimination against transgender persons.[51][52] She had supported civil unions for same-sex couples[52] and argued that the same-sex marriage issue should be left to states.[40] Paterson's office had advised her to reach out to Empire State Pride.[53][52]\n\n\nGillibrand was sworn in on January 26, 2009; at 42, she entered the chamber as the youngest senator in the 111th Congress.[6] In February, she endorsed Scott Murphy, whom New York Democrats chose as their nominee for her former seat in the House of Representatives.[54] In April, Murphy won the seat against Republican Jim Tedisco by 399 votes and succeeded Gillibrand in the House until 2011.[55]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand is sworn in for her second term by Vice President Biden (2011)\nMain article: 2010 United States Senate special election in New York\n\nGillibrand had numerous potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic primary election. Some were obvious at the time of her appointment. Most notably, Representative Carolyn McCarthy was unhappy with Gillibrand's stance on gun control,[56][Note 2] but McCarthy decided not to run.[57] Harold Ford, Jr., a former Congressman from Tennessee, considered a run but decided against it in March 2009.[58]\n\n\nConcerned about a possible schism in the party that could lead to a heated primary, split electorate, and weakened stance, high-ranking members of the party backed Gillibrand and requested major opponents not to run.[58] In the end, Gillibrand faced Gail Goode, a lawyer from New York City,[59] and won the primary with 76% of the vote.[60]\n\n\nDespite what was expected to be a heated race, Gillibrand easily prevailed against former Republican congressman Joseph DioGuardi in her first statewide election.[61] By the end of October, a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed Gillibrand leading 57%-34%.[62] Gillibrand won the November election 63%–35%, carrying 54 of New York's 62 counties; the counties that supported DioGuardi did so by a margin no greater than 10%.[61]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in New York\n\nGillibrand's special election victory gave her the right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, she faced Wendy E. Long, an attorney running on both the Republican Party and Conservative Party lines.[63][64] Gillibrand was endorsed by *The New York Times*[65] and the *Democrat and Chronicle*.[66] She won the election with 72.2% of the vote;[67] in so doing, she surpassed Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004 and achieved the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in New York\n\nGillibrand was reelected to a second term in the Senate, defeating Republican Chele Chiavacci Farley[69] with 67% of the vote.[70] During a campaign debate, she pledged that she would serve out a full six-year term if reelected.[71] She was endorsed by the progressive groups Indivisible[72][73] and Working Families.[74][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Senate tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand (2010)\nA member of the Democratic Party's relatively conservative Blue Dog faction while in the House, Gillibrand has moved her political positions and ideology toward a liberal, progressive position since her appointment to the Senate.[75][76] In both cases, her views were significantly defined by the respective constituencies she served[77]—a conservative congressional district versus the generally liberal state of New York, especially as defined by New York City. For example, although she had been quiet on the U.S. military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy when she was in the House, during her first 18 months in the Senate, Gillibrand was an important part of the successful campaign to repeal it.[78]\n\n\nGillibrand made national headlines in February 2009 for stating that she and her husband kept two guns under their bed.[79][80][81] Her staff later indicated that Gillibrand no longer stored guns under her bed.[82]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2009, a combined Schumer–Gillibrand press release said that the two strongly supported a Latino being nominated to the Supreme Court at the time of the next vacancy. Their first choice was Sonia Sotomayor.[83] The two introduced her at Sotomayor's Senate confirmation hearing in July 2009.[84]\n\n\nDuring the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, Gillibrand scored two substantial legislative victories: the passage of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Both were issues she had advocated for during that session. In the aftermath of these victories, Gillibrand gained a more prominent national profile.[85][86][87]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Gillibrand co-sponsored the PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights,[88] but ultimately announced she would not support the bill as-is due to wide critical public response.[89]\n\n\nIn 2012, Gillibrand authored a portion of the STOCK Act, which extended limitations on insider trading by members of Congress. A version of the bill, merged by Senator Joe Lieberman with content from another bill authored by Senator Scott Brown,[90] was passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in April.[91]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gillibrand proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command; the bill was cosponsored by Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.[92] Gillibrand's bill failed to gain enough votes to break a filibuster in March 2014, but her efforts likely improved her standing as a lawmaker in the Senate.[93]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Gillibrand introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would have provided paid family leave.[94]\n\n\nBy 2013, Gillibrand had \"skillfully aligned herself with causes with visible, moving human characters who have helped amplified her policy goals\".[95] For example, in campaigning for the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, she established a website with videos of gay and lesbian veterans telling their personal stories.[95] She has been less deferential to Senate seniority protocols and more uncompromising in her positions—such as combating sexual assault in the military—than most freshman senators, which has sometimes caused friction with her Democratic colleagues. Senator Charles Grassley has contrasted her approach with other New Yorkers of both parties, saying she is distinguished by \"her determination and knowledge and willingness to sit down one on one with senators and explain what she is up to\". Her fund-raising ability—almost $30 million from 2009 through 2013—helped her become a mentor to female candidates nationwide during that period.[95]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand speaking at a White House summit (2014)\nIn 2014, Gillibrand was included in the annual *Time* 100, *Time* magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[96]\n\n\nIn 2015, Gillibrand invited campus activist Emma Sulkowicz to attend the State of the Union Address. Her invitation was intended to promote the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, a bill Gillibrand co-sponsored.[97]\n\n\nGillibrand once supported legislation that would criminalize \"boycotts\" by individuals or groups seeking to express a disapproval of the actions taken by the government of Israel.[98] Gillibrand's advocacy against protests and \"boycotts\" included her co-sponsoring S.720, coined the \"Israel Anti-Boycott Act\". This legislation would have criminalized any political boycott intended to protest actions by the Israeli government, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.[98][99][100] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) denounced S.720, claiming its provisions seeking to \"punish U.S. persons based solely on their expressed political beliefs\" are \"inconsistent\" with First Amendment constitutional protections.[101] In July 2017, Gillibrand stated that she no longer supported the bill in its then-current form, adding that she would advocate for changes to it. She said the bill did not \"have any relevance to individuals at all\" and insisted she planned to \"urge them to rewrite it to make sure it says...'This is only applying to companies.'\"[102]\n\n\nIn a February 2018 *60 Minutes* profile, Gillibrand said she was \"'embarrassed and ashamed'\" of the positions on immigration and guns she held during her tenure in the House of Representatives.[103]\n\n\nGillibrand was named as part of the \"Hell-No Caucus\" by *Politico* in 2018, along with Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, for voting \"overwhelmingly to thwart [Trump's] nominees for administration jobs\", such as with Rex Tillerson, Betsy DeVos, and Mike Pompeo; all the senators were considered potential 2020 presidential contenders at the time,[104] and all five did run for president in 2020.\n\n\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight study, 12% of Gillibrand's votes matched Trump's position, the lowest among all senators.[105]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### Current[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Marketing and Agriculture Security (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy, Science and Technology\n\t+ Subcommittee on Hunger, Nutrition and Family Farms\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Personnel\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Strategic Forces\n* Special Committee on Aging\n* Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n\n#### Previous[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works (2009-2021)\n* Committee on Foreign Relations (2009-2011)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Healthy Kids Caucus\n* International Conservation Caucus\n* Senate Women's Caucus\n* Sportsmen's Caucus\n* Afterschool Caucuses[106]\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gillibrand 2020 |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Campaign | 2020 United States presidential election (Democratic Party primaries) |\n| Candidate | **Kirsten Gillibrand**Senator from New York (2009–)Member of the House from New York (2007–2009) |\n| EC formed | January 15, 2019 |\n| Launched | March 17, 2019 |\n| Suspended | August 28, 2019 |\n| Headquarters | Troy, New York[107] |\n| Key people | Jess Fassler (campaign manager)[108] |\n| Receipts | US$15,919,261.11[109] (September 30, 2019) |\n| Slogan | Brave Wins |\n\n\n### Exploratory committee[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2019, on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, Gillibrand announced the formation of an exploratory committee to consider running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] During her January 15 appearance, she said, \"I am going to run\",[111] and the same day paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission established the Gillibrand 2020 Exploratory Committee.[112] Gillibrand had frequently been mentioned as a possible 2020 contender by the media before her announcement,[113][114] but during a 2018 Senate campaign debate, she had promised to serve her entire six-year term if she were reelected.[71]\n\n\n\n### Campaign announcement and suspension[edit]\n\n\nIn a Twitter post on March 17, Gillibrand announced that she was officially running for president.[115][116] Like other Democratic candidates, she pledged not to accept campaign donations from political action committees.[117]\n\n\nGillibrand was invited to the first Democratic presidential debate, participating on the second night, on June 27. She was also invited to the second debate, again participating in the second night, on July 31.[118]\n\n\nGillibrand suspended her campaign on August 28, 2019, citing her failure to qualify for the third round of Democratic primary debates.[119][120] She neither met the polling threshold nor sustained the fundraising quota set as debate qualifications.[119]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand speaking to the California Democratic Party State Convention in June 2019.\nMain article: Endorsements in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries § Kirsten Gillibrand\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Kirsten Gillibrand\n\nDuring her tenure in the House of Representatives, Gillibrand was known as a centrist Democrat.[121][122] In the House, she was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition,[123][124] a caucus of fiscally conservative Democrats;[125] she also voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[29][36] spoke against the issuance of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, and voted for a bill that would withhold federal funds from immigrant sanctuary cities.[37][38] Gillibrand also voted for a bill that limited information-sharing between federal agencies about firearm purchasers[7] and advocated for civil unions for same-sex couples.[40]\n\n\nSince she became a member of the Senate, Gillibrand's political positions have moved leftward.[126][40] In July 2018, *Newsday* wrote that Gillibrand \"formerly held more conservative views on guns and immigration, but, in her nine years as New York's junior senator, [has] swung steadily to the left on those and other issues\".[127] After being appointed to the Senate, she expressed support for same-sex marriage.[51][53] A supporter of gun rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction of gun control.[128][121] She has said that a conversation with a family who had lost a daughter to gun violence made her realize that she was \"wrong\" to oppose gun control measures; having once received an \"A\" rating from the NRA, she received an \"F\" rating as of 2018.[121][127] In June 2018, Gillibrand called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, a \"deportation force\" and became the first sitting senator to support the call to abolish ICE. She said, \"I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works\" and \"I think you should reimagine ICE under a new agency with a very different mission\".[127][129][130][131]\n\n\nIn May 2018, *City & State* reported that Gillibrand had \"moved sharply leftward on economic issues, embracing a number of proposals to expand the social safety net and bolster lower-income families\".[132] In July 2018, *The New York Times* wrote that Gillibrand had \"spent recent months injecting her portfolio with a dose of the kind of economic populism that infused Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign in the 2016 presidential primary\".[133]\n\n\nIn a 2019 reversal of a past position, Gillibrand stated her support for driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.[134]\n\n\nOn social issues, Gillibrand is generally liberal, supporting abortion rights[135] and helping lead the successful repeal effort of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\".[121] A supporter of Medicare-for-all since her first House run in 2006,[133] she co-sponsored a 2017 Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sanders and said that health care should be a right.[136] Gillibrand also supports a federal jobs guarantee. Although she used to be one of the top recipients of corporate campaign donations, in 2018 she supported rejecting corporate PAC funds and invested heavily in online fundraising. Ninety-seven percent of donations to her 2018 campaign totaled $100 or less.[133] She advocates government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information.[137]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Gillibrand co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[99][138] In July 2017, Gillibrand said she no longer supported the bill in its then-current form, adding that she would advocate for changes to it. She said the bill did not \"have any relevance to individuals at all\" and insisted she planned to \"urge them to rewrite it to make sure it says...'This is only applying to companies.'\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2018, Gillibrand said she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" of the positions on guns and immigration she took during her House tenure.[103]\n\n\n\n### #MeToo movement[edit]\n\n\nGillibrand has gone against her party on a number of occasions on issues related to women's rights.[121] Declaring a \"zero tolerance\" doctrine regarding accusations of sexual misconduct by members of Congress, Gillibrand was the first in her caucus to call on Senator Al Franken to resign.[139] Franken left office before a Senate Ethics Committee investigation could review the accuracy of the allegations against him.[140][141] In 2019, seven Democratic current and former U.S. senators who had demanded Franken's resignation in 2017 told *New Yorker* reporter Jane Mayer they had been wrong to do so, but Gillibrand has expressed no regrets for leading the demand for his resignation.[142]\nIn November 2017, amid the MeToo movement, Gillibrand became the first high-profile Democrat to say that Bill Clinton should have resigned when his affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed.[121][143] In 2018, Clinton expressed disagreement with Gillibrand's opinion.[144]\n\n\nIn 2019, a female former aide to Gillibrand criticized her for retaining a male staffer despite the aide's sexual harassment complaint against him.[145]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand with her husband and sons on Halloween, 2009\n![](image)Gillibrand is joined by her husband and her son Henry during a presidential campaign appearance at the Iowa State Fair\nGillibrand met her husband, Jonathan Gillibrand, a venture capitalist and British national, on a blind date. Jonathan planned to be in the United States for only a year while studying for his Master of Business Administration at Columbia University, but he stayed in the country because of their developing relationship. They married in a Catholic church in Manhattan in 2001.[4][6]\n\n\nThe Gillibrands had their first son, Theodore, in 2003,[7] and their second son, Henry, in 2008. Gillibrand continued to work until the day of Henry's delivery and received a standing ovation from her colleagues in the House for doing so.[7]\n\n\nBecause of the requirements of Gillibrand's office, the family spends most of its time in Washington, D.C.[7][146] In 2011, the Gillibrands sold their house in Hudson and purchased their home in Brunswick to be closer to Gillibrand's family in Albany.[147] In 2020, the Gillibrands sold their house in Brunswick.[148] Gillibrand stated in 2020 that her family was looking for a house in the North Country.[149]\n\n\nGillibrand was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society, as an *honoris causa* initiate at SUNY Plattsburgh in 2012.[150]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Gillibrand published her first book, *Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World*.[151] The candid memoir was notable in the media upon release due to whisperings of a future presidential run[152] as well as Gillibrand's claims of sexism in the Senate,[153] including specific comments made to her by other members of Congress about her weight and appearance.[154] *Off the Sidelines* debuted at number 8 on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.[155]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nNew York 20th congressional district election, 2006[26]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 116,416\n |  |  |\n|  | Working Families | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 3,839\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** | 125,168\n | 53.10\n |  |\n|  | Republican | John Sweeney\n | 94,093\n |  |  |\n|  | Conservative | John Sweeney\n | 9,869\n |  |  |\n|  | Independence | John Sweeney\n | 6,592\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | John Sweeney | 110,554\n | 46.90\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 14,614\n |  |  |\n| Turnout | 235,722\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2008 New York's 20th congressional district election[156]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 178,996\n |  |  |\n|  | Working Families | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 14,655\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** | 193,651\n | 62.13\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Sandy Treadwell\n | 99,930\n |  |  |\n|  | Conservative | Sandy Treadwell\n | 10,077\n |  |  |\n|  | Independence | Sandy Treadwell\n | 8,024\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | Sandy Treadwell | 118,031\n | 37.87\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 75,620\n |  |  |\n| Turnout | 311,682\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n.9\n\n\n\n2010 U.S. Senate Democratic primary in New York[157]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Kirsten Gillibrand (Incumbent)**  | **464,512**  | **76.1%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Gail Goode\n | 145,491\n | 23.9%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **610,003**  | **100.00%**  |\n\n\n\n\n2010 U.S. Senate election in New York[158]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | Kirsten Gillibrand (Incumbent)\n | 2,479,310\n |  |  |\n|  | Working Families | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 182,648\n |  |  |\n|  | Independence | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 175,631\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** **(Incumbent)** | **2,837,589** | **62.95%** |  |\n|  | Republican | Joe DioGuardi\n | 1,338,239\n |  |  |\n|  | Conservative | Joe DioGuardi\n | 244,364\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | Joe DioGuardi | 1,582,603\n | 35.11%\n |  |\n|  | Green | Cecile A.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served as member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2007 to 2009.\n\n\nBorn and raised in upstate New York, Gillibrand graduated from Dartmouth College and from the UCLA School of Law. After holding positions in government and private practice and working on Hillary Clinton's 2000 U.S. Senate campaign, Gillibrand was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2006. She represented New York's 20th congressional district and was reelected in 2008. During her House tenure, Gillibrand was a Blue Dog Democrat noted for voting against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\n\n\nAfter Clinton was appointed U.S. Secretary of State in 2009, Governor David Paterson selected Gillibrand to fill the Senate seat Clinton had vacated, making her New York's second female senator. Gillibrand won a special election in 2010 to keep the seat, and was reelected to full terms in 2012 and 2018. During her Senate tenure, Gillibrand has shifted to the left. She has been outspoken on sexual assault in the military and sexual harassment, having criticized President Bill Clinton, Senator Al Franken, and Governor Andrew Cuomo, all fellow Democrats, for alleged sexual misconduct. She supports paid family leave, a federal jobs guarantee, and the abolition and replacement of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\nGillibrand ran for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020, officially announcing her candidacy on March 17, 2019. After failing to qualify for the third debate, she withdrew from the race on August 28, 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKirsten Elizabeth Rutnik was born on December 9, 1966, in Albany, New York, the daughter of Polly Edwina (Noonan) and Douglas Paul Rutnik.[2] Both her parents are attorneys, and her father has also worked as a lobbyist.[3] Her parents divorced in the late 1980s.[4] Douglas Rutnik is an associate of former U.S. Senator Al D'Amato.[5] Gillibrand has an older brother and a younger sister.[6][7] Her maternal grandparents were businessman Peter Noonan and Dorothea \"Polly\" Noonan,[7] a founder of the Albany Democratic Women's Club and a leader of the city's Democratic political machine.[8][5][3][6] Gillibrand has English, Austrian, Scottish, German, and Irish ancestry.[9]\n\n\nPolly Noonan was a longtime confidante of Erastus Corning 2nd, the longtime mayor of Albany, New York.[8][5][3][6] In *Off the Sidelines*, her 2014 memoir, Gillibrand said that Corning \"was simply part of our family... He appeared at every family birthday party with the most fantastic present\". Gillibrand wrote that she did not know that the ambiguous relationship between her married grandmother and the married Corning \"was strange\" until she grew up, adding that Corning \"may have been in love with my grandmother\", but that he also loved her grandmother's entire family.[10] According to *The New York Times*, Corning, \"in effect, disinherited his wife and children\" and \"left the Noonan family his insurance business\".[5][Note 1]\n\n\nDuring her childhood and college years, Gillibrand used the nickname \"Tina\";[11] she began using her birth name a few years after law school.[6] In 1984, she graduated from Emma Willard School, an all-women's private school in Troy, New York,[12] and then enrolled at Dartmouth College.[6] Gillibrand majored in Asian Studies, studying in both Beijing and Taiwan. In Beijing, she studied and lived with actress Connie Britton at Beijing Normal University.[13][14][15] Gillibrand graduated *magna cum laude* in 1988.[16] At Dartmouth, she was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[16] During college, Gillibrand interned at Senator Al D'Amato's Albany office.[17] She received her J.D. from UCLA School of Law and passed the bar exam in 1991.[18]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, Gillibrand joined the Manhattan-based law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell as an associate.[4] In 1992, she took a leave from Davis Polk to serve as a law clerk to Judge Roger Miner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Albany.[7][19]\n\n\nGillibrand's tenure at Davis Polk included serving as a defense attorney for tobacco company Philip Morris during major litigation, including both civil lawsuits and U.S. Justice Department criminal and civil racketeering and perjury probes.[20] As a junior associate in the mid-1990s, she defended the company's executives against a criminal investigation into whether they had committed perjury in their testimony before Congress when they claimed that they had no knowledge of a connection between tobacco smoking and cancer. Gillibrand worked closely on the case and became a key part of the defense team.[20] As part of her work, she traveled to the company's laboratory in Germany, where she interviewed scientists about the company's alleged research into the connection. The inquiry was dropped and it was during this time that she became a senior associate.[21][20]\n\n\nWhile working at Davis Polk, Gillibrand became involved in—and later the leader of—the Women's Leadership Forum, a program of the Democratic National Committee. Gillibrand has said that a speech to the group by Hillary Clinton inspired her: \"[Clinton] was trying to encourage us to become more active in politics and she said, 'If you leave all the decision-making to others, you might not like what they do, and you will have no one but yourself to blame.' It was such a challenge to the women in the room. And it really hit me: She's talking to me.\"[4]\n\n\nIn 2001, Gillibrand became a partner in the Manhattan office of Boies, Schiller & Flexner. In 2002 she informed Boies of her interest in running for office and was permitted to transfer to the firm's Albany office. She left Boies in 2005 to begin her 2006 campaign for Congress.[7][20]\n\n\n\n### Public interest and government service[edit]\n\n\nGillibrand has said her work at private law firms allowed her to take on *pro bono* cases defending abused women and their children and tenants seeking safe housing after lead paint and unsafe conditions were found in their homes.[7] After her time at Davis Polk, she served as Special Counsel to Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Andrew Cuomo during the last year of the Clinton administration.[12] Gillibrand worked on HUD's Labor Initiative and its New Markets Initiative, on TAP's Young Leaders of the American Democracy, and on strengthening Davis–Bacon Act enforcement.[22]\n\n\nIn 1999, Gillibrand began working on Hillary Clinton's 2000 U.S. Senate campaign, focusing on campaigning to young women and encouraging them to join the effort. Many of those women later worked on Gillibrand's campaigns.[3] She and Clinton became close during the election, with Clinton becoming something of a mentor to her.[7] Gillibrand donated more than $12,000 to Clinton's Senate campaigns.[23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand's portrait, November 2006\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States House of Representatives elections in New York\n\nGillibrand considered running for office in 2004, in New York's 20th congressional district, against the three-term Republican incumbent John E. Sweeney. But Hillary Clinton believed circumstances would be more favorable in 2006 and advised her to wait until then.[7] Traditionally conservative, the district and its electoral offices had been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1913, and as of November 2006, 197,473 voters in the district were registered Republicans and 82,737 were registered Democrats.[24] Sweeney said in 2006 that \"no Republican can ever lose [the district]\".[25] Using New York's electoral fusion election laws, Gillibrand ran in 2006 on both the Democratic and Working Families lines; in addition to having the Republican nomination, Sweeney was endorsed by the Conservative and Independence parties.[26]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Gillibrand got support from other Democratic Party politicians. Mike McNulty, a Democratic Congressman from the neighboring 21st congressional district, campaigned for her, as did both Hillary and Bill Clinton; the former president appeared twice at campaign events.[27] Both parties poured millions of dollars into the respective campaigns.[28]\n\n\nMany saw Gillibrand as moderate or conservative. Michael Brendan Dougherty in *The American Conservative* wrote after her victory, \"Gillibrand won her upstate New York district by running to the right: she campaigned against amnesty for illegal immigrants, promised to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington, and pledged to protect gun rights.\"[29]\n\n\nGillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was an issue during the campaign. Her campaign finance records showed that she received $23,200 in contributions from the company's employees during her 2006 campaign.[21]\n\n\nThe probable turning point in the election was the November 1 release of a December 2005 police report detailing a 9-1-1 call by Sweeney's wife, in which she claimed Sweeney was \"knocking her around the house\". The Sweeney campaign claimed the police report was false and promised to have the official report released by state police, but did not do so.[27] The Sweeney campaign did release an ad in which Sweeney's wife called Gillibrand's campaign \"a disgrace\".[30] Several months later, Sweeney's wife said her \"disgrace\" statement was coerced, and that her husband was physically abusive.[31]\n\n\nBy November 5, a Siena poll showed Gillibrand ahead of Sweeney 46% to 43%.[32] She won with 53% of the vote.[26]\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in New York\n\nAfter Gillibrand's win, Republicans quickly began speculating about possible 2008 candidates. Len Cutler, director of the Center for the Study of Government and Politics at Siena College, said that the seat would be difficult for Gillibrand to hold in 2008, with Republicans substantially outnumbering Democrats in the district.[27]\n\n\nGillibrand was reelected in 2008 over former New York Secretary of State Sandy Treadwell, 62% to 38%.[33] Treadwell lost despite significantly outspending Gillibrand and promising never to vote to raise taxes, not to accept a federal salary, and to limit himself to three terms in office.[34] Campaign expenditures were the second highest in the nation for a House race.[35] Democrats generally saw major successes during the 2008 congressional elections, credited in part to a coattail effect from Barack Obama's presidential campaign.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGillibrand's legal representation of Philip Morris was again an issue. Her campaign finance records showed that she received $18,200 from Philip Morris employees for her 2008 campaign, putting her among the top dozen Democrats in such contributions.[20] Questioned during the campaign about her work on behalf of Philip Morris, Gillibrand said that she had voted in favor of all three anti-tobacco bills in that session of Congress. She said that she never hid her work for Philip Morris, and added that as an associate at her law firm, she had had no control over which clients she worked for.[21] Davis Polk allowed associates to withdraw from representing clients about whom they had moral qualms.[20]\n\n\n\n### House tenure[edit]\n\n\nUpon taking office, Gillibrand joined the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate to conservative Democrats. She was noted for voting against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[29] citing concerns regarding insufficient oversight and excessive earmarks.[36] She opposed a 2007 state-level proposal to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and voted for legislation that would withhold federal funds from immigrant sanctuary cities.[37][38] Gillibrand also voted for a bill that limited information-sharing between federal agencies about firearm purchasers and received an \"A\" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF).[39][7] This fell to an \"F\" rating during her time in Senate.[39] She expressed personal support for same-sex marriage, but advocated for civil unions for same-sex couples and said same-sex marriage should a state-level issue.[40]\n\n\nAfter taking office, Gillibrand became the first member of Congress to publish her official schedule, listing everyone she met with on a given day. She also published earmark requests she received and her personal financial statement. This \"Sunlight Report\", as her office termed it, was praised by in a December 2006 *New York Times* editorial as a \"quiet touch of revolution\" in a non-transparent system.[41][42] Of the earmarking process, Gillibrand said she wanted whatever was best for her district and would require every project to pass a \"greatest-need, greatest-good\" test.[43]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Gillibrand served on the following committees:[44]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit, Energy, and Research\n\t+ Subcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry (Chair)\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces\n\t+ Subcommittee on Terrorism and Unconventional Threats\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2008, President-elect Barack Obama announced his choice of Hillary Clinton, the junior U.S. senator from New York, as Secretary of State. Clinton was confirmed by a vote of 94–2 on January 21, 2009. Just hours before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton resigned her Senate seat, effective immediately. Obama's December announcement began a two-month search to fill her Senate seat.[45] Under New York law, the governor appoints a replacement. A special election would then be held in November 2010 for the remainder of her term, which ended in January 2013.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand campaigning for her Democratic House successor Scott Murphy (2009)\nGovernor David Paterson's selection process began with a number of prominent names and high-profile New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer.[6] Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice in the days before the official announcement.[47] On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.[48]\n\n\nThe response to the appointment in New York was mixed. Upstate New York media was generally optimistic about the appointment of an upstate senator,[49] as none had been elected since Charles Goodell left office in 1971.[50] Many downstaters were disappointed with the selection, with some media outlets stating that Paterson had ignored the electoral influence of New York City and downstate on state politics. One questioned whether Paterson's administration was aware of \"[where] statewide elections are won and lost\".[49] Gillibrand was relatively unknown statewide, and many voters found the choice surprising.[12] One source stated, \"With every Democrat in New York ... angling for the appointment, there was a sense of bafflement, belittlement, and bruised egos when Paterson tapped the junior legislator unknown outside of Albany.\"[6]\n\n\nShortly before her appointment to the Senate was announced, Gillibrand reportedly contacted the Empire State Pride Agenda, an LGBT lobbying organization in New York, to express her full support for same-sex marriage, the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy regarding gay and lesbian servicemembers, and the passage of legislation banning discrimination against transgender persons.[51][52] She had supported civil unions for same-sex couples[52] and argued that the same-sex marriage issue should be left to states.[40] Paterson's office had advised her to reach out to Empire State Pride.[53][52]\n\n\nGillibrand was sworn in on January 26, 2009; at 42, she entered the chamber as the youngest senator in the 111th Congress.[6] In February, she endorsed Scott Murphy, whom New York Democrats chose as their nominee for her former seat in the House of Representatives.[54] In April, Murphy won the seat against Republican Jim Tedisco by 399 votes and succeeded Gillibrand in the House until 2011.[55]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand is sworn in for her second term by Vice President Biden (2011)\nMain article: 2010 United States Senate special election in New York\n\nGillibrand had numerous potential challengers in the September 14, 2010, Democratic primary election. Some were obvious at the time of her appointment. Most notably, Representative Carolyn McCarthy was unhappy with Gillibrand's stance on gun control,[56][Note 2] but McCarthy decided not to run.[57] Harold Ford, Jr., a former Congressman from Tennessee, considered a run but decided against it in March 2009.[58]\n\n\nConcerned about a possible schism in the party that could lead to a heated primary, split electorate, and weakened stance, high-ranking members of the party backed Gillibrand and requested major opponents not to run.[58] In the end, Gillibrand faced Gail Goode, a lawyer from New York City,[59] and won the primary with 76% of the vote.[60]\n\n\nDespite what was expected to be a heated race, Gillibrand easily prevailed against former Republican congressman Joseph DioGuardi in her first statewide election.[61] By the end of October, a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showed Gillibrand leading 57%-34%.[62] Gillibrand won the November election 63%–35%, carrying 54 of New York's 62 counties; the counties that supported DioGuardi did so by a margin no greater than 10%.[61]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in New York\n\nGillibrand's special election victory gave her the right to serve the rest of Clinton's second term, which ended in January 2013. Gillibrand ran for a full six-year term in November 2012. In the general election, she faced Wendy E. Long, an attorney running on both the Republican Party and Conservative Party lines.[63][64] Gillibrand was endorsed by *The New York Times*[65] and the *Democrat and Chronicle*.[66] She won the election with 72.2% of the vote;[67] in so doing, she surpassed Schumer's 71.2% victory in 2004 and achieved the largest victory margin for a statewide candidate in New York history. She carried all counties except for two in western New York.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in New York\n\nGillibrand was reelected to a second term in the Senate, defeating Republican Chele Chiavacci Farley[69] with 67% of the vote.[70] During a campaign debate, she pledged that she would serve out a full six-year term if reelected.[71] She was endorsed by the progressive groups Indivisible[72][73] and Working Families.[74][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Senate tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand (2010)\nA member of the Democratic Party's relatively conservative Blue Dog faction while in the House, Gillibrand has moved her political positions and ideology toward a liberal, progressive position since her appointment to the Senate.[75][76] In both cases, her views were significantly defined by the respective constituencies she served[77]—a conservative congressional district versus the generally liberal state of New York, especially as defined by New York City. For example, although she had been quiet on the U.S. military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy when she was in the House, during her first 18 months in the Senate, Gillibrand was an important part of the successful campaign to repeal it.[78]\n\n\nGillibrand made national headlines in February 2009 for stating that she and her husband kept two guns under their bed.[79][80][81] Her staff later indicated that Gillibrand no longer stored guns under her bed.[82]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2009, a combined Schumer–Gillibrand press release said that the two strongly supported a Latino being nominated to the Supreme Court at the time of the next vacancy. Their first choice was Sonia Sotomayor.[83] The two introduced her at Sotomayor's Senate confirmation hearing in July 2009.[84]\n\n\nDuring the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, Gillibrand scored two substantial legislative victories: the passage of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Both were issues she had advocated for during that session. In the aftermath of these victories, Gillibrand gained a more prominent national profile.[85][86][87]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Gillibrand co-sponsored the PROTECT IP Act, which would restrict access to websites judged to be infringing copyrights,[88] but ultimately announced she would not support the bill as-is due to wide critical public response.[89]\n\n\nIn 2012, Gillibrand authored a portion of the STOCK Act, which extended limitations on insider trading by members of Congress. A version of the bill, merged by Senator Joe Lieberman with content from another bill authored by Senator Scott Brown,[90] was passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama in April.[91]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gillibrand proposed legislation that would remove sexual assault cases from the military chain of command; the bill was cosponsored by Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz.[92] Gillibrand's bill failed to gain enough votes to break a filibuster in March 2014, but her efforts likely improved her standing as a lawmaker in the Senate.[93]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Gillibrand introduced the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would have provided paid family leave.[94]\n\n\nBy 2013, Gillibrand had \"skillfully aligned herself with causes with visible, moving human characters who have helped amplified her policy goals\".[95] For example, in campaigning for the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, she established a website with videos of gay and lesbian veterans telling their personal stories.[95] She has been less deferential to Senate seniority protocols and more uncompromising in her positions—such as combating sexual assault in the military—than most freshman senators, which has sometimes caused friction with her Democratic colleagues. Senator Charles Grassley has contrasted her approach with other New Yorkers of both parties, saying she is distinguished by \"her determination and knowledge and willingness to sit down one on one with senators and explain what she is up to\". Her fund-raising ability—almost $30 million from 2009 through 2013—helped her become a mentor to female candidates nationwide during that period.[95]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand speaking at a White House summit (2014)\nIn 2014, Gillibrand was included in the annual *Time* 100, *Time* magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[96]\n\n\nIn 2015, Gillibrand invited campus activist Emma Sulkowicz to attend the State of the Union Address. Her invitation was intended to promote the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, a bill Gillibrand co-sponsored.[97]\n\n\nGillibrand once supported legislation that would criminalize \"boycotts\" by individuals or groups seeking to express a disapproval of the actions taken by the government of Israel.[98] Gillibrand's advocacy against protests and \"boycotts\" included her co-sponsoring S.720, coined the \"Israel Anti-Boycott Act\". This legislation would have criminalized any political boycott intended to protest actions by the Israeli government, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.[98][99][100] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) denounced S.720, claiming its provisions seeking to \"punish U.S. persons based solely on their expressed political beliefs\" are \"inconsistent\" with First Amendment constitutional protections.[101] In July 2017, Gillibrand stated that she no longer supported the bill in its then-current form, adding that she would advocate for changes to it. She said the bill did not \"have any relevance to individuals at all\" and insisted she planned to \"urge them to rewrite it to make sure it says...'This is only applying to companies.'\"[102]\n\n\nIn a February 2018 *60 Minutes* profile, Gillibrand said she was \"'embarrassed and ashamed'\" of the positions on immigration and guns she held during her tenure in the House of Representatives.[103]\n\n\nGillibrand was named as part of the \"Hell-No Caucus\" by *Politico* in 2018, along with Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders, for voting \"overwhelmingly to thwart [Trump's] nominees for administration jobs\", such as with Rex Tillerson, Betsy DeVos, and Mike Pompeo; all the senators were considered potential 2020 presidential contenders at the time,[104] and all five did run for president in 2020.\n\n\nAccording to a FiveThirtyEight study, 12% of Gillibrand's votes matched Trump's position, the lowest among all senators.[105]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### Current[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Marketing and Agriculture Security (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy, Science and Technology\n\t+ Subcommittee on Hunger, Nutrition and Family Farms\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Personnel\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Strategic Forces\n* Special Committee on Aging\n* Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n\n#### Previous[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works (2009-2021)\n* Committee on Foreign Relations (2009-2011)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Healthy Kids Caucus\n* International Conservation Caucus\n* Senate Women's Caucus\n* Sportsmen's Caucus\n* Afterschool Caucuses[106]\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Gillibrand 2020 |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Campaign | 2020 United States presidential election (Democratic Party primaries) |\n| Candidate | **Kirsten Gillibrand**Senator from New York (2009–)Member of the House from New York (2007–2009) |\n| EC formed | January 15, 2019 |\n| Launched | March 17, 2019 |\n| Suspended | August 28, 2019 |\n| Headquarters | Troy, New York[107] |\n| Key people | Jess Fassler (campaign manager)[108] |\n| Receipts | US$15,919,261.11[109] (September 30, 2019) |\n| Slogan | Brave Wins |\n\n\n### Exploratory committee[edit]\n\n\nIn early 2019, on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, Gillibrand announced the formation of an exploratory committee to consider running for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] During her January 15 appearance, she said, \"I am going to run\",[111] and the same day paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission established the Gillibrand 2020 Exploratory Committee.[112] Gillibrand had frequently been mentioned as a possible 2020 contender by the media before her announcement,[113][114] but during a 2018 Senate campaign debate, she had promised to serve her entire six-year term if she were reelected.[71]\n\n\n\n### Campaign announcement and suspension[edit]\n\n\nIn a Twitter post on March 17, Gillibrand announced that she was officially running for president.[115][116] Like other Democratic candidates, she pledged not to accept campaign donations from political action committees.[117]\n\n\nGillibrand was invited to the first Democratic presidential debate, participating on the second night, on June 27. She was also invited to the second debate, again participating in the second night, on July 31.[118]\n\n\nGillibrand suspended her campaign on August 28, 2019, citing her failure to qualify for the third round of Democratic primary debates.[119][120] She neither met the polling threshold nor sustained the fundraising quota set as debate qualifications.[119]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand speaking to the California Democratic Party State Convention in June 2019.\nMain article: Endorsements in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries § Kirsten Gillibrand\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Kirsten Gillibrand\n\nDuring her tenure in the House of Representatives, Gillibrand was known as a centrist Democrat.[121][122] In the House, she was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition,[123][124] a caucus of fiscally conservative Democrats;[125] she also voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008,[29][36] spoke against the issuance of driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, and voted for a bill that would withhold federal funds from immigrant sanctuary cities.[37][38] Gillibrand also voted for a bill that limited information-sharing between federal agencies about firearm purchasers[7] and advocated for civil unions for same-sex couples.[40]\n\n\nSince she became a member of the Senate, Gillibrand's political positions have moved leftward.[126][40] In July 2018, *Newsday* wrote that Gillibrand \"formerly held more conservative views on guns and immigration, but, in her nine years as New York's junior senator, [has] swung steadily to the left on those and other issues\".[127] After being appointed to the Senate, she expressed support for same-sex marriage.[51][53] A supporter of gun rights while in the House, Gillibrand has since moved in the direction of gun control.[128][121] She has said that a conversation with a family who had lost a daughter to gun violence made her realize that she was \"wrong\" to oppose gun control measures; having once received an \"A\" rating from the NRA, she received an \"F\" rating as of 2018.[121][127] In June 2018, Gillibrand called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, a \"deportation force\" and became the first sitting senator to support the call to abolish ICE. She said, \"I believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works\" and \"I think you should reimagine ICE under a new agency with a very different mission\".[127][129][130][131]\n\n\nIn May 2018, *City & State* reported that Gillibrand had \"moved sharply leftward on economic issues, embracing a number of proposals to expand the social safety net and bolster lower-income families\".[132] In July 2018, *The New York Times* wrote that Gillibrand had \"spent recent months injecting her portfolio with a dose of the kind of economic populism that infused Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign in the 2016 presidential primary\".[133]\n\n\nIn a 2019 reversal of a past position, Gillibrand stated her support for driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.[134]\n\n\nOn social issues, Gillibrand is generally liberal, supporting abortion rights[135] and helping lead the successful repeal effort of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\".[121] A supporter of Medicare-for-all since her first House run in 2006,[133] she co-sponsored a 2017 Medicare-for-all bill introduced by Sanders and said that health care should be a right.[136] Gillibrand also supports a federal jobs guarantee. Although she used to be one of the top recipients of corporate campaign donations, in 2018 she supported rejecting corporate PAC funds and invested heavily in online fundraising. Ninety-seven percent of donations to her 2018 campaign totaled $100 or less.[133] She advocates government transparency, being one of a few members of Congress who release much personal and scheduling information.[137]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Gillibrand co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment, for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[99][138] In July 2017, Gillibrand said she no longer supported the bill in its then-current form, adding that she would advocate for changes to it. She said the bill did not \"have any relevance to individuals at all\" and insisted she planned to \"urge them to rewrite it to make sure it says...'This is only applying to companies.'\"[102]\n\n\nIn 2018, Gillibrand said she was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" of the positions on guns and immigration she took during her House tenure.[103]\n\n\n\n### #MeToo movement[edit]\n\n\nGillibrand has gone against her party on a number of occasions on issues related to women's rights.[121] Declaring a \"zero tolerance\" doctrine regarding accusations of sexual misconduct by members of Congress, Gillibrand was the first in her caucus to call on Senator Al Franken to resign.[139] Franken left office before a Senate Ethics Committee investigation could review the accuracy of the allegations against him.[140][141] In 2019, seven Democratic current and former U.S. senators who had demanded Franken's resignation in 2017 told *New Yorker* reporter Jane Mayer they had been wrong to do so, but Gillibrand has expressed no regrets for leading the demand for his resignation.[142]\nIn November 2017, amid the MeToo movement, Gillibrand became the first high-profile Democrat to say that Bill Clinton should have resigned when his affair with Monica Lewinsky was revealed.[121][143] In 2018, Clinton expressed disagreement with Gillibrand's opinion.[144]\n\n\nIn 2019, a female former aide to Gillibrand criticized her for retaining a male staffer despite the aide's sexual harassment complaint against him.[145]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gillibrand with her husband and sons on Halloween, 2009\n![](image)Gillibrand is joined by her husband and her son Henry during a presidential campaign appearance at the Iowa State Fair\nGillibrand met her husband, Jonathan Gillibrand, a venture capitalist and British national, on a blind date. Jonathan planned to be in the United States for only a year while studying for his Master of Business Administration at Columbia University, but he stayed in the country because of their developing relationship. They married in a Catholic church in Manhattan in 2001.[4][6]\n\n\nThe Gillibrands had their first son, Theodore, in 2003,[7] and their second son, Henry, in 2008. Gillibrand continued to work until the day of Henry's delivery and received a standing ovation from her colleagues in the House for doing so.[7]\n\n\nBecause of the requirements of Gillibrand's office, the family spends most of its time in Washington, D.C.[7][146] In 2011, the Gillibrands sold their house in Hudson and purchased their home in Brunswick to be closer to Gillibrand's family in Albany.[147] In 2020, the Gillibrands sold their house in Brunswick.[148] Gillibrand stated in 2020 that her family was looking for a house in the North Country.[149]\n\n\nGillibrand was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership honor society, as an *honoris causa* initiate at SUNY Plattsburgh in 2012.[150]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Gillibrand published her first book, *Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World*.[151] The candid memoir was notable in the media upon release due to whisperings of a future presidential run[152] as well as Gillibrand's claims of sexism in the Senate,[153] including specific comments made to her by other members of Congress about her weight and appearance.[154] *Off the Sidelines* debuted at number 8 on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction.[155]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nNew York 20th congressional district election, 2006[26]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 116,416\n |  |  |\n|  | Working Families | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 3,839\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** | 125,168\n | 53.10\n |  |\n|  | Republican | John Sweeney\n | 94,093\n |  |  |\n|  | Conservative | John Sweeney\n | 9,869\n |  |  |\n|  | Independence | John Sweeney\n | 6,592\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | John Sweeney | 110,554\n | 46.90\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 14,614\n |  |  |\n| Turnout | 235,722\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2008 New York's 20th congressional district election[156]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 178,996\n |  |  |\n|  | Working Families | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 14,655\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** | 193,651\n | 62.13\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Sandy Treadwell\n | 99,930\n |  |  |\n|  | Conservative | Sandy Treadwell\n | 10,077\n |  |  |\n|  | Independence | Sandy Treadwell\n | 8,024\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | Sandy Treadwell | 118,031\n | 37.87\n |  |\n| Majority\n | 75,620\n |  |  |\n| Turnout | 311,682\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n.9\n\n\n\n2010 U.S. Senate Democratic primary in New York[157]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Kirsten Gillibrand (Incumbent)**  | **464,512**  | **76.1%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Gail Goode\n | 145,491\n | 23.9%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **610,003**  | **100.00%**  |\n\n\n\n\n2010 U.S. Senate election in New York[158]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic | Kirsten Gillibrand (Incumbent)\n | 2,479,310\n |  |  |\n|  | Working Families | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 182,648\n |  |  |\n|  | Independence | Kirsten Gillibrand\n | 175,631\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** **(Incumbent)** | **2,837,589** | **62.95%** |  |\n|  | Republican | Joe DioGuardi\n | 1,338,239\n |  |  |\n|  | Conservative | Joe DioGuardi\n | 244,364\n |  |  |\n|  | Total\n | Joe DioGuardi | 1,582,603\n | 35.11%\n |  |\n|  | Green | Cecile A.

A member of the Democratic Party, Hassan was the 81st governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017.[3]\n\n\nBorn in Boston, Hassan graduated from Brown University and earned a J.D. from the Northeastern University School of Law. After graduating from law school in 1985, she worked at the law firm Palmer & Dodge. She later worked as associate general counsel for Brigham and Women’s Hospital.[4]\n\n\nHassan first ran for the New Hampshire Senate in 2002 after Democratic Party leaders recruited her.[5][6] She lost to incumbent Russell Prescott but ran against Prescott again in 2004 and won.[7][8] Hassan was elected to a total of three two-year terms, representing New Hampshire's 23rd district from January 2005 to December 2010. She became the State Senate majority leader in 2008 before losing reelection in a 2010 rematch with Prescott.[9]\n\n\nHassan declared her candidacy for governor in October 2011. She defeated former state senator Jacalyn Cilley in the Democratic primary and faced the Republican nominee, attorney Ovide M. Lamontagne, in the general election. Hassan won with 55% of the vote, becoming the state's second female governor. She was reelected in 2014. After becoming governor, Hassan was elected vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association and served as a superdelegate at the Democratic National Convention.[6]\n\n\nIn 2016, Hassan ran for the U.S. Senate and narrowly defeated Kelly Ayotte, the Republican incumbent, by about a thousand votes (about 0.1% of the vote).[10][11] She was reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Don Bolduc. She is serving with Jeanne Shaheen, another former governor. Hassan and Shaheen are the only two women in American history to be elected both governor and U.S. senator.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHassan was born Margaret Wood in Boston, Massachusetts,[13] the daughter of Margaret (Byers) and Robert Coldwell Wood, a political scientist who served as U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Lyndon Johnson administration. She has two siblings, including Tony award-winning actor Frank Wood.[14][15][16]\n\n\nShe grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts.[16] As a child she sang in school choirs and at church.[16] Her parents were politically active and she collated mailers for the League of Women Voters.[16] She attended Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, Sudbury, Massachusetts, and graduated with the Class of 1976. Wood then enrolled at Brown University, where she majored in history and graduated in 1980 with a B.A. degree. While there, she met her future husband, Thomas Hassan, also a student at the university.[5] She received a J.D. degree from the Northeastern University School of Law in 1985.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1999, Hassan worked as an attorney.[17] From 1985 to 1992,[*citation needed*] she worked at the Boston law firm Palmer & Dodge.[19] From 1993 to 1996, Hassan was associate general counsel for Brigham and Women's Hospital.[20]\n\n\nIn 1996, Hassan began working as an attorney for Sullivan, Weinstein & McQuay, a Boston corporate defense and business law firm.[21] In 1999, then-New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen appointed her as a citizen advisor to the Advisory Committee to the Adequacy in Education and Finance Commission.[17]\n\n\n\n## New Hampshire Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hassan speaking in April 2007.\nHassan first ran for the New Hampshire Senate in 2002 after Democratic Party leaders suggested she run.[5] She lost to incumbent Russell Prescott, 54% to 46%.[7] In 2004, she ran against Prescott again and won, 52% to 48%.[22] In 2006, she was reelected against Natalie Healy, 60% to 40%.[8] In 2008, she defeated Lee Quandt, 57% to 43%.[23] She served as the assistant Democratic whip, president pro tempore, and majority leader of the State Senate during her six years in office. She represented New Hampshire's 23rd district, which includes East Kingston, Exeter, Kensington, Kingston, Newfields, Newmarket, Newton, Seabrook, South Hampton and Stratham.\n\n\nIn November 2010, Hassan lost to Prescott in a second rematch, 53% to 47%,[24] as Republicans regained control of both the state House and state Senate.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nHassan served on the Capital Budget Committee and the Budget Conference Committee.[26] She helped pass the FY2008-09 budget.[27]\n\n\nIn 2008, Senate President Sylvia Larsen chose Hassan to serve as Senate Majority Leader, the number two position in the New Hampshire Senate. Larsen chose her for the position because she wanted someone who would fight to get the Democratic caucus to support the same agenda, at times creating friction between Hassan and her Republican colleagues.[28]\n\n\nDuring her tenure as majority leader, Hassan had a major role in legalizing same-sex marriage in New Hampshire.[28] She presented three versions of a same-sex marriage bill, one of which narrowly gained enough support to pass both chambers.[28]\n\n\nHassan helped pass the FY2010-11 budget.[29] This budget increased spending by over $1 billion and contained 33 tax and fee increases, including taxing campsites like hotel rooms, a so-called \"income tax\" on New Hampshire business, and raising vehicle registration fees.[30][31][32]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Capital Budget Committee\n* Commerce, Labor and Consumer Protection\n* Finance\n* Public and Municipal Affairs (Chair)\n* Energy, Environment, and Economic Development (Vice Chair)\n* Internal Affairs Committee\n* Executive Department and Administration Committee\n\n\n## Governor of New Hampshire[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 New Hampshire gubernatorial election\n\n![](image)Hassan's official portrait as Governor of New Hampshire\nIn October 2011, Hassan announced her candidacy for governor of New Hampshire.[33] She won the Democratic primary with 53% of the vote, defeating former state senator Jacalyn Cilley, who received 39%.[34] Hassan was endorsed by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.[35][9] Campaign themes included implementing the Affordable Care Act.[36]\n\n\nIn the general election, Hassan defeated Republican nominee Ovide M. Lamontagne, 55% to 43%, carrying every county in the state.[37] Matt Burgess managed her campaign and senior consultants included media consultant Joe Slade White.[38]\n\n\nIndependent expenditure groups spent more than $11 million on Hassan's behalf. Major financial support for her campaign came from the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governor's Association, the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the National Education Association.[39]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 New Hampshire gubernatorial election\n\n![](image)A campaign sign for Hassan in 2014.\nIn June 2014, Hassan filed to run for reelection.[40] In August 2014, New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster, a Hassan appointee, ordered her to return $24,000 in campaign contributions that violated New Hampshire campaign finance laws.[41] In October 2014, Hassan was ordered to return another $25,000 in funds a union donated to her gubernatorial campaign because the union had not properly registered with the state as a political committee.[42]\n\n\nHassan defeated Ian Freeman in the September 9 Democratic primary and Republican nominee Walt Havenstein in the general election, 52% to 48%. She carried 7 of 10 counties.[43]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nHassan was sworn in as governor for a two-year term on January 3, 2013. In December 2013, she was elected vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association.[44] That year, Hassan signed a bill creating a state sea level rise commission.[45][46]\n\n\nDuring a conflict between two sides of the Demoulas family, which owns the Market Basket grocery chain, Hassan urged the family to resolve the dispute, which threatened 9,000 jobs in New Hampshire.[47]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Hassan vetoed a bill that would have removed the licensing requirement for carrying concealed firearms.[48] In response to New Hampshire's opioid crisis, she appointed Jack Wozmak the state's \"drug czar\" in early 2015. He resigned one year later in response to complaints about his job performance.[49][50] Hassan also worked to preserve funding for Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the state.[51]\n\n\nHassan resigned as governor on January 2, 2017, to prepare for her swearing-in to the U.S. Senate. Senate president Chuck Morse became acting governor.[52]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\n![](image)Hassan campaigning at a Hillary Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016.\nOn October 5, 2015, Hassan announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2016. She challenged Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte.[53] The race was considered one of the most competitive U.S. Senate races of the year.[54]\n\n\nHassan was endorsed by the pro-choice Democratic political action committee EMILY's List, which also backed her two gubernatorial runs.[55] Hassan endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.[56] She said climate change and reproductive rights would be her top priorities if she were elected to the Senate.[57]\n\n\nOn November 9, the day after Election Day, Hassan was declared the winner.[58] Ayotte conceded that evening, choosing not to pursue a recount.[58]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nHassan was reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Don Bolduc.[59]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hassan being sworn in to the U.S. Senate by Vice President Joe Biden.\n#### 116th Congress (2019–2021)[edit]\n\n\nHassan participated in a bipartisan Trump administration task force to support the reopening of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic[60]\n\n\nHassan was in the Senate chamber on January 6, 2021, for the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.[61] After the Capitol was breached by rioters, Hassan, along with staff and other senators, was removed from the chambers to an undisclosed location.[62] Hassan called the event traumatizing, calling it an \"insurrection\" and \"one of the grimmest days in the history of our country.\"[62][63] The following day, she called for Trump to resign, calling him \"unfit for office\".[63] She also called for an investigation into the lack of security, poor law enforcement response,[63] and how law enforcement treated the Trump supporters, which contrasted with the treatment of Black Lives Matter protestors.[62]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Finance\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight (Chair)[64]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management\n\t+ Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management\n* Committee on Veterans Affairs\n* Joint Economic Committee[65]\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2018, a congressional intern was caught on video yelling, \"Mr. President, fuck you!\", as Trump walked through the United States Capitol for a meeting with Republican representatives.[66] On June 25, Hassan's office confirmed that a Hassan intern, Caitlin Marriott, was the person caught on video swearing at Trump. A Hassan spokesperson confirmed that Marriott had been suspended from her position for a week and was required to return her congressional intern ID badge.[67] Hassan rejected demands that she fire Marriott.[68]\n\n\nIn 2019, former Hassan staffers Jackson Cosko and Samantha Davis pleaded guilty to federal crimes. Cosko pleaded guilty to five felonies; following his termination from Hassan's staff, he illegally accessed Senate computers, obtained personal information about five Republican senators, and disseminated that personal information online because he was angry about the senators' roles in the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. In June 2019, Cosko was sentenced to four years in prison.[69] Davis pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in July 2019, acknowledging that she had given Cosko access to Hassan's Senate office after he was fired and had lied to investigators about it.[70]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hassan speaking with Catherine Cortez Masto at a Senate committee hearing in June 2017.\nAs of September 2021, Hassan had voted in line with President Joe Biden's stated position 100% of the time.[71]\n\n\n\n### Firearms[edit]\n\n\nThe *National Review* reported that Hassan has a \"D\" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA) in 2012.[72][73] She supports a background check system to avoid gun sales to the mentally ill.[74] She was supported by Gabby Giffords and Michael Bloomberg in the 2016 election.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Hassan was one of ten senators to sign a letter to Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Lamar Alexander and ranking Democrat Patty Murray requesting they schedule a hearing on the causes and remedies of mass shootings in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[76]\n\n\n\n### Journalism[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Hassan cosponsored the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a new memorial that would be privately funded and constructed on federal lands within Washington, D.C. to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters who have died in the line of duty.[77]\n\n\n\n### Marijuana[edit]\n\n\nAs governor, Hassan signed legislation to legalize medical cannabis but said she would veto any bill that came to her desk to legalize recreational cannabis.[78] As of 2020, NORML, an organization that seeks legalization, gave Hassan a C- score as a U.S. senator due to her actions as governor.[79]\n\n\n\n### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nOn February 3, 2021, Hassan announced she opposes raising the federal minimum wage to $15/hour as proposed in President Biden's American Rescue Plan legislation.[80] On March 5, 2021, she and seven other Democratic senators voted with Republicans to block raising the minimum wage as part of the legislation.[81][82]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHassan's husband, Thomas, was principal of Phillips Exeter Academy from 2008 to 2015, and as of 2016 is the president of School Year Abroad.[83] When he was principal, the Hassans did not live in the Governor's Mansion, instead living in a colonial mansion on the school campus provided to them as part of her husband's employment.[5] In 2016, The Association of Boarding Schools censured Thomas Hassan for failing to disclose a former teacher's sexual misconduct at Phillips Exeter.[84] After he left his position at Phillips Exeter, the Hassans bought and moved into a home in Newfields, New Hampshire.[a][5][85]\n\n\nHassan has two adult children, the older of whom has cerebral palsy.[13] She is a member of the United Church of Christ.[86]\n\n\nHassan has received honorary doctorates from the University of New Hampshire (2013),[87] Northeastern University (2013),[88] Southern New Hampshire University (2014),[89] New Hampshire Institute of Art (2015),[90] New England College (2016),[91] and UNH School of Law (2017).[92]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### State

A member of the Democratic Party, Hassan was the 81st governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017.[3]\n\n\nBorn in Boston, Hassan graduated from Brown University and earned a J.D. from the Northeastern University School of Law. After graduating from law school in 1985, she worked at the law firm Palmer & Dodge. She later worked as associate general counsel for Brigham and Women’s Hospital.[4]\n\n\nHassan first ran for the New Hampshire Senate in 2002 after Democratic Party leaders recruited her.[5][6] She lost to incumbent Russell Prescott but ran against Prescott again in 2004 and won.[7][8] Hassan was elected to a total of three two-year terms, representing New Hampshire's 23rd district from January 2005 to December 2010. She became the State Senate majority leader in 2008 before losing reelection in a 2010 rematch with Prescott.[9]\n\n\nHassan declared her candidacy for governor in October 2011. She defeated former state senator Jacalyn Cilley in the Democratic primary and faced the Republican nominee, attorney Ovide M. Lamontagne, in the general election. Hassan won with 55% of the vote, becoming the state's second female governor. She was reelected in 2014. After becoming governor, Hassan was elected vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association and served as a superdelegate at the Democratic National Convention.[6]\n\n\nIn 2016, Hassan ran for the U.S. Senate and narrowly defeated Kelly Ayotte, the Republican incumbent, by about a thousand votes (about 0.1% of the vote).[10][11] She was reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Don Bolduc. She is serving with Jeanne Shaheen, another former governor. Hassan and Shaheen are the only two women in American history to be elected both governor and U.S. senator.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHassan was born Margaret Wood in Boston, Massachusetts,[13] the daughter of Margaret (Byers) and Robert Coldwell Wood, a political scientist who served as U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Lyndon Johnson administration. She has two siblings, including Tony award-winning actor Frank Wood.[14][15][16]\n\n\nShe grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts.[16] As a child she sang in school choirs and at church.[16] Her parents were politically active and she collated mailers for the League of Women Voters.[16] She attended Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School, Sudbury, Massachusetts, and graduated with the Class of 1976. Wood then enrolled at Brown University, where she majored in history and graduated in 1980 with a B.A. degree. While there, she met her future husband, Thomas Hassan, also a student at the university.[5] She received a J.D. degree from the Northeastern University School of Law in 1985.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1999, Hassan worked as an attorney.[17] From 1985 to 1992,[*citation needed*] she worked at the Boston law firm Palmer & Dodge.[19] From 1993 to 1996, Hassan was associate general counsel for Brigham and Women's Hospital.[20]\n\n\nIn 1996, Hassan began working as an attorney for Sullivan, Weinstein & McQuay, a Boston corporate defense and business law firm.[21] In 1999, then-New Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen appointed her as a citizen advisor to the Advisory Committee to the Adequacy in Education and Finance Commission.[17]\n\n\n\n## New Hampshire Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hassan speaking in April 2007.\nHassan first ran for the New Hampshire Senate in 2002 after Democratic Party leaders suggested she run.[5] She lost to incumbent Russell Prescott, 54% to 46%.[7] In 2004, she ran against Prescott again and won, 52% to 48%.[22] In 2006, she was reelected against Natalie Healy, 60% to 40%.[8] In 2008, she defeated Lee Quandt, 57% to 43%.[23] She served as the assistant Democratic whip, president pro tempore, and majority leader of the State Senate during her six years in office. She represented New Hampshire's 23rd district, which includes East Kingston, Exeter, Kensington, Kingston, Newfields, Newmarket, Newton, Seabrook, South Hampton and Stratham.\n\n\nIn November 2010, Hassan lost to Prescott in a second rematch, 53% to 47%,[24] as Republicans regained control of both the state House and state Senate.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nHassan served on the Capital Budget Committee and the Budget Conference Committee.[26] She helped pass the FY2008-09 budget.[27]\n\n\nIn 2008, Senate President Sylvia Larsen chose Hassan to serve as Senate Majority Leader, the number two position in the New Hampshire Senate. Larsen chose her for the position because she wanted someone who would fight to get the Democratic caucus to support the same agenda, at times creating friction between Hassan and her Republican colleagues.[28]\n\n\nDuring her tenure as majority leader, Hassan had a major role in legalizing same-sex marriage in New Hampshire.[28] She presented three versions of a same-sex marriage bill, one of which narrowly gained enough support to pass both chambers.[28]\n\n\nHassan helped pass the FY2010-11 budget.[29] This budget increased spending by over $1 billion and contained 33 tax and fee increases, including taxing campsites like hotel rooms, a so-called \"income tax\" on New Hampshire business, and raising vehicle registration fees.[30][31][32]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Capital Budget Committee\n* Commerce, Labor and Consumer Protection\n* Finance\n* Public and Municipal Affairs (Chair)\n* Energy, Environment, and Economic Development (Vice Chair)\n* Internal Affairs Committee\n* Executive Department and Administration Committee\n\n\n## Governor of New Hampshire[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 New Hampshire gubernatorial election\n\n![](image)Hassan's official portrait as Governor of New Hampshire\nIn October 2011, Hassan announced her candidacy for governor of New Hampshire.[33] She won the Democratic primary with 53% of the vote, defeating former state senator Jacalyn Cilley, who received 39%.[34] Hassan was endorsed by former U.S. President Bill Clinton.[35][9] Campaign themes included implementing the Affordable Care Act.[36]\n\n\nIn the general election, Hassan defeated Republican nominee Ovide M. Lamontagne, 55% to 43%, carrying every county in the state.[37] Matt Burgess managed her campaign and senior consultants included media consultant Joe Slade White.[38]\n\n\nIndependent expenditure groups spent more than $11 million on Hassan's behalf. Major financial support for her campaign came from the Washington, D.C.-based Democratic Governor's Association, the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the National Education Association.[39]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 New Hampshire gubernatorial election\n\n![](image)A campaign sign for Hassan in 2014.\nIn June 2014, Hassan filed to run for reelection.[40] In August 2014, New Hampshire Attorney General Joseph Foster, a Hassan appointee, ordered her to return $24,000 in campaign contributions that violated New Hampshire campaign finance laws.[41] In October 2014, Hassan was ordered to return another $25,000 in funds a union donated to her gubernatorial campaign because the union had not properly registered with the state as a political committee.[42]\n\n\nHassan defeated Ian Freeman in the September 9 Democratic primary and Republican nominee Walt Havenstein in the general election, 52% to 48%. She carried 7 of 10 counties.[43]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nHassan was sworn in as governor for a two-year term on January 3, 2013. In December 2013, she was elected vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association.[44] That year, Hassan signed a bill creating a state sea level rise commission.[45][46]\n\n\nDuring a conflict between two sides of the Demoulas family, which owns the Market Basket grocery chain, Hassan urged the family to resolve the dispute, which threatened 9,000 jobs in New Hampshire.[47]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Hassan vetoed a bill that would have removed the licensing requirement for carrying concealed firearms.[48] In response to New Hampshire's opioid crisis, she appointed Jack Wozmak the state's \"drug czar\" in early 2015. He resigned one year later in response to complaints about his job performance.[49][50] Hassan also worked to preserve funding for Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the state.[51]\n\n\nHassan resigned as governor on January 2, 2017, to prepare for her swearing-in to the U.S. Senate. Senate president Chuck Morse became acting governor.[52]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\n![](image)Hassan campaigning at a Hillary Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 2016.\nOn October 5, 2015, Hassan announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2016. She challenged Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte.[53] The race was considered one of the most competitive U.S. Senate races of the year.[54]\n\n\nHassan was endorsed by the pro-choice Democratic political action committee EMILY's List, which also backed her two gubernatorial runs.[55] Hassan endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.[56] She said climate change and reproductive rights would be her top priorities if she were elected to the Senate.[57]\n\n\nOn November 9, the day after Election Day, Hassan was declared the winner.[58] Ayotte conceded that evening, choosing not to pursue a recount.[58]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nHassan was reelected in 2022, defeating Republican nominee Don Bolduc.[59]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hassan being sworn in to the U.S. Senate by Vice President Joe Biden.\n#### 116th Congress (2019–2021)[edit]\n\n\nHassan participated in a bipartisan Trump administration task force to support the reopening of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic[60]\n\n\nHassan was in the Senate chamber on January 6, 2021, for the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.[61] After the Capitol was breached by rioters, Hassan, along with staff and other senators, was removed from the chambers to an undisclosed location.[62] Hassan called the event traumatizing, calling it an \"insurrection\" and \"one of the grimmest days in the history of our country.\"[62][63] The following day, she called for Trump to resign, calling him \"unfit for office\".[63] She also called for an investigation into the lack of security, poor law enforcement response,[63] and how law enforcement treated the Trump supporters, which contrasted with the treatment of Black Lives Matter protestors.[62]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Finance\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight (Chair)[64]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management\n\t+ Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management\n* Committee on Veterans Affairs\n* Joint Economic Committee[65]\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2018, a congressional intern was caught on video yelling, \"Mr. President, fuck you!\", as Trump walked through the United States Capitol for a meeting with Republican representatives.[66] On June 25, Hassan's office confirmed that a Hassan intern, Caitlin Marriott, was the person caught on video swearing at Trump. A Hassan spokesperson confirmed that Marriott had been suspended from her position for a week and was required to return her congressional intern ID badge.[67] Hassan rejected demands that she fire Marriott.[68]\n\n\nIn 2019, former Hassan staffers Jackson Cosko and Samantha Davis pleaded guilty to federal crimes. Cosko pleaded guilty to five felonies; following his termination from Hassan's staff, he illegally accessed Senate computers, obtained personal information about five Republican senators, and disseminated that personal information online because he was angry about the senators' roles in the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. In June 2019, Cosko was sentenced to four years in prison.[69] Davis pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors in July 2019, acknowledging that she had given Cosko access to Hassan's Senate office after he was fired and had lied to investigators about it.[70]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hassan speaking with Catherine Cortez Masto at a Senate committee hearing in June 2017.\nAs of September 2021, Hassan had voted in line with President Joe Biden's stated position 100% of the time.[71]\n\n\n\n### Firearms[edit]\n\n\nThe *National Review* reported that Hassan has a \"D\" rating from the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA) in 2012.[72][73] She supports a background check system to avoid gun sales to the mentally ill.[74] She was supported by Gabby Giffords and Michael Bloomberg in the 2016 election.[75]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Hassan was one of ten senators to sign a letter to Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Lamar Alexander and ranking Democrat Patty Murray requesting they schedule a hearing on the causes and remedies of mass shootings in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[76]\n\n\n\n### Journalism[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Hassan cosponsored the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a new memorial that would be privately funded and constructed on federal lands within Washington, D.C. to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters who have died in the line of duty.[77]\n\n\n\n### Marijuana[edit]\n\n\nAs governor, Hassan signed legislation to legalize medical cannabis but said she would veto any bill that came to her desk to legalize recreational cannabis.[78] As of 2020, NORML, an organization that seeks legalization, gave Hassan a C- score as a U.S. senator due to her actions as governor.[79]\n\n\n\n### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nOn February 3, 2021, Hassan announced she opposes raising the federal minimum wage to $15/hour as proposed in President Biden's American Rescue Plan legislation.[80] On March 5, 2021, she and seven other Democratic senators voted with Republicans to block

the president of School Year Abroad.[83] When he was principal, the Hassans did not live in the Governor's Mansion, instead living in a colonial mansion on the school campus provided to them as part of her husband's employment.[5] In 2016, The Association of Boarding Schools censured Thomas Hassan for failing to disclose a former teacher's sexual misconduct at Phillips Exeter.[84] After he left his position at Phillips Exeter, the Hassans bought and moved into a home in Newfields, New Hampshire.[a][5][85]\n\n\nHassan has two adult children, the older of whom has cerebral palsy.[13] She is a member of the United Church of Christ.[86]\n\n\nHassan has received honorary doctorates from the University of New Hampshire (2013),[87] Northeastern University (2013),[88] Southern New Hampshire University (2014),[89] New Hampshire Institute of Art (2015),[90] New England College (2016),[91] and UNH School of Law (2017).[92]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### State

A member of the Democratic Party, Hirono previously served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2007 to 2013. Hirono also served as a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1981 to 1995 and as Hawaii's tenth lieutenant governor from 1994 to 2002, under Ben Cayetano. She was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor of Hawaii in 2002, defeated by Republican Linda Lingle in the general election.\n\n\nHirono is the first elected female senator from Hawaii, the first Asian-American woman elected to the Senate, the first U.S. senator born in Japan, and the nation's first Buddhist senator. She considers herself a non-practicing Buddhist[1][2] and is often cited with Hank Johnson as the first Buddhist to serve in the United States Congress.[3] She is also the third woman to be elected to Congress from Hawaii (after Patsy Mink and Pat Saiki).\n\n\nIn 2012, Hirono was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Daniel Akaka. Hirono won the election, defeating Lingle in a landslide, 63% to 37%. She was sworn in on January 3, 2013, by Vice President Joe Biden. Hirono was the only person of Asian ancestry serving in the U.S. Senate from 2013 until 2017, when senators Tammy Duckworth and Kamala Harris were sworn in, representing Illinois and California, respectively. Although Brian Schatz is Hawaii's senior senator because he joined the Senate a week before Hirono, following the death of Daniel Inouye, Hirono's three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives make her the dean, or longest-serving member overall, of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMazie Hirono was born on November 3, 1947, in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan to Laura Chie Satō, a Japanese American, and Hirono Matabe, a Japanese veteran of World War II. Mazie's maternal grandfather, Hiroshi Satō, immigrated to Hawaii to work on a sugar plantation at the age of 16; her grandmother, Tari Shinoki, immigrated to Hawaii as a picture bride.[4] After finding plantation work difficult, the couple opened a bathhouse on River Street in Honolulu in 1928. The couple had a daughter, Laura Chie, in 1924, and a son, Akira.\n\n\nIn 1939, Tari returned to Japan with the teenaged Laura and Akira; Hiroshi remained in Hawaii to run the bathhouse for two more years before joining his family in 1941. Laura felt out of place in Japan as one of the many Nisei Japanese Americans who emigrated with their returning Issei parents (barred from US citizenship or land ownership) before World War II and during the Great Depression. But although her brother returned to Hawaii after the war, she remained in Japan and married a veterinarian, Hirono Matabe, in 1946. Laura moved with her husband to southern Fukushima, and had three children, Roy, Mazie, and Wayne. Mazie, the middle child, was the only surviving daughter.[5]\n\n\nMazie's father, Matabe, was a compulsive gambler and alcoholic who pawned even his wife's possessions for gambling money.[5] Treated \"like a slave\" by her in-laws,[5] Mazie's mother finally left the abusive marriage in 1951. Laura later recounted her point of decision: \"My brother sent money to buy a school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town and never came back home. It was getting closer to the start of school, so I went to look for him. I found out he had ordered an overcoat for himself with the money. He didn't need an overcoat in the spring. That's when I made up my mind to leave.\"[4] After telling her in-laws she was going to take her children to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return. Selling her clothes to pay the rail fare, she and the children moved back to her parents' home. Laura said, \"My husband never came around once; my parents were supportive and took all of us in. My mother gave us money. I guess it all boils down to love.\"\n\n\nThe Satō-Hirono family decided to return to Hawaii, but under the U.S. quota system Tari and Hiroshi, as Japanese nationals without American citizenship or professional status, could not go with Laura, an American citizen. Thus the family was separated, with three-year-old Wayne staying behind with his grandparents and Laura returning to Honolulu on her own with Mazie and Roy in March 1955. After two years of hard work, she brought her parents and youngest son to Hawaii in 1957.[4] \"She determined that she had to get away [from her husband]...she wanted to put thousands of miles between them\", Hirono said of her mother. \"That took a lot of courage. I always tell my mom there is nothing I can do—hard as it is to be in politics...harder than what she did.\"[4][5]\n\n\nAfter first living with Mazie's uncle Akira, the family moved into a rooming house on Kewalo Street in Honolulu with one room, one table, three chairs and one bed. Laura recalled, \"Mazie and Roy slept on the bed. I slept on the floor with a futon. The landlady was so nice. The rent was $35, but she charged us less because I didn't have a job.\"[4] Laura began working for the Hawaii Hochi as a typesetter and also three nights a week for a catering company. Mazie worked in the school cafeteria and had a paper route.[6] Though money was tight and the family was forced to move often, Laura kept them together. Mazie recalled that she and her brother used to get a dime once or twice a week from their mother. \"We both had baseball piggy banks. My older brother spent all his dimes but I saved mine. But one day I came home and the dimes were gone. My mother had to use it to buy food.\"\n\n\nHirono never saw her father again, and he has since died.[7] Laura became a newspaper proofreader in 1961 and retired from the Hawaii Newspaper Agency in 1986; Roy became a Hawaiian Electric supervisor. Wayne drowned in 1978, aged 26. Mazie's grandfather Hiroshi died in 1989, and her grandmother Tari died in 2000 at age 99.[4][8]\n\n\nRaised in Honolulu, Hirono became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1959, the year Hawaii became a state.[9] She attended Kaʻahumanu Elementary and Koko Head Elementary Schools. She graduated from Kaimuki High School, which at the time had a predominantly Japanese American student body. Hirono then enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in psychology in 1970.[10] She later attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where she obtained her juris doctor degree in 1978. Hirono then returned to Honolulu, where she practiced law.[11]\n\n\n\n## Hawaii House of Representatives (1981–1994)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, Hirono was elected to Hawaii's 12th House district in a multi-member district with Democratic State Representative David Hagino.[12] Hawaii eliminated multi-member districts, and after redistricting she ran for Hawaii's 20th House district and won.[13] After redistricting again in 1984, she ran successfully for the newly redrawn 32nd House District.[14] In 1992, after redistricting, she ran one last time in the newly redrawn 22nd House district. She easily won the three-candidate Democratic primary with 91% of the vote.[15] She won the general election and served only one term in the 22nd district before retiring in 1994 to run for statewide office.[16]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nHirono served in the Hawaii House of Representatives for 13 years, sponsoring 120 bills that became state law. \n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1992, she was Chair of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Committee.[17]\n\n\n\n## Lieutenant governor (1994–2002)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1994[edit]\n\n\nHirono ran for lieutenant governor of Hawaii and won the Democratic primary, defeating fellow State Representative Jackie Young 65%–26%.[18] In the general election she defeated three other candidates: Danny Kaniela Kaleikini (Best Party), State Representative Fred Hemmings (Republican Party), and Jack Morse (Green Party), 37%–31%–29%–4%.[19]\n\n\n\n#### 1998[edit]\n\n\nHirono ran for reelection in 1998. She defeated Nancy Cook in the primary with 89% of the vote to Cook's 11%.[20] In the general election, Hirono defeated Republican State Senator Stan Koki, 50%–49%, a margin of only 5,254 votes.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nThe election of the Democratic ticket was historic with respect to both candidates. Ben Cayetano was the first Filipino American elected governor, and Hirono was the first Japanese immigrant to be elected lieutenant governor. \n\n\nDuring her tenure as lieutenant governor, Hirono was president of the National Commission on Teaching, America's Future, and the Hawaii Policy Group. She also spearheaded the Pre-Plus program, a first-in-the-nation comprehensive universal preschool education program.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## 2002 gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 Hawaii gubernatorial election\n\nHirono originally planned to run for mayor of Honolulu in a potential 2002 special election created by the vacancy of incumbent Mayor Jeremy Harris, who was planning to resign in order to run for governor of Hawaii. But due to internal controversies, Harris dropped out of the gubernatorial election and remained mayor for another two years. Hirono switched races.\n\n\nHirono worked to gain the support of Hawaii Democrats in her primary against former State House Majority Leader Ed Case. After polling almost equally throughout the race, Hirono defeated Case in the September 21 Democratic primary with 41% of the vote to Case's 40%, a margin of 2,613 votes.[22][23][24]\n\n\nIn the general election, Republican nominee and Maui Mayor Linda Lingle defeated Hirono 52–47%, becoming Hawaii's first female governor.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (2007–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Congresswoman Hirono during the 110th Congress\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States House of Representatives elections in Hawaii § District 2\n\nOn September 23, Hirono ran to represent Hawaii's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives after incumbent Ed Case chose not to seek another term. The Democratic primary was crowded and very competitive. There were ten candidates, seven of whom served in the Hawaii Legislature. Hirono's advantage was that she was the only candidate who had held statewide office and as a result had the most name recognition. She led in fundraising, helped by the endorsement of EMILY's List.[27] She won with a plurality of 22% of the vote. State Senator Colleen Hanabusa finished second with 21%, 845 votes short of Hirono.[28][29]\n\n\nIn the general election Hirono defeated Republican State Senator Bob Hogue, 61%–39%.[30]\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Hawaii § District 2\n\nHirono won reelection to a second term with 76% of the vote.[31]\n\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Hawaii § District 2\n\nHirono won reelection to a third term with 72% of the vote.[32]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the national preschool advocacy organization named Hirono \"Pre-K Champion\" for her efforts to pass pre-kindergarten legislation.[33]\n\n\nHirono co-sponsored the Prevention First Act of 2007. The act aimed to increase public access to contraception and government funding to support the use of contraception.[34] It places an emphasis on informing and protecting women from unintended pregnancy.[34]\nOn May 4, 2011, Hirono voted against the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would have prohibited federal health care programs from covering abortion costs, with exceptions for life-threatening cases.[34]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Hirono voted for the Access to Birth Control Act, which mandates that pharmacies provide birth control to customers without undue delay.[34] The ABP Act also ensures that customers seeking birth control can obtain it without being submitted to unwanted harassment or breaches in patient confidentiality.[34]\nEMILY's List, a Democratic pro-choice action committee, pledged support to Hirono for her history of supporting contraceptive and abortion policies during her term.[34] The endorsement helped Hirono in her 2012 senatorial race, contributing $129,714 to her campaign.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments, 2012[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Education and the Workforce\n\t+ Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education\n\t+ Subcommittee on Workforce Protections\n* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Highways and Transit\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.\n\n\n### Caucus memberships, 2012[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[37]\n* Congressional Bike Caucus\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues\n* Congressional Lantos Human Rights Commission\n* Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus\n* Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus\n* Congressional National Parks Caucus\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus\n* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus\n* House Oceans Caucus\n* House Rural Health Care Coalition\n* International Conservation Caucus\n* National Marine Sanctuary Caucus\n* National Service Caucus\n* Port Security Caucus\n* Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus\n* Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n\nIn 2011, incumbent U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka announced his retirement at the end of his term in 2013. Subsequently, on May 19, 2011, Hirono announced her candidacy for Akaka's seat.[38] She won the Democratic primary election on August 11, 2012.[39] Hirono was endorsed as one of the Dean Dozen, a group of candidates chosen for their progressive values by Democracy for America, an organization founded by former Vermont governor Howard Dean. The Republican nominee was former Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle, who had defeated Hirono a decade earlier in the gubernatorial election. Hirono defeated Lingle with 63% of the vote.[40] She is the first female senator from Hawaii, as well as the first Asian-born immigrant to be elected to the U.S. Senate.[41] She was a part of the first completely non-Christian Congressional delegation from the state, which existed until the election of Mark Takai (an Episcopalian) in 2014 as the representative for Hawaii's 1st congressional district.[42]\n\n\nIn the 2012 campaign Hirono raised $5.2 million, with approximately 52% raised from large corporations. Lingle raised $5.5 million, with 74% from large corporations. Hirono spent $5 million and Lingle $4.8 million.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Hirono was reelected with 71.2% of the vote, defeating Republican Ron Curtis.[44]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2012, the Senate Democratic Steering Committee announced that Hirono would serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, giving her influence on matters ranging from approving nominations of federal judges to setting criminal-justice policy.\n\n\nDuring the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings in September 2018, Hirono was an outspoken defender of Christine Blasey Ford after Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, telling men to \"shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change.\"[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Hirono called for the resignation of fellow senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley for their opposition to certifying the 2020 presidential election Electoral College count.[48] She also called for the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office.[49]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Hirono sponsored a bill attempting to decrease hate crimes against Asian Americans due to xenophobia associated with COVID-19. The bill passed the Senate 94–1, with only Hawley opposing it.[50]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Hirono co-sponsored the Youth Voting Rights Act*,* comprehensive legislation to enforce the Twenty-Sixth Amendment and expand youth access to voting. This legislation, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, was also introduced in the House by Representative Nikema Williams.[51]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hirono speaking at the \"No Muslim Ban Ever\" rally outside the Supreme Court, April 2018\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support (Chair)\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources[52]\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n* Committee on the Judiciary\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n\n### Select caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Executive Board Member\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[53]\n* Congressional Study Group on Japan, Co-Chair\n* Creative Rights Caucus, Co-Chair\n* Senate Army Caucus\n* Senate Climate Change Task Force\n* Senate Impact Aid Coalition, Co-Chair\n* Senate Law Enforcement Caucus\n* Seante Oceans Caucus\n* Expand Social Security Caucus\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hirono at a Stop the Bans rally in 2019\nAccording to On the Issues, Hirono's voting history places her in the \"left/liberal\" camp.[54] The American Conservative Union gave her a 2% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[55]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nHirono has a 100% rating from Naral Pro-Choice America.[54] She has also been consistently endorsed by EMILY's List, an organization that endorses women running on pro-choice platforms.[56] At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Hirono told the panel: \"If you don't support abortion, don't get one, but leave everyone else to the painful decisions they have to make along with their physicians\".[57]\n\n\nHirono called the June 2022 overturning of *Roe v. Wade* \"a horrific day in America\".[58] She proclaimed, \"This will go down as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court.\"[59]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, she participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. Hirono expressed disappointment when the Democrat-proposed Feinstein Amendment (banning the sale of firearms to individuals on the terrorist watchlist) and the Republican-backed background check expansion and alert system (regarding guns being sold to terrorist watchlist suspects) both failed to pass the Senate.[60]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2017, two months after undergoing surgery for stage-four kidney cancer, Hirono spoke on the Senate floor and voted against the so-called \"skinny repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[61] MSNBC reporter Kyle Griffin filmed Hirono's speech and posted it on Twitter.[62]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Hirono was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the effect of the government shutdown on the public health and employees while expressing alarm \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[63]\n\n\nHirono is a supporter of Medicare for All.[64]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Hirono was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to a Senate subcommittee on housing praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[65]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQIA+ rights[edit]\n\n\nHirono supports the right of LGBTQ+ Americans to enlist in the Armed Forces.[66] She also supported H.R. 1681, the Every Child Deserves a Family Act, a \"non-discrimination\" bill that would have decertified any foster care or adoption agency that did not accept same-sex foster parents regardless of religious beliefs.[67]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Hirono was one of seven senators to sponsor the Digital Equity Act of 2019, legislation establishing a $120 million grant program that would fund the creation and implementation of \"comprehensive digital equity plans\" in every state and a $120 million grant program to support projects developed by individuals and groups. The bill also gave the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) the role of evaluating and providing guidance for digital equity projects.[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Hirono was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer, which had spread to her seventh rib.[69] The cancer was discovered in a chest X-ray in April before minor eye surgery.[70] Hirono's right kidney was removed on May 17, 2017, with a Cyberknife procedure to treat the rib lesion.[71][69] She returned to the Senate on May 22, 2017.[72]\n\n\nAs of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Hirono's net worth was more than $4.3 million.[73]\n\n\nIn 2021, Viking Press published Hirono's autobiography, *Heart of Fire: An Immigrant Daughter's Story*.[74] *Marie Claire* listed the book among its \"25 Great Memoirs to Pre-Order Now\".[75]\n\n\nAlso in 2021, it was announced that Hirono would receive Japan's Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star for her \"significant contributions in strengthening bilateral relations and promoting legislative exchanges between Japan and the United States\".[76]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHawaii gubernatorial election, 2002[77]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Linda Lingle**  | **197,009**  | **51.56%**  | **+2.74%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Mazie Hirono\n | 179,647\n | 47.01%\n | -3.09%\n |\n|  | Natural Law | Bu Laʻia Hill | 2,561\n | 0.67%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Tracy Ryan\n | 1,364\n | 0.36%\n | -0.72%\n |\n|  | Independent | Jim Brewer\n | 1,147\n | 0.30%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Daniel Cunningham\n | 382\n | 0.10%\n | N/A\n |\n| Total votes\n | **382,110**  | **100.00%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Republican **gain** from Democratic |\n\n\n\n\nHawaii's 2nd congressional district election, 2006\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Mazie Hirono**  | **106,906**  | **61.04%**  |\n|  | Republican | Bob Hogue | 68,244\n | 38.96%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **175,150**  | **100.00%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nHawaii's 2nd congressional district election, 2008\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Mazie Hirono (inc.)**  | **165,748**  | **76.06%**  |\n|  | Republican | Roger B.

A member of the Democratic Party, Hirono previously served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district from 2007 to 2013. Hirono also served as a member of the Hawaii House of Representatives from 1981 to 1995 and as Hawaii's tenth lieutenant governor from 1994 to 2002, under Ben Cayetano. She was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for governor of Hawaii in 2002, defeated by Republican Linda Lingle in the general election.\n\n\nHirono is the first elected female senator from Hawaii, the first Asian-American woman elected to the Senate, the first U.S. senator born in Japan, and the nation's first Buddhist senator. She considers herself a non-practicing Buddhist[1][2] and is often cited with Hank Johnson as the first Buddhist to serve in the United States Congress.[3] She is also the third woman to be elected to Congress from Hawaii (after Patsy Mink and Pat Saiki).\n\n\nIn 2012, Hirono was the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Daniel Akaka. Hirono won the election, defeating Lingle in a landslide, 63% to 37%. She was sworn in on January 3, 2013, by Vice President Joe Biden. Hirono was the only person of Asian ancestry serving in the U.S. Senate from 2013 until 2017, when senators Tammy Duckworth and Kamala Harris were sworn in, representing Illinois and California, respectively. Although Brian Schatz is Hawaii's senior senator because he joined the Senate a week before Hirono, following the death of Daniel Inouye, Hirono's three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives make her the dean, or longest-serving member overall, of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMazie Hirono was born on November 3, 1947, in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan to Laura Chie Satō, a Japanese American, and Hirono Matabe, a Japanese veteran of World War II. Mazie's maternal grandfather, Hiroshi Satō, immigrated to Hawaii to work on a sugar plantation at the age of 16; her grandmother, Tari Shinoki, immigrated to Hawaii as a picture bride.[4] After finding plantation work difficult, the couple opened a bathhouse on River Street in Honolulu in 1928. The couple had a daughter, Laura Chie, in 1924, and a son, Akira.\n\n\nIn 1939, Tari returned to Japan with the teenaged Laura and Akira; Hiroshi remained in Hawaii to run the bathhouse for two more years before joining his family in 1941. Laura felt out of place in Japan as one of the many Nisei Japanese Americans who emigrated with their returning Issei parents (barred from US citizenship or land ownership) before World War II and during the Great Depression. But although her brother returned to Hawaii after the war, she remained in Japan and married a veterinarian, Hirono Matabe, in 1946. Laura moved with her husband to southern Fukushima, and had three children, Roy, Mazie, and Wayne. Mazie, the middle child, was the only surviving daughter.[5]\n\n\nMazie's father, Matabe, was a compulsive gambler and alcoholic who pawned even his wife's possessions for gambling money.[5] Treated \"like a slave\" by her in-laws,[5] Mazie's mother finally left the abusive marriage in 1951. Laura later recounted her point of decision: \"My brother sent money to buy a school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town and never came back home. It was getting closer to the start of school, so I went to look for him. I found out he had ordered an overcoat for himself with the money. He didn't need an overcoat in the spring. That's when I made up my mind to leave.\"[4] After telling her in-laws she was going to take her children to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return. Selling her clothes to pay the rail fare, she and the children moved back to her parents' home. Laura said, \"My husband never came around once; my parents were supportive and took all of us in. My mother gave us money. I guess it all boils down to love.\"\n\n\nThe Satō-Hirono family decided to return to Hawaii, but under the U.S. quota system Tari and Hiroshi, as Japanese nationals without American citizenship or professional status, could not go with Laura, an American citizen. Thus the family was separated, with three-year-old Wayne staying behind with his grandparents and Laura returning to Honolulu on her own with Mazie and Roy in March 1955. After two years of hard work, she brought her parents and youngest son to Hawaii in 1957.[4] \"She determined that she had to get away [from her husband]...she wanted to put thousands of miles between them\", Hirono said of her mother. \"That took a lot of courage. I always tell my mom there is nothing I can do—hard as it is to be in politics...harder than what she did.\"[4][5]\n\n\nAfter first living with Mazie's uncle Akira, the family moved into a rooming house on Kewalo Street in Honolulu with one room, one table, three chairs and one bed. Laura recalled, \"Mazie and Roy slept on the bed. I slept on the floor with a futon. The landlady was so nice. The rent was $35, but she charged us less because I didn't have a job.\"[4] Laura began working for the Hawaii Hochi as a typesetter and also three nights a week for a catering company. Mazie worked in the school cafeteria and had a paper route.[6] Though money was tight and the family was forced to move often, Laura kept them together. Mazie recalled that she and her brother used to get a dime once or twice a week from their mother. \"We both had baseball piggy banks. My older brother spent all his dimes but I saved mine. But one day I came home and the dimes were gone. My mother had to use it to buy food.\"\n\n\nHirono never saw her father again, and he has since died.[7] Laura became a newspaper proofreader in 1961 and retired from the Hawaii Newspaper Agency in 1986; Roy became a Hawaiian Electric supervisor. Wayne drowned in 1978, aged 26. Mazie's grandfather Hiroshi died in 1989, and her grandmother Tari died in 2000 at age 99.[4][8]\n\n\nRaised in Honolulu, Hirono became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1959, the year Hawaii became a state.[9] She attended Kaʻahumanu Elementary and Koko Head Elementary Schools. She graduated from Kaimuki High School, which at the time had a predominantly Japanese American student body. Hirono then enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, graduating Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in psychology in 1970.[10] She later attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., where she obtained her juris doctor degree in 1978. Hirono then returned to Honolulu, where she practiced law.[11]\n\n\n\n## Hawaii House of Representatives (1981–1994)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, Hirono was elected to Hawaii's 12th House district in a multi-member district with Democratic State Representative David Hagino.[12] Hawaii eliminated multi-member districts, and after redistricting she ran for Hawaii's 20th House district and won.[13] After redistricting again in 1984, she ran successfully for the newly redrawn 32nd House District.[14] In 1992, after redistricting, she ran one last time in the newly redrawn 22nd House district. She easily won the three-candidate Democratic primary with 91% of the vote.[15] She won the general election and served only one term in the 22nd district before retiring in 1994 to run for statewide office.[16]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nHirono served in the Hawaii House of Representatives for 13 years, sponsoring 120 bills that became state law. \n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1992, she was Chair of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Committee.[17]\n\n\n\n## Lieutenant governor (1994–2002)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1994[edit]\n\n\nHirono ran for lieutenant governor of Hawaii and won the Democratic primary, defeating fellow State Representative Jackie Young 65%–26%.[18] In the general election she defeated three other candidates: Danny Kaniela Kaleikini (Best Party), State Representative Fred Hemmings (Republican Party), and Jack Morse (Green Party), 37%–31%–29%–4%.[19]\n\n\n\n#### 1998[edit]\n\n\nHirono ran for reelection in 1998. She defeated Nancy Cook in the primary with 89% of the vote to Cook's 11%.[20] In the general election, Hirono defeated Republican State Senator Stan Koki, 50%–49%, a margin of only 5,254 votes.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nThe election of the Democratic ticket was historic with respect to both candidates. Ben Cayetano was the first Filipino American elected governor, and Hirono was the first Japanese immigrant to be elected lieutenant governor. \n\n\nDuring her tenure as lieutenant governor, Hirono was president of the National Commission on Teaching, America's Future, and the Hawaii Policy Group. She also spearheaded the Pre-Plus program, a first-in-the-nation comprehensive universal preschool education program.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## 2002 gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2002 Hawaii gubernatorial election\n\nHirono originally planned to run for mayor of Honolulu in a potential 2002 special election created by the vacancy of incumbent Mayor Jeremy Harris, who was planning to resign in order to run for governor of Hawaii. But due to internal controversies, Harris dropped out of the gubernatorial election and remained mayor for another two years. Hirono switched races.\n\n\nHirono worked to gain the support of Hawaii Democrats in her primary against former State House Majority Leader Ed Case. After polling almost equally throughout the race, Hirono defeated Case in the September 21 Democratic primary with 41% of the vote to Case's 40%, a margin of 2,613 votes.[22][23][24]\n\n\nIn the general election, Republican nominee and Maui Mayor Linda Lingle defeated Hirono 52–47%, becoming Hawaii's first female governor.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (2007–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Congresswoman Hirono during the 110th Congress\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States House of Representatives elections in Hawaii § District 2\n\nOn September 23, Hirono ran to represent Hawaii's 2nd congressional district in the House of Representatives after incumbent Ed Case chose not to seek another term. The Democratic primary was crowded and very competitive. There were ten candidates, seven of whom served in the Hawaii Legislature. Hirono's advantage was that she was the only candidate who had held statewide office and as a result had the most name recognition. She led in fundraising, helped by the endorsement of EMILY's List.[27] She won with a plurality of 22% of the vote. State Senator Colleen Hanabusa finished second with 21%, 845 votes short of Hirono.[28][29]\n\n\nIn the general election Hirono defeated Republican State Senator Bob Hogue, 61%–39%.[30]\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 United States House of Representatives elections in Hawaii § District 2\n\nHirono won reelection to a second term with 76% of the vote.[31]\n\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Hawaii § District 2\n\nHirono won reelection to a third term with 72% of the vote.[32]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the national preschool advocacy organization named Hirono \"Pre-K Champion\" for her efforts to pass pre-kindergarten legislation.[33]\n\n\nHirono co-sponsored the Prevention First Act of 2007. The act aimed to increase public access to contraception and government funding to support the use of contraception.[34] It places an emphasis on informing and protecting women from unintended pregnancy.[34]\nOn May 4, 2011, Hirono voted against the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would have prohibited federal health care programs from covering abortion costs, with exceptions for life-threatening cases.[34]\n\n\nIn July 2011, Hirono voted for the Access to Birth Control Act, which mandates that pharmacies provide birth control to customers without undue delay.[34] The ABP Act also ensures that customers seeking birth control can obtain it without being submitted to unwanted harassment or breaches in patient confidentiality.[34]\nEMILY's List, a Democratic pro-choice action committee, pledged support to Hirono for her history of supporting contraceptive and abortion policies during her term.[34] The endorsement helped Hirono in her 2012 senatorial race, contributing $129,714 to her campaign.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments, 2012[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Education and the Workforce\n\t+ Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education\n\t+ Subcommittee on Workforce Protections\n* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Highways and Transit\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.\n\n\n### Caucus memberships, 2012[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[37]\n* Congressional Bike Caucus\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues\n* Congressional Lantos Human Rights Commission\n* Congressional Labor and Working Families Caucus\n* Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus\n* Congressional National Parks Caucus\n* Congressional Progressive Caucus\n* Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus\n* House Oceans Caucus\n* House Rural Health Care Coalition\n* International Conservation Caucus\n* National Marine Sanctuary Caucus\n* National Service Caucus\n* Port Security Caucus\n* Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus\n* Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n\nIn 2011, incumbent U.S. Senator Daniel Akaka announced his retirement at the end of his term in 2013. Subsequently, on May 19, 2011, Hirono announced her candidacy for Akaka's seat.[38] She won the Democratic primary election on August 11, 2012.[39] Hirono was endorsed as one of the Dean Dozen, a group of candidates chosen for their progressive values by Democracy for America, an organization founded by former Vermont governor Howard Dean. The Republican nominee was former Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle, who had defeated Hirono a decade earlier in the gubernatorial election. Hirono defeated Lingle with 63% of the vote.[40] She is the first female senator from Hawaii, as well as the first Asian-born immigrant to be elected to the U.S. Senate.[41] She was a part of the first completely non-Christian Congressional delegation from the state, which existed until the election of Mark Takai (an Episcopalian) in 2014 as the representative for Hawaii's 1st congressional district.[42]\n\n\nIn the 2012 campaign Hirono raised $5.2 million, with approximately 52% raised from large corporations. Lingle raised $5.5 million, with 74% from large corporations. Hirono spent $5 million and Lingle $4.8 million.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n\nOn November 6, 2018, Hirono was reelected with 71.2% of the vote, defeating Republican Ron Curtis.[44]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2012, the Senate Democratic Steering Committee announced that Hirono would serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, giving her influence on matters ranging from approving nominations of federal judges to setting criminal-justice policy.\n\n\nDuring the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings in September 2018, Hirono was an outspoken defender of Christine Blasey Ford after Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, telling men to \"shut up and step up. Do the right thing for a change.\"[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Hirono called for the resignation of fellow senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley for their opposition to certifying the 2020 presidential election Electoral College count.[48] She also called for the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be invoked to remove Donald Trump from office.[49]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Hirono sponsored a bill attempting to decrease hate crimes against Asian Americans due to xenophobia associated with COVID-19. The bill passed the Senate 94–1, with only Hawley opposing it.[50]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Hirono co-sponsored the Youth Voting Rights Act*,* comprehensive legislation to enforce the Twenty-Sixth Amendment and expand youth access to voting. This legislation, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, was also introduced in the House by Representative Nikema Williams.[51]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hirono speaking at the \"No Muslim Ban Ever\" rally outside the Supreme Court, April 2018\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support (Chair)\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources[52]\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n* Committee on the Judiciary\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n\n### Select caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, Executive Board Member\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[53]\n* Congressional Study Group on Japan, Co-Chair\n* Creative Rights Caucus, Co-Chair\n* Senate Army Caucus\n* Senate Climate Change Task Force\n* Senate Impact Aid Coalition, Co-Chair\n* Senate Law Enforcement Caucus\n* Seante Oceans Caucus\n* Expand Social Security Caucus\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hirono at a Stop the Bans rally in 2019\nAccording to On the Issues, Hirono's voting history places her in the \"left/liberal\" camp.[54] The American Conservative Union gave her a 2% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[55]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nHirono has a 100% rating from Naral Pro-Choice America.[54] She has also been consistently endorsed by EMILY's List, an organization that endorses women running on pro-choice platforms.[56] At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Hirono told the panel: \"If you don't support abortion, don't get one, but leave everyone else to the painful decisions they have to make along with their physicians\".[57]\n\n\nHirono called the June 2022 overturning of *Roe v. Wade* \"a horrific day in America\".[58] She proclaimed, \"This will go down as one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court.\"[59]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, she participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster. Hirono expressed disappointment when the Democrat-proposed Feinstein Amendment (banning the sale of firearms to individuals on the terrorist watchlist) and the Republican-backed background check expansion and alert system (regarding guns being sold to terrorist watchlist suspects) both failed to pass the Senate.[60]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2017, two months after undergoing surgery for stage-four kidney cancer, Hirono spoke on the Senate floor and voted against the so-called \"skinny repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).[61] MSNBC reporter Kyle Griffin filmed Hirono's speech and posted it on Twitter.[62]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Hirono was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the effect of the government shutdown on the public health and employees while expressing alarm \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[63]\n\n\nHirono is a supporter of Medicare for All.[64]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Hirono was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to a Senate subcommittee on housing praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[65]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQIA+ rights[edit]\n\n\nHirono supports the right of LGBTQ+ Americans to enlist in the Armed Forces.[66] She also supported H.R. 1681, the Every Child Deserves a Family Act, a \"non-discrimination\" bill that would have decertified any foster care or adoption agency that did not accept same-sex foster parents regardless of religious beliefs.[67]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Hirono was one of seven senators to sponsor the Digital Equity Act of 2019, legislation establishing a $120 million grant program that would fund the creation and implementation of \"comprehensive digital equity plans\" in every state and a $120 million grant program to support projects developed by individuals and groups. The bill also gave the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) the role of evaluating and providing guidance for digital equity projects.[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Hirono was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer, which had spread to her seventh rib.[69] The cancer was discovered in a chest X-ray in April before minor eye surgery.[70] Hirono's right kidney was removed on May 17, 2017, with a Cyberknife procedure to treat the rib lesion.[71][69] She returned to the Senate on May 22, 2017.[72]\n\n\nAs of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Hirono's net worth was more than $4.3 million.[73]\n\n\nIn 2021, Viking Press published Hirono's autobiography, *Heart of Fire: An Immigrant Daughter's Story*.[74] *Marie Claire* listed the book among its \"25 Great Memoirs to Pre-Order Now\".[75]\n\n\nAlso in 2021, it was announced that Hirono would receive Japan's Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star for her \"significant contributions in strengthening bilateral relations and promoting legislative exchanges between Japan and the United States\".[76]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHawaii gubernatorial election, 2002[77]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Linda Lingle**  | **197,009**  | **51.56%**  | **+2.74%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Mazie Hirono\n | 179,647\n | 47.01%\n | -3.09%\n |\n|  | Natural Law | Bu Laʻia Hill | 2,561\n | 0.67%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Tracy Ryan\n | 1,364\n | 0.36%\n | -0.72%\n |\n|  | Independent | Jim Brewer\n | 1,147\n | 0.30%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Daniel Cunningham\n | 382\n | 0.10%\n | N/A\n |\n| Total votes\n | **382,110**  | **100.00%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Republican **gain** from Democratic |\n\n\n\n\nHawaii's 2nd congressional district election, 2006\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Mazie Hirono**  | **106,906**  | **61.04%**  |\n|  | Republican | Bob Hogue | 68,244\n | 38.96%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **175,150**  | **100.00%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nHawaii's 2nd congressional district election, 2008\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Mazie Hirono (inc.)**  | **165,748**  | **76.06%**  |\n|  | Republican | Roger B.

In 1999, she was elected to the Mississippi State Senate as a Democrat. She represented the 39th district from 2000 to 2012. In 2010, Hyde-Smith switched parties and became a Republican, citing her conservative beliefs.[3] Hyde-Smith was elected Mississippi agriculture commissioner in 2011, the first woman elected to that office, and reelected in 2015.\n\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Governor Phil Bryant announced his intention to appoint Hyde-Smith to the United States Senate seat being vacated due to the resignation of Thad Cochran.[4] Hyde-Smith was sworn into office on April 9, 2018. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress.[5] Hyde-Smith was a candidate in the 2018 U.S. Senate special election for the remainder of Cochran's term, which expired in 2021.[6] She finished first in the top-two general election on November 6, 2018, but did not receive more than 50% of the vote, thus advancing to a November 27 special runoff election versus Mike Espy. Hyde-Smith won the runoff election,[7] becoming the first woman elected to Congress from Mississippi.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, the daughter of Lorraine Hyde and Luther Hyde, and grew up in Monticello, Mississippi.[1] She attended Lawrence County Academy in Monticello, a segregation academy established in response to Supreme Court rulings ordering the desegregation of public schools.[9] The school's team nickname was the Rebels; the mascot was a \"Col. Reb\" who carried a Confederate flag.[9][10][11][12]\n\n\nHyde-Smith graduated from Copiah–Lincoln Community College with an Associate of Arts (AA) and the University of Southern Mississippi with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in criminal justice and political science.[13] She is one of the few U.S. senators who attended community college. After her studies, she worked as a lobbyist for the Southern Coalition for Safer Highways and National Coalition for Healthcare, with offices in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.[14][15] She served as the state director for Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee during her time with the National Coalition for Healthcare, which advocated nationwide healthcare coverage.[16]\n\n\n\n## Mississippi Senate[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was a member of the Mississippi Senate, representing the 39th District from 2000 to 2012. For part of her tenure, she chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee, which led her Senate colleagues to encourage her to run for Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce.[17][18] She had a conservative voting record in the state Senate.[19] During her time in the state Senate, 79 of her bills became law.[20] She supported measures to collect DNA samples from people in custody of the Department of Corrections and authored a bill to ban most abortions after 12 weeks. After the abortion restriction bill passed and was signed by then-Governor Haley Barbour, it was overturned in federal court. On the Senate Agriculture Committee, Hyde-Smith also helped manage the fallout from a controversial beef plant that defaulted on a $55 million state loan. The state sued firms involved in the construction of a 400-employee plant in Yalobusha County that closed three months after it opened, in August 2004. The state eventually settled with the plant owners for $4 million.[21] In 2001, Hyde-Smith introduced legislation to name a portion of Highway 51 for Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, who had no ties to the area. The bill died in committee. Hyde-Smith also voted for resolutions honoring civil rights leader Medgar Evers, the Freedom Riders and Hiram Rhodes Revels, who, through legislative appointment during Reconstruction, became the first African American to represent Mississippi in the U.S. Senate.[22] In 2009, Hyde-Smith led an effort to override Barbour's veto of a bill that sought to restrict the power of eminent domain to public use, thereby prohibiting eminent domain for private economic purposes. The bill passed the state House 119-3[23] and the state Senate unanimously.[24] Barbour vetoed the bill on the grounds that the restriction could harm the state's business climate. The legislature attempted to override his veto, but was unsuccessful. In the House, the override vote was successful with a 101–19 vote,[25] but it failed in the Senate, 28–22.[26] Hyde-Smith was critical of senators who switched their vote after the veto, saying, \"Not only could you never come to this podium again and say 'I protect private property rights', you're still gonna have to say 'I changed my vote to vote against private property rights'.\"[27]\n\n\nOn December 28, 2010, Hyde-Smith announced that she had switched her party affiliation from Democratic to Republican.[13][28] Her switch made the Senate equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, with each party holding 26 seats.[19] In 2011, Senator Ezell Lee also switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican, which gave Republicans a 27-25 majority heading into the 2011 elections. This marked the first time since the Reconstruction era in which Republicans held a majority of seats in the chamber.\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith first sought election to the Mississippi Senate in 1999, as she concluded her career as a lobbyist and transitioned back to the state. She returned to Mississippi, gave birth to her daughter, and qualified to run for state Senate all in one year.[29] Her opponent in the 1999 Mississippi Senate Democratic primary was 20-year incumbent W. L. Rayborn. She perceived that Rayborn prioritized his personal interests over his district's and had supported his opponents in the previous two elections. During the campaign, Hyde-Smith refused to criticize him or target specific issues. Rayborn was known for a pet cause—allowing non-dentists to make false teeth. A denturist without a dental degree, he showed up to the Capitol a few days each session adorned with buttons and stickers promoting his bill \"The Freedom of Choice Dentures Act.\" In 1999, his last year in office, it died in committee.[30] Hyde-Smith defeated Rayborn in the Democratic primary and Republican Helen Price and independent Frank Greer in the general election, with 75.36% of the vote.[31]\n\n\nIn the 2003 Democratic primary, Rayborn challenged Hyde-Smith in the newly redrawn state Senate District 39 and lost, 65.47% to 34.53%.[32] Hyde-Smith was unopposed in the general election.\n\n\nIn 2007, Hyde-Smith was unopposed in the Senate District 39 Democratic primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Edwin V. Case with 79.45% of the vote. This was her last election in the Senate district.[33]\n\n\n\n## Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith as Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce\nIn January 2011, Hyde-Smith announced her candidacy for Mississippi's commissioner of agriculture and commerce.[34] She won the Republican nomination in August[35] and the general election in November, defeating Democratic nominee Joel Gill, to become the first woman to win this position.[36] She took office on January 5, 2012.[37]\n\n\nIn June 2012, in response to a massive infestation of plant bugs in cotton farms throughout the Mississippi Delta (which had caused approximately $81 million in damages), Hyde-Smith said that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had approved an emergency exemption to help farmers exterminate the bugs.[38]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Hyde-Smith successfully pushed for legislation to help fund a big renovation project for the Mississippi Coliseum.[39] In December 2013, she received a Service Award from the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation for the project.[40]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was reelected in 2015, defeating Democratic nominee Addie Lee Green by over twenty points.[41] She was sworn in for her second term on January 7, 2016.[42] In April 2016, Hyde-Smith announced that the Mississippi Department of Agriculture would be accepting proposals for both the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and the Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program for the year's federal budget.[43]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Mike Pence swears in Smith at the Old Senate Chamber in 2018\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Governor Phil Bryant announced Hyde-Smith as his choice to fill the United States Senate seat held by Thad Cochran, who indicated he would resign the seat due to health issues.[44] Cochran resigned on April 1, and Bryant formally appointed Hyde-Smith on April 2.[2] Hyde-Smith became the first woman to represent Mississippi in the United States Congress.[45][46] The Senate was in a district work period and was not conducting legislative business at that time, so she did not take the oath of office until the Senate reconvened for legislative business on April 9.[47] At her ceremonial swearing in, Hyde-Smith was accompanied by her husband, Michael, and U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, Orrin Hatch, Lamar Alexander, Chuck Schumer, and Susan Collins.[46] Hyde-Smith announced that she would seek election to the seat in the 2018 special election on November 6.[48]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018 special election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate special election in Mississippi\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly did not support Hyde-Smith's Senate appointment because of her history as a Democrat,[49][50] but in August 2018, Trump endorsed her for election.[51] He stumped for Hyde-Smith in suburban northern Mississippi.[52]\n\n\nIn the 2018 special election, Hyde-Smith was challenged by Republican Chris McDaniel, who criticized her past Democratic affiliation. Hyde-Smith responded that she had \"always been a conservative\" and added that she had the support of Republican Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.[53] She highlighted her support for Second Amendment rights, opposition to abortion, and advocacy for the state's defense business.[54]\n\n\nHyde-Smith declined to debate her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy, before the November 6 special election; Cochran had often done the same.[55] After she and Espy each finished with about 41% of the vote,[56] she agreed to debate Espy on November 20 before the runoff election.[57]\n\n\nDuring the runoff campaign, while appearing with cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson in Tupelo, Mississippi, Hyde-Smith said, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be in the front row.\" The remark immediately drew harsh criticism, given Mississippi's notorious history of lynchings and public executions of African-Americans. In response to the criticism, Hyde-Smith downplayed her comment as \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" and called the backlash \"ridiculous.\"[58][59][60][61][62][63] She refused to apologize.[64][65]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, Hyde-Smith joined Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant at a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi, where she was asked repeatedly about her comment by reporters. She repeatedly responded, \"I put out a statement yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about it.\"[66][67] When reporters redirected questions to Bryant, he defended Hyde-Smith's comment and changed the subject to abortion, saying he was \"confused about where the outrage is at about 20 million African American children that have been aborted.\"[68]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2018, Hyde-Smith appeared in a video clip saying that it would be \"a great idea\" to make it more difficult for liberals to vote.[69] Her campaign said Hyde-Smith was obviously joking and that the video was selectively edited. Both this and the \"public hanging\" video were released by Lamar White Jr., a Louisiana blogger and journalist.[70]\n\n\nAlso in November 2018, media reports noted that Hyde-Smith attended a school that was created to avoid court-mandated racial integration and made use of various confederate symbols, and that she sent her daughter to a similar school.[9][71]\n\n\nThe runoff election was held on November 27. Hyde-Smith defeated Espy, 53.9%-46.1%.[72][73]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in Mississippi\n\nIn January 2020, Hyde-Smith filed to run for a full term in the November election.[74] She was renominated unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated Espy again in the general election, by ten percentage points.[75]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyde-Smith during the 115th Congress\n![](image)Hyde-Smith during the 117th Congress\nOn October 6, 2018, Hyde-Smith voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States.[76] On October 26, 2020, she voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Court.[77]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Hyde-Smith was participating in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count debate about Arizona's electoral votes when Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. She and other senators were removed from the Senate floor to an undisclosed location shortly after the Capitol was breached. Her staff had to shelter in her office.[78] During the attack, Hyde-Smith tweeted: \"Whatever frustrations any American may have, violence & destruction in the US Capitol, the seat of our democratic government, is unacceptable\".[79] She later said that she was afraid during the storming of the Capitol and called the rioters \"criminals who need to be prosecuted\".[80]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch\n\t+ Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water and Power\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith identifies herself as a conservative Republican.[81] From 1999 to 2010, she served in elected office as a Democrat. She voted in the Democratic primary in 2008[82] and described herself as having been a conservative Democrat during her tenure in the state legislature.[83] She switched to the Republican Party in 2010.\n\n\nIn 2012, Hyde-Smith endorsed Republican nominee Mitt Romney for U.S. president.[84]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight reported that as of January 2021, Hyde-Smith had voted in line with Donald Trump's political positions about 92% of the time.[85] It also reported that as of November 2022, she had voted in line with President Joe Biden's political positions about 38.9% of the time.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2021 United States Electoral College vote count[edit]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Hyde-Smith joined four other senators in voting to object to the certification of Arizona's electoral votes.[87] She said she based her decision on \"the erosion of integrity of the electoral process.\" Hyde-Smith added that her constituents \"do not believe the presidential election was constitutional and cannot accept the Electoral College decision.\" Her position differed from that of fellow Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who supported certification.[88] She also voted not to certify Pennsylvania's electoral votes.[89] The *Jackson Free Press* called on Hyde-Smith to \"recant or resign\" for objecting to the certification of Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes.[90]\n\n\nFollowing the attack on the Capitol, Hyde-Smith did not support invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office. She also said she would not vote to convict Trump in the event of an impeachment trial.[91]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Hyde-Smith voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[92]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Hyde-Smith expressed opposition to the For the People Act, which would expand voting rights, falsely claiming that the bill would nullify voter identification laws in Mississippi.[93] She also objected to allowing people to vote on Sunday, which is the Christian Sabbath and a day that black churches coordinate rides to polling places for their parishioners.[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith describes her economic positions as fiscally conservative.[96]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hyde-Smith was one of 29 Republicans who joined all Democrats in opposing Senator Rand Paul's bill to cut federal spending by 1% over five years, known as the Penny Bill.[97] Republican opponents of the bill said it could threaten federal defense and domestic programs.[97] She faced criticism from the bill's supporters.[98]\n\n\nHyde-Smith supported the Trump-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[99] As a state legislator, she voted in favor of increasing unemployment benefits and in favor of raising taxes on cigarettes.[100] She also voted with all Mississippi Democrats in the state legislature to restore funding that had been previously eliminated due to budget cuts.[101]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Hyde-Smith was a cosponsor of the Transporting Livestock Across America Safely Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Ben Sasse and Jon Tester intended to reform hours of service for livestock haulers by authorizing drivers to rest at any point during their trip without it being counted against their hours of service and exempting loading and unloading times from the hours of service calculation of driving time.[102]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Hyde-Smith was one of eight senators to introduce the Agricultural Trucking Relief Act, a bill that would alter the definition of an agricultural commodity to include both horticultural and aquacultural products and promote greater consistency in regulation through both federal and state agencies as part of an attempt to ease regulatory burdens on trucking and the agri-community.[103]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Hyde-Smith co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[105][106]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), saying that it \"has failed Mississippi.\"[107] She is in favor of repealing it but says that she supports keeping provisions ensuring protections for preexisting conditions.[107] While in the Senate, she voted to expand the use of short-term health insurance plans, which can discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.[107]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Hyde-Smith was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), a bill intended to strengthen training for new and existing physicians, people who teach palliative care, and other providers who are on the palliative care team that grants patients and their families a voice in their care and treatment goals.[108]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Hyde-Smith was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyde-Smith and Brett Kavanaugh in July 2018\nIn March 2019 Hyde-Smith was one of 12 senators to co-sponsor a resolution in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices. The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to expanding the number of seats on the Supreme Court.[110]\n\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith's 2018 campaign described her as having a \"strong social conservative voting record with a 100 percent pro-life rating [who is] a lifetime member of the NRA.\"[45] Gun Owners of America, which supports gun owners' rights and is in favor of loosening restrictions on guns, gave her a rating of 50% in 2018.[111]\n\n\nHyde-Smith opposes abortion.[112] As a state senator, she authored a bill requiring that all abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy be performed in a hospital or ambulatory surgical facility; the bill was blocked by federal courts.[113] In 2018, she voted with Senate Republicans to prohibit federal funding from being given to any organization or facility that promotes abortion services or family planning.[114] She opposes Planned Parenthood, describing it as \"one of the worst things that has ever happened to us.\"[107]\n\n\nIn 2018 Hyde-Smith released a statement supporting the Trump administration's travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries.[115] Her campaign website says she supports the construction of a wall along the southern US border.[116]\n\n\nIn 2012, as the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, Hyde-Smith was personally opposed to a same-sex commitment ceremony at the Mississippi Agriculture & Forestry Museum, but instructed the museum to allow it after consulting with Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. She declared she would seek a change in state law and request from the legislature \"clear and straightforward definitions about what activities can take place on the property owned by the State of Mississippi.\"[117] In November 2022, she voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation that codifies same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[118][119]\n\n\n\n### Confederate States of America[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Hyde-Smith voted for a resolution that praised a Confederate States Army soldier for his efforts to \"defend his homeland\".[120] During her first term in the Mississippi Senate, she proposed renaming a state highway after Confederate President Jefferson Davis, but the legislation did not pass.[121] In 2014, Hyde-Smith posted a photo of herself at Davis's home, Beauvoir, wearing a Confederate cap and carrying a rifle, with the caption \"Mississippi history at its best!\"[120][122]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nOn February 5, 2020, at the first impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Hyde-Smith voted to acquit Trump. He was acquitted.[123]\n\n\nOn February 13, 2021, at Trump's second impeachment trial, Hyde-Smith voted to acquit Trump. He was acquitted.[124]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith is married to a cattle farmer, Mike Smith. They are members of the Macedonia Baptist Church. They have a daughter who graduated in 2017 from Brookhaven Academy.[9][125]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### Mississippi State Senate[edit]\n\n\n\n\nMississippi State Senate 39th district election, 2003[126][127]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Cindy Hyde-Smith (incumbent)**  | **11,944**  | **65.47**  |\n|  | Democratic | W.

In 1999, she was elected to the Mississippi State Senate as a Democrat. She represented the 39th district from 2000 to 2012. In 2010, Hyde-Smith switched parties and became a Republican, citing her conservative beliefs.[3] Hyde-Smith was elected Mississippi agriculture commissioner in 2011, the first woman elected to that office, and reelected in 2015.\n\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Governor Phil Bryant announced his intention to appoint Hyde-Smith to the United States Senate seat being vacated due to the resignation of Thad Cochran.[4] Hyde-Smith was sworn into office on April 9, 2018. She is the first woman to represent Mississippi in Congress.[5] Hyde-Smith was a candidate in the 2018 U.S. Senate special election for the remainder of Cochran's term, which expired in 2021.[6] She finished first in the top-two general election on November 6, 2018, but did not receive more than 50% of the vote, thus advancing to a November 27 special runoff election versus Mike Espy. Hyde-Smith won the runoff election,[7] becoming the first woman elected to Congress from Mississippi.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, the daughter of Lorraine Hyde and Luther Hyde, and grew up in Monticello, Mississippi.[1] She attended Lawrence County Academy in Monticello, a segregation academy established in response to Supreme Court rulings ordering the desegregation of public schools.[9] The school's team nickname was the Rebels; the mascot was a \"Col. Reb\" who carried a Confederate flag.[9][10][11][12]\n\n\nHyde-Smith graduated from Copiah–Lincoln Community College with an Associate of Arts (AA) and the University of Southern Mississippi with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in criminal justice and political science.[13] She is one of the few U.S. senators who attended community college. After her studies, she worked as a lobbyist for the Southern Coalition for Safer Highways and National Coalition for Healthcare, with offices in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.[14][15] She served as the state director for Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee during her time with the National Coalition for Healthcare, which advocated nationwide healthcare coverage.[16]\n\n\n\n## Mississippi Senate[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was a member of the Mississippi Senate, representing the 39th District from 2000 to 2012. For part of her tenure, she chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee, which led her Senate colleagues to encourage her to run for Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce.[17][18] She had a conservative voting record in the state Senate.[19] During her time in the state Senate, 79 of her bills became law.[20] She supported measures to collect DNA samples from people in custody of the Department of Corrections and authored a bill to ban most abortions after 12 weeks. After the abortion restriction bill passed and was signed by then-Governor Haley Barbour, it was overturned in federal court. On the Senate Agriculture Committee, Hyde-Smith also helped manage the fallout from a controversial beef plant that defaulted on a $55 million state loan. The state sued firms involved in the construction of a 400-employee plant in Yalobusha County that closed three months after it opened, in August 2004. The state eventually settled with the plant owners for $4 million.[21] In 2001, Hyde-Smith introduced legislation to name a portion of Highway 51 for Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, who had no ties to the area. The bill died in committee. Hyde-Smith also voted for resolutions honoring civil rights leader Medgar Evers, the Freedom Riders and Hiram Rhodes Revels, who, through legislative appointment during Reconstruction, became the first African American to represent Mississippi in the U.S. Senate.[22] In 2009, Hyde-Smith led an effort to override Barbour's veto of a bill that sought to restrict the power of eminent domain to public use, thereby prohibiting eminent domain for private economic purposes. The bill passed the state House 119-3[23] and the state Senate unanimously.[24] Barbour vetoed the bill on the grounds that the restriction could harm the state's business climate. The legislature attempted to override his veto, but was unsuccessful. In the House, the override vote was successful with a 101–19 vote,[25] but it failed in the Senate, 28–22.[26] Hyde-Smith was critical of senators who switched their vote after the veto, saying, \"Not only could you never come to this podium again and say 'I protect private property rights', you're still gonna have to say 'I changed my vote to vote against private property rights'.\"[27]\n\n\nOn December 28, 2010, Hyde-Smith announced that she had switched her party affiliation from Democratic to Republican.[13][28] Her switch made the Senate equally divided between Republicans and Democrats, with each party holding 26 seats.[19] In 2011, Senator Ezell Lee also switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican, which gave Republicans a 27-25 majority heading into the 2011 elections. This marked the first time since the Reconstruction era in which Republicans held a majority of seats in the chamber.\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith first sought election to the Mississippi Senate in 1999, as she concluded her career as a lobbyist and transitioned back to the state. She returned to Mississippi, gave birth to her daughter, and qualified to run for state Senate all in one year.[29] Her opponent in the 1999 Mississippi Senate Democratic primary was 20-year incumbent W. L. Rayborn. She perceived that Rayborn prioritized his personal interests over his district's and had supported his opponents in the previous two elections. During the campaign, Hyde-Smith refused to criticize him or target specific issues. Rayborn was known for a pet cause—allowing non-dentists to make false teeth. A denturist without a dental degree, he showed up to the Capitol a few days each session adorned with buttons and stickers promoting his bill \"The Freedom of Choice Dentures Act.\" In 1999, his last year in office, it died in committee.[30] Hyde-Smith defeated Rayborn in the Democratic primary and Republican Helen Price and independent Frank Greer in the general election, with 75.36% of the vote.[31]\n\n\nIn the 2003 Democratic primary, Rayborn challenged Hyde-Smith in the newly redrawn state Senate District 39 and lost, 65.47% to 34.53%.[32] Hyde-Smith was unopposed in the general election.\n\n\nIn 2007, Hyde-Smith was unopposed in the Senate District 39 Democratic primary. In the general election, she defeated Republican Edwin V. Case with 79.45% of the vote. This was her last election in the Senate district.[33]\n\n\n\n## Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith as Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce\nIn January 2011, Hyde-Smith announced her candidacy for Mississippi's commissioner of agriculture and commerce.[34] She won the Republican nomination in August[35] and the general election in November, defeating Democratic nominee Joel Gill, to become the first woman to win this position.[36] She took office on January 5, 2012.[37]\n\n\nIn June 2012, in response to a massive infestation of plant bugs in cotton farms throughout the Mississippi Delta (which had caused approximately $81 million in damages), Hyde-Smith said that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had approved an emergency exemption to help farmers exterminate the bugs.[38]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Hyde-Smith successfully pushed for legislation to help fund a big renovation project for the Mississippi Coliseum.[39] In December 2013, she received a Service Award from the Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation for the project.[40]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was reelected in 2015, defeating Democratic nominee Addie Lee Green by over twenty points.[41] She was sworn in for her second term on January 7, 2016.[42] In April 2016, Hyde-Smith announced that the Mississippi Department of Agriculture would be accepting proposals for both the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program and the Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program for the year's federal budget.[43]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Mike Pence swears in Smith at the Old Senate Chamber in 2018\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Governor Phil Bryant announced Hyde-Smith as his choice to fill the United States Senate seat held by Thad Cochran, who indicated he would resign the seat due to health issues.[44] Cochran resigned on April 1, and Bryant formally appointed Hyde-Smith on April 2.[2] Hyde-Smith became the first woman to represent Mississippi in the United States Congress.[45][46] The Senate was in a district work period and was not conducting legislative business at that time, so she did not take the oath of office until the Senate reconvened for legislative business on April 9.[47] At her ceremonial swearing in, Hyde-Smith was accompanied by her husband, Michael, and U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, Orrin Hatch, Lamar Alexander, Chuck Schumer, and Susan Collins.[46] Hyde-Smith announced that she would seek election to the seat in the 2018 special election on November 6.[48]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018 special election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate special election in Mississippi\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly did not support Hyde-Smith's Senate appointment because of her history as a Democrat,[49][50] but in August 2018, Trump endorsed her for election.[51] He stumped for Hyde-Smith in suburban northern Mississippi.[52]\n\n\nIn the 2018 special election, Hyde-Smith was challenged by Republican Chris McDaniel, who criticized her past Democratic affiliation. Hyde-Smith responded that she had \"always been a conservative\" and added that she had the support of Republican Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.[53] She highlighted her support for Second Amendment rights, opposition to abortion, and advocacy for the state's defense business.[54]\n\n\nHyde-Smith declined to debate her Democratic opponent, Mike Espy, before the November 6 special election; Cochran had often done the same.[55] After she and Espy each finished with about 41% of the vote,[56] she agreed to debate Espy on November 20 before the runoff election.[57]\n\n\nDuring the runoff campaign, while appearing with cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson in Tupelo, Mississippi, Hyde-Smith said, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be in the front row.\" The remark immediately drew harsh criticism, given Mississippi's notorious history of lynchings and public executions of African-Americans. In response to the criticism, Hyde-Smith downplayed her comment as \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" and called the backlash \"ridiculous.\"[58][59][60][61][62][63] She refused to apologize.[64][65]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2018, Hyde-Smith joined Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant at a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi, where she was asked repeatedly about her comment by reporters. She repeatedly responded, \"I put out a statement yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about it.\"[66][67] When reporters redirected questions to Bryant, he defended Hyde-Smith's comment and changed the subject to abortion, saying he was \"confused about where the outrage is at about 20 million African American children that have been aborted.\"[68]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2018, Hyde-Smith appeared in a video clip saying that it would be \"a great idea\" to make it more difficult for liberals to vote.[69] Her campaign said Hyde-Smith was obviously joking and that the video was selectively edited. Both this and the \"public hanging\" video were released by Lamar White Jr., a Louisiana blogger and journalist.[70]\n\n\nAlso in November 2018, media reports noted that Hyde-Smith attended a school that was created to avoid court-mandated racial integration and made use of various confederate symbols, and that she sent her daughter to a similar school.[9][71]\n\n\nThe runoff election was held on November 27. Hyde-Smith defeated Espy, 53.9%-46.1%.[72][73]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in Mississippi\n\nIn January 2020, Hyde-Smith filed to run for a full term in the November election.[74] She was renominated unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated Espy again in the general election, by ten percentage points.[75]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyde-Smith during the 115th Congress\n![](image)Hyde-Smith during the 117th Congress\nOn October 6, 2018, Hyde-Smith voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States.[76] On October 26, 2020, she voted to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Court.[77]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Hyde-Smith was participating in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count debate about Arizona's electoral votes when Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. She and other senators were removed from the Senate floor to an undisclosed location shortly after the Capitol was breached. Her staff had to shelter in her office.[78] During the attack, Hyde-Smith tweeted: \"Whatever frustrations any American may have, violence & destruction in the US Capitol, the seat of our democratic government, is unacceptable\".[79] She later said that she was afraid during the storming of the Capitol and called the rioters \"criminals who need to be prosecuted\".[80]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management, and Trade\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch\n\t+ Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water and Power\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith identifies herself as a conservative Republican.[81] From 1999 to 2010, she served in elected office as a Democrat. She voted in the Democratic primary in 2008[82] and described herself as having been a conservative Democrat during her tenure in the state legislature.[83] She switched to the Republican Party in 2010.\n\n\nIn 2012, Hyde-Smith endorsed Republican nominee Mitt Romney for U.S. president.[84]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight reported that as of January 2021, Hyde-Smith had voted in line with Donald Trump's political positions about 92% of the time.[85] It also reported that as of November 2022, she had voted in line with President Joe Biden's political positions about 38.9% of the time.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2021 United States Electoral College vote count[edit]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Hyde-Smith joined four other senators in voting to object to the certification of Arizona's electoral votes.[87] She said she based her decision on \"the erosion of integrity of the electoral process.\" Hyde-Smith added that her constituents \"do not believe the presidential election was constitutional and cannot accept the Electoral College decision.\" Her position differed from that of fellow Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who supported certification.[88] She also voted not to certify Pennsylvania's electoral votes.[89] The *Jackson Free Press* called on Hyde-Smith to \"recant or resign\" for objecting to the certification of Arizona's and Pennsylvania's electoral votes.[90]\n\n\nFollowing the attack on the Capitol, Hyde-Smith did not support invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office. She also said she would not vote to convict Trump in the event of an impeachment trial.[91]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Hyde-Smith voted against creating an independent commission to investigate the 2021 United States Capitol attack.[92]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Hyde-Smith expressed opposition to the For the People Act, which would expand voting rights, falsely claiming that the bill would nullify voter identification laws in Mississippi.[93] She also objected to allowing people to vote on Sunday, which is the Christian Sabbath and a day that black churches coordinate rides to polling places for their parishioners.[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith describes her economic positions as fiscally conservative.[96]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hyde-Smith was one of 29 Republicans who joined all Democrats in opposing Senator Rand Paul's bill to cut federal spending by 1% over five years, known as the Penny Bill.[97] Republican opponents of the bill said it could threaten federal defense and domestic programs.[97] She faced criticism from the bill's supporters.[98]\n\n\nHyde-Smith supported the Trump-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[99] As a state legislator, she voted in favor of increasing unemployment benefits and in favor of raising taxes on cigarettes.[100] She also voted with all Mississippi Democrats in the state legislature to restore funding that had been previously eliminated due to budget cuts.[101]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Hyde-Smith was a cosponsor of the Transporting Livestock Across America Safely Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by Ben Sasse and Jon Tester intended to reform hours of service for livestock haulers by authorizing drivers to rest at any point during their trip without it being counted against their hours of service and exempting loading and unloading times from the hours of service calculation of driving time.[102]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Hyde-Smith was one of eight senators to introduce the Agricultural Trucking Relief Act, a bill that would alter the definition of an agricultural commodity to include both horticultural and aquacultural products and promote greater consistency in regulation through both federal and state agencies as part of an attempt to ease regulatory burdens on trucking and the agri-community.[103]\n\n\nHyde-Smith was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Hyde-Smith co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[105][106]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), saying that it \"has failed Mississippi.\"[107] She is in favor of repealing it but says that she supports keeping provisions ensuring protections for preexisting conditions.[107] While in the Senate, she voted to expand the use of short-term health insurance plans, which can discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.[107]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Hyde-Smith was one of eight senators to cosponsor the Palliative Care and Hospice Education and Training Act (PCHETA), a bill intended to strengthen training for new and existing physicians, people who teach palliative care, and other providers who are on the palliative care team that grants patients and their families a voice in their care and treatment goals.[108]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Hyde-Smith was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hyde-Smith and Brett Kavanaugh in July 2018\nIn March 2019 Hyde-Smith was one of 12 senators to co-sponsor a resolution in favor of a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices. The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to expanding the number of seats on the Supreme Court.[110]\n\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith's 2018 campaign described her as having a \"strong social conservative voting record with a 100 percent pro-life rating [who is] a lifetime member of the NRA.\"[45] Gun Owners of America, which supports gun owners' rights and is in favor of loosening restrictions on guns, gave her a rating of 50% in 2018.[111]\n\n\nHyde-Smith opposes abortion.[112] As a state senator, she authored a bill requiring that all abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy be performed in a hospital or ambulatory surgical facility; the bill was blocked by federal courts.[113] In 2018, she voted with Senate Republicans to prohibit federal funding from being given to any organization or facility that promotes abortion services or family planning.[114] She opposes Planned Parenthood, describing it as \"one of the worst things that has ever happened to us.\"[107]\n\n\nIn 2018 Hyde-Smith released a statement supporting the Trump administration's travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries.[115] Her campaign website says she supports the construction of a wall along the southern US border.[116]\n\n\nIn 2012, as the Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, Hyde-Smith was personally opposed to a same-sex commitment ceremony at the Mississippi Agriculture & Forestry Museum, but instructed the museum to allow it after consulting with Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood. She declared she would seek a change in state law and request from the legislature \"clear and straightforward definitions about what activities can take place on the property owned by the State of Mississippi.\"[117] In November 2022, she voted against the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation that codifies same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[118][119]\n\n\n\n### Confederate States of America[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Hyde-Smith voted for a resolution that praised a Confederate States Army soldier for his efforts to \"defend his homeland\".[120] During her first term in the Mississippi Senate, she proposed renaming a state highway after Confederate President Jefferson Davis, but the legislation did not pass.[121] In 2014, Hyde-Smith posted a photo of herself at Davis's home, Beauvoir, wearing a Confederate cap and carrying a rifle, with the caption \"Mississippi history at its best!\"[120][122]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nOn February 5, 2020, at the first impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Hyde-Smith voted to acquit Trump. He was acquitted.[123]\n\n\nOn February 13, 2021, at Trump's second impeachment trial, Hyde-Smith voted to acquit Trump. He was acquitted.[124]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHyde-Smith is married to a cattle farmer, Mike Smith. They are members of the Macedonia Baptist Church.

A member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), Minnesota's affiliate of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the county attorney of Hennepin County, Minnesota.\n\n\nBorn in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar graduated from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. She was a partner at two Minneapolis law firms before being elected county attorney of Hennepin County in 1998, making her responsible for all criminal prosecution in Minnesota's most populous county. Klobuchar was first elected to the Senate in 2006, succeeding Mark Dayton to become Minnesota's first elected female United States senator. She was reelected by a landslide in 2012, winning 86 of the state's 87 counties. Klobuchar was reelected again in 2018.[1] In 2009 and 2010, she was described as a \"rising star\" in the Democratic Party.[2][3]\n\n\nKlobuchar's political positions align with modern liberalism. She has focused on healthcare reform, consumer protection, agriculture, and climate change. She is known for her folksy, Midwestern demeanor and ability to win in rural Minnesota.[4][5][6]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2019, Klobuchar announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in the 2020 election; on March 2, 2020, she suspended her campaign and endorsed Joe Biden.[7][8] In 2021, she became the chair of the Senate Rules Committee.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and Jim Klobuchar. Her mother taught second grade until she retired at age 70.[9] Her father Jim, a retired sportswriter and columnist for the *Star Tribune*,[10] was of Slovene descent.[11][12]\n\n\nKlobuchar's parents divorced when she was 15. The divorce took a toll on the family; her relationship with her father was not fully restored until he quit drinking in the 1990s.[13]\n\n\nShe attended public schools in Plymouth and was valedictorian at Wayzata High School,[14][15] where she was also class treasurer and secretary.[16] She received her Bachelor of Arts *magna cum laude* in political science in 1982 from Yale University.[17] While at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for then-Vice President and former senator Walter Mondale.[18] Her senior thesis, *Uncovering the Dome*,[19] a 250-page history of the ten years of politics surrounding the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, was published by Waveland Press in 1986. After Yale, Klobuchar enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School, where she served as an associate editor of the *University of Chicago Law Review* and earned her Juris Doctor *magna cum laude* in 1985.[20]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Klobuchar worked as a corporate lawyer.[18] Before seeking public office, besides working as a prosecutor, Klobuchar was a partner at the Minnesota law firms Dorsey & Whitney and Gray Plant Mooty, where she specialized in \"regulatory work in telecommunications law\".[21][22][23] Her first foray into politics came after she gave birth and was forced to leave the hospital 24 hours later, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Klobuchar's daughter, Abigail,[18] was born with a disorder that prevented her from swallowing. The experience led Klobuchar to appear before the Minnesota State Legislature, advocating for a bill that would guarantee new mothers a 48-hour hospital stay. Minnesota passed the bill and President Clinton later made the policy federal law.[18]\n\n\nKlobuchar was first a candidate for public office in 1994 when she ran for Hennepin County attorney. But she had pledged to drop out if the incumbent, Michael Freeman, got back in the race after failing to win the endorsement of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) Party for governor. Keeping this pledge, she quit the race in June 1994 and supported Freeman for reelection.[24] Before running for office, Klobuchar was active in supporting DFL candidates, including Freeman in 1990. The county attorney election is nonpartisan, but Freeman, like Klobuchar, is a Democrat.\n\n\n\n## Hennepin County attorney[edit]\n\n\nKlobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998, running after Freeman declined to seek an additional term.[25][18] In the nonpartisan election, she defeated Republican Sheryl Ramstad Hvass by a margin of less than 1%. Klobuchar was reelected unopposed in 2002.[26]\n\n\nIn 2001, *Minnesota Lawyer* named her \"Attorney of the Year\".[27][28] Klobuchar was president of the Minnesota County Attorneys Association from November 2002 to November 2003.[29]\n\n\nIn 2002, Klobuchar spearheaded an effort that resulted in state laws being altered to allow felony charges to be brought against repeat drunk driving offenders. In 2003, Klobuchar dealt with one of her highest-profile cases when the Hennepin County Attorney's Office brought several charges against former professional baseball player Kirby Puckett related to an alleged sex crime. Puckett was acquitted by a jury of all charges brought against him.[26]\n\n\nKlobuchar took a \"tough-on-crime\" approach. At the time she took office, there was a crime wave in Minneapolis, with the city's murder rate much higher than the national rate. Klobuchar had won election on the slogan \"More Trials, More Convictions\". She pursued heavier sentencing and less favorable plea deals, and sought to bring more cases to trial. By the end of her first year, she had significantly increased the number of cases brought and convictions secured.[30] Under Klobuchar, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office prosecuted people for possession of khat. At the time, it was rare in the United States for prosecutors to pursue prosecution on such charges.[31] Klobuchar also brought felony charges against a number of men for failure to pay child support.[32]\n\n\nKlobuchar pursued tougher sentencing in hopes of deterring crime. For some smaller offenses, such as vandalism, she regularly sought sentences that exceeded the recommended duration. This was true for both adult and minor defendants. For property crime offenders who had already received five convictions, Klobuchar's office similarly pursued longer sentences than had been recommended.[32] Klobuchar declared that she intended to scrutinize judges who were \"letting offenders off the hook too easily\". In 2000, a successful appeal by Klobuchar lengthened by two days a sentence that a judge handed to an immigrant defendant, which placed the defendant at a greatly increased risk of deportation. The judge had delivered had been 364 days. A sentence of 365 days or greater was likely to lead to the defendant's deportation, and the two days that Klobuchar added to the sentence placed the defendant over that threshold. An analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice found that during Klobuchar's tenure, there was a 20% increase in the number of prison inmates in Hennepin County, which the analysis attributed to the harsher sentences Klobuchar sought.[30]\n\n\nDuring Klobuchar's tenure, the preexisting disparity of African Americans imprisoned at a greater rate than white people decreased in severity. But it remained pronounced,[30] at quadruple the national average, per the Vera Institute of Justice.[32]\n\n\nKlobuchar successfully prosecuted teenage defendant Myron Burrell for the 2002 murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards by gunshot. Both Burrell and Edwards were African American. For much of her subsequent career, Klobuchar highlighted this case, framing it both as an example of her toughness on crime as well as an example of her fighting to provide justice for African-American communities affected by gun crime. Burrell remained steadfast in claiming that he was innocent. In late January 2020, during Klobuchar's presidential campaign, the *Associated Press* called attention to flaws in the case against Burrell, and quoted a co-defendant in the trial as having admitted that he, not Burrell, had actually fired the shot that killed Edwards.[33] *APM Reports* also uncovered further consequential flaws with the case against Burrell.[34] Due to these circumstances, his sentence was commuted by the Minnesota Board of Pardons in December 2020.[35]\n\n\nIn 2004, Klobuchar supported the presidential campaign of U.S. senator John Kerry, traveling across Minnesota as a campaign surrogate.[26]\n\n\nKlobuchar did not prosecute any cases related to police brutality.[36] During her tenure, Hennepin County saw 30 recorded police-involved deaths.[37] Some of these deaths resulted in public controversy, but Klobuchar did not bring any charges.[36] As was common practice at the time, especially in Minnesota, to determine whether to bring charges in such instances, Klobuchar relied on grand jury recommendations.[38] Critics of her use of grand juries alleged that it lacked transparency and was perhaps a tactic for Klobuchar to distance herself from responsibility for the decisions made.[30][38] After the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody, renewed attention was brought to Klobuchar's tenure as Hennepin County Attorney. She was retrospectively criticized for not prosecuting police misconduct during her tenure. Attention was also brought to the fact that during Klobuchar's tenure an officer-involved killing had occurred that involved Officer Derek Chauvin, who was murdered Floyd. This killing did not result in prosecution. The killing occurred in October 2006, several months before Klobuchar left office, and a grand jury was empaneled by her successor (Freeman, who returned for a second stint as county attorney). The grand jury did not recommend any charges.[39] This renewed scrutiny arose several months after Klobuchar concluded her presidential campaign, and while reporting had named her as a potential running mate of presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.[40]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Female senators of the 110th Congress, Klobuchar standing, second from the right, January 2007\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nIn early 2005, after U.S. senator Mark Dayton announced that he would not seek reelection in 2006, Klobuchar became an early favorite for the DFL nomination. She had originally planned to run for attorney general of Minnesota, but was persuaded to run for Senate.[26][41] Emily's List endorsed her on September 29, 2005, and Klobuchar won the DFL endorsement on June 9, 2006. She gained the support of the majority of DFL state legislators in Minnesota during the primaries. A poll of DFL state delegates showed Klobuchar beating her then closest opponent, Patty Wetterling, 66% to 15%. In January Wetterling dropped out of the race and endorsed Klobuchar. Former Senate candidate and prominent lawyer Mike Ciresi, who was widely seen as a serious potential DFL candidate, indicated in early February that he would not enter the race; that was viewed as an important boost for Klobuchar.[41]\n\n\nIn the general election Klobuchar faced Republican candidate Mark Kennedy, Independence Party candidate Robert Fitzgerald, Constitution candidate Ben Powers, and Green Party candidate Michael Cavlan. Klobuchar led in the polls throughout the campaign, and won with 58% of the vote to Kennedy's 38% and Fitzgerald's 3%, carrying all but eight of Minnesota's 87 counties. She is the first woman to be elected U.S. senator from Minnesota. (Muriel Humphrey, the state's first female senator and former second lady of the United States, was appointed to fill her husband's unexpired term and not elected.)[42]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Klobuchar's father, Jim, and supporters campaigning for Klobuchar as U.S. senator, Tower, Minnesota, July 4, 2012\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar won a second term in the U.S. Senate, defeating Republican state representative Kurt Bills by a margin of 35 percentage points (65.23% to 30.53%), carrying all but two counties.[43][44]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar ran for a third term and was reelected by a 24-point margin.[45] The Republican nominee was state representative Jim Newberger. The race was not seen as close, with Klobuchar outraising Newberger $9.9 million to $210,066 as of October 17. Klobuchar maintained a double-digit lead in the polls all autumn.[46]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nA September 2009 poll found 58% of Minnesotans approved of the job Klobuchar was doing and 36% disapproved.[47] On March 12, 2010, Rasmussen Reports indicated 67% of Minnesotans approved of the job she was doing. The *Winona Daily News* described her as a \"rare politician who works across the aisle\". Walter Mondale said, \"She has done better in that miserable Senate than most people there.\"[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Klobuchar with Lindsey Graham and John McCain in Latvia in 2016\nAt the end of the 114th Congress in late 2016, Klobuchar had passed more legislation than any other senator.[49] In February 2017 she called for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate ties between Russia and President Donald Trump and his administration. Concern about Trump's ties to Russia increased after reports that his campaign officials had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials before the 2016 United States elections.[50][51] Klobuchar had already signaled her interest in U.S.–Russia relations in December 2016 when she joined Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham on a trip to the Baltic states and Ukraine.[52] She maintained high approval ratings throughout 2017, with an April 2017 *Star Tribune* poll placing her approval rating at 72%.[53] In October 2017 Morning Consult listed Klobuchar among the 10 senators with the highest approval ratings, and a November 2017 KSTP-TV poll put her approval rating at 56%.[54][55] An April 2019 Morning Consult poll found Klobuchar to be the third-most popular sitting senator, with a 58% approval rating and 26% disapproval rating, behind only Vermont senators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy.[56]\n\n\nAccording to the Center for Effective Lawmaking, Klobuchar scored \"above expectations\" with respect to how successful she was at moving significant legislation in the 115th Congress (2017–18).[57]\n\n\nDuring the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings in 2018, Kavanaugh gave heated responses to Klobuchar's questions about whether he had ever experienced memory loss after consuming alcohol, for which he later apologized.[58]\n\n\nIn February 2019, *BuzzFeed News* reported that interviews with former staffers and reviews of emails indicated that Klobuchar frequently abused and humiliated her employees, requiring significant staff time to manage her ire. The article reported that other employees found her to be \"fair and effective\" and a good boss.[59] *Politico* reported that Klobuchar had the highest annual staff turnover rate of any senator—36%—between 2011 and 2016.[60] A *Huffington Post* article alleged she had a reputation for mistreating her staff, with some staff alleging she was prone to bursts of cruelty.[61] In response to the negative reports, 61 former staffers wrote an open letter praising Klobuchar, stating that she was a caring \"mentor and friend\" to them.[62]\n\n\nIn the 115th Congress, she was absent for 0.5% of votes, with two-thirds of the senators missing more votes.[63] In the ongoing 116th Congress (Jan 2019–Jan 2021), during her campaign for president, as of January 2020, she missed 39.1% of votes, making her the 5th most absent member of the Senate.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Klobuchar speaking at the inauguration of Joe Biden\nKlobuchar was at the U.S. Capitol when Trump supporters stormed it on January 6, 2021. As ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, she and Senator Roy Blunt co-led Senate deliberations during the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.[65] She also served as a teller, along with Blunt, Representative Rodney Davis, and Representative Zoe Lofgren.[66] After Senate Republicans, led by Senator Ted Cruz, objected to certifying Arizona's electoral votes, Klobuchar participated in the debate on the Senate floor. Shortly after she gave her remarks, the Capitol was breached.[67] As the Senate adjourned, Klobuchar was alerted on her phone that shots were fired inside the Capitol, which she announced to those present.[68] Immediately, Klobuchar, fellow senators, staff and journalists were evacuated from the chambers to a secure location.[68][69] When the Capitol was secure, Congress reconvened and the election count was certified in the early morning of January 7. Klobuchar supported the certification. Later that day, Klobuchar said she supported the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office \"because you cannot have a president basically leading an insurrection against our own country's government.\"[70] She also called for investigations into the breach.[71]\n\n\nKlobuchar was the first speaker at Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### 117th Congress[edit]\n\n\nIn the 117th Congress, Klobuchar serves on the following standing committees:\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry[74]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources[75]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research[75]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy[75]\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation[76]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband[77]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security[78]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freight, and Ports[79]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion[80]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights (chair)[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law[81]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration (chair)[82]\n* Joint Committee on the Library (ex officio)[83]\n* Joint Committee on Printing (ex officio)[84]\n* Joint Economic Committee[85]\n\n\n#### 116th Congress[edit]\n\n\nIn the 116th Congress, Klobuchar served on the following standing committees:[86]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry[87][88]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Marketing and Agriculture Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy\n* Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation[89]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Security\n* Committee on the Judiciary[90]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights (ranking member)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism\n\t+ Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights, and Federal Courts\n* Committee on Rules and Administration (ranking member)[91]\n* Joint Committee on the Library (ex officio)[83]\n* Joint Committee on Printing (ex officio)[84]\n* Joint Economic Committee[92]\n\n\n#### Other Congresses[edit]\n\n\nIn her first Congress, the 110th Congress, Klobuchar was assigned to the following committees:[93]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n* Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works\n* Joint Economic Committee\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[94]\n\n\n### Role in the Democratic Party[edit]\n\n\nOn March 30, 2008, Klobuchar announced her endorsement of Senator Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primary, promising her superdelegate vote to him.[95] She cited his performance in the Minnesota caucuses, where he won with 66% of the popular vote, as well as her own \"independent judgment\". In 2016 she was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton's second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.[96]\n\n\nKlobuchar has served as the chair of the U.S. Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee since 2015.[97] She became the steering chair of the committee in 2017, with Bernie Sanders as the outreach chair.[98] Both represented the Democratic Party in a 2017 televised debate on healthcare policy and the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act on CNN.[99]\n\n\nIn 2020, Klobuchar was speculated to be a possible candidate for secretary of agriculture or United States attorney general in the Biden administration.[100]\n\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Klobuchar 2020 presidential campaign\n\n![](image)Klobuchar (center) with her husband and daughter at her campaign announcement\n*The New York Times* and *The New Yorker* named Klobuchar as one of the women most likely to become the first female president of the United States,[101][102] and MSNBC and *The New Yorker* named her as a possible nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.[103][104]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2019, Klobuchar announced her candidacy in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[105] She has said that she uses humor as one way to distinguish herself among the many other Democratic candidates in the 2020 campaign.[106]\n\n\nOn January 19, 2020, *The New York Times* editorial board endorsed Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren for president.[107][108]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the day before Super Tuesday, Klobuchar suspended her campaign and endorsed Joe Biden.[109]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2020, it was reported that Biden asked several women, including Klobuchar, to undergo formal vetting for consideration as his vice-presidential running mate.[110][111] On June 18, Klobuchar withdrew herself from consideration, saying that Biden should choose a woman of color.[112]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Amy Klobuchar\n\nKlobuchar's political positions have generally been in line with modern American liberalism. She is pro-choice on abortion, supports LGBT rights and the Affordable Care Act, and was critical of the Iraq War. During the 115th Congress, she voted in line with President Donald Trump's position on legislation 31.1 percent of the time.[113]\n\n\nAccording to GovTrack, Klobuchar passed more legislation than any other senator by the end of the 114th Congress in late 2016.[49] According to Congress.gov, as of December 16, 2018[update], she had sponsored or co-sponsored 111 pieces of legislation that became law.[114]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, Klobuchar married John Bessler, a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. They have a daughter who graduated from Yale University and worked as a legislative director for New York councilman Keith Powers.[18][115]\n\n\nKlobuchar is a member of the United Church of Christ[116] and is a cousin of musician Zola Jesus.[117][118]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Klobuchar revealed that she had been diagnosed with Stage 1A breast cancer in February 2021, that she had undergone a successful lumpectomy, and that in May she had completed a course of radiation treatment. In August, her doctors determined that the treatments had all been successful and she was cancer-free.[119]\n\n\nKlobuchar's grandparents were immigrants from Slovenia's White Carniola region. Her paternal grandfather was a miner on Minnesota's Iron Range.[11][12] Amy's maternal grandparents emigrated from Switzerland to the United States.[120]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### Hennepin County attorney[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1998 Hennepin County attorney election[121]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Nonpartisan | **Amy Klobuchar** | 223,416\n | 50.3%\n |  |\n|  | Nonpartisan | Sheryl Ramstad Hvass\n | 219,676\n | 49.4%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\n2002 Hennepin County attorney election[122]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Nonpartisan | **Amy Klobuchar** | 380,632\n | 98.7%\n |  |\n|  |  | Write-in\n | 4,829\n | 1.3%\n |  |\n\n\n### U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n*Note: The ±% column reflects the change in total number of votes won by each party from the previous election.*\n\n\n\n\n\n2006 United States Senate Democratic–Farmer–Labor primary election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Amy Klobuchar**  | **294,671**  | **92.5%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Darryl Stanton\n | 23,872\n | 7.5%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\n2006 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Amy Klobuchar**  | **1,278,849**  | **58.1%**  | **+9.2%**  |\n|  | Republican | Mark Kennedy | 835,653\n | 37.9%\n | -5.4%\n |\n|  | Independence | Robert Fitzgerald\n | 71,194\n | 3.2%\n | -2.6%\n |\n|  | Green | Michael Cavlan\n | 10,714\n | 0.5%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Constitution | Ben Powers\n | 5,408\n | 0.3%\n | -0.1%\n |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 954\n |  |  |\n| Majority\n | 443,196\n | 20.2%\n |  |\n| Turnout | 2,202,772\n | 70.6%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2012 United States Senate Democratic–Farmer–Labor primary election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Amy Klobuchar**  | **183,766**  | **90.8%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Dick Franson\n | 6,837\n | 3.4%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Jack Edward Shepard\n | 6,632\n | 3.3%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Darryl Stanton\n | 5,155\n | 2.6%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\n2012 United States Senate election in Minnesota[123]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Amy Klobuchar (incumbent)\n | 1,854,595\n | 65.2%\n | +7.1%\n |\n|  | Republican | Kurt Bills\n | 867,974\n | 30.5%\n | -7.3%\n |\n|  | Independence | Stephen Williams\n | 73,539\n | 2.6%\n | -0.6%\n |\n|  | Grassroots | Tim Davis\n | 30,531\n | 1.1%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Minnesota Open Progressive Party | Michael Cavlan\n | 13,986\n | 0.5%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 2,582\n |  |  |\n| Majority\n | 986,621\n | 34.6%\n | +14.4%\n |\n| Turnout | 2,843,207\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2018 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Amy Klobuchar (incumbent)\n | 1,566,174\n | 60.3%\n | -4.9%\n |\n|  | Republican | Jim Newberger\n | 940,437\n | 36.2%\n | +5.7%\n |\n|  | Legal Marijuana Now | Dennis Schuller\n | 66,236\n | 2.6%\n | +2.6%\n |\n|  | Green | Paula Overby\n | 23,101\n | 0.9%\n | +0.9%\n |\n| Majority\n | 625,737\n | 24.1%\n | -10.5%\n |\n| Turnout | 2,595,948\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) *After Words* interview with Amy Klobuchar on *The Senator Next Door*, September 12, 2015, C-SPAN |\n\n\nKlobuchar has written four books.

A member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), Minnesota's affiliate of the Democratic Party, she previously served as the county attorney of Hennepin County, Minnesota.\n\n\nBorn in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar graduated from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law School. She was a partner at two Minneapolis law firms before being elected county attorney of Hennepin County in 1998, making her responsible for all criminal prosecution in Minnesota's most populous county. Klobuchar was first elected to the Senate in 2006, succeeding Mark Dayton to become Minnesota's first elected female United States senator. She was reelected by a landslide in 2012, winning 86 of the state's 87 counties. Klobuchar was reelected again in 2018.[1] In 2009 and 2010, she was described as a \"rising star\" in the Democratic Party.[2][3]\n\n\nKlobuchar's political positions align with modern liberalism. She has focused on healthcare reform, consumer protection, agriculture, and climate change. She is known for her folksy, Midwestern demeanor and ability to win in rural Minnesota.[4][5][6]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2019, Klobuchar announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in the 2020 election; on March 2, 2020, she suspended her campaign and endorsed Joe Biden.[7][8] In 2021, she became the chair of the Senate Rules Committee.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Plymouth, Minnesota, Klobuchar is the daughter of Rose (née Heuberger) and Jim Klobuchar. Her mother taught second grade until she retired at age 70.[9] Her father Jim, a retired sportswriter and columnist for the *Star Tribune*,[10] was of Slovene descent.[11][12]\n\n\nKlobuchar's parents divorced when she was 15. The divorce took a toll on the family; her relationship with her father was not fully restored until he quit drinking in the 1990s.[13]\n\n\nShe attended public schools in Plymouth and was valedictorian at Wayzata High School,[14][15] where she was also class treasurer and secretary.[16] She received her Bachelor of Arts *magna cum laude* in political science in 1982 from Yale University.[17] While at Yale, Klobuchar spent time as an intern for then-Vice President and former senator Walter Mondale.[18] Her senior thesis, *Uncovering the Dome*,[19] a 250-page history of the ten years of politics surrounding the building of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, was published by Waveland Press in 1986. After Yale, Klobuchar enrolled at the University of Chicago Law School, where she served as an associate editor of the *University of Chicago Law Review* and earned her Juris Doctor *magna cum laude* in 1985.[20]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Klobuchar worked as a corporate lawyer.[18] Before seeking public office, besides working as a prosecutor, Klobuchar was a partner at the Minnesota law firms Dorsey & Whitney and Gray Plant Mooty, where she specialized in \"regulatory work in telecommunications law\".[21][22][23] Her first foray into politics came after she gave birth and was forced to leave the hospital 24 hours later, a situation exacerbated by the fact that Klobuchar's daughter, Abigail,[18] was born with a disorder that prevented her from swallowing. The experience led Klobuchar to appear before the Minnesota State Legislature, advocating for a bill that would guarantee new mothers a 48-hour hospital stay. Minnesota passed the bill and President Clinton later made the policy federal law.[18]\n\n\nKlobuchar was first a candidate for public office in 1994 when she ran for Hennepin County attorney. But she had pledged to drop out if the incumbent, Michael Freeman, got back in the race after failing to win the endorsement of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor (DFL) Party for governor. Keeping this pledge, she quit the race in June 1994 and supported Freeman for reelection.[24] Before running for office, Klobuchar was active in supporting DFL candidates, including Freeman in 1990. The county attorney election is nonpartisan, but Freeman, like Klobuchar, is a Democrat.\n\n\n\n## Hennepin County attorney[edit]\n\n\nKlobuchar was elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998, running after Freeman declined to seek an additional term.[25][18] In the nonpartisan election, she defeated Republican Sheryl Ramstad Hvass by a margin of less than 1%. Klobuchar was reelected unopposed in 2002.[26]\n\n\nIn 2001, *Minnesota Lawyer* named her \"Attorney of the Year\".[27][28] Klobuchar was president of the Minnesota County Attorneys Association from November 2002 to November 2003.[29]\n\n\nIn 2002, Klobuchar spearheaded an effort that resulted in state laws being altered to allow felony charges to be brought against repeat drunk driving offenders. In 2003, Klobuchar dealt with one of her highest-profile cases when the Hennepin County Attorney's Office brought several charges against former professional baseball player Kirby Puckett related to an alleged sex crime. Puckett was acquitted by a jury of all charges brought against him.[26]\n\n\nKlobuchar took a \"tough-on-crime\" approach. At the time she took office, there was a crime wave in Minneapolis, with the city's murder rate much higher than the national rate. Klobuchar had won election on the slogan \"More Trials, More Convictions\". She pursued heavier sentencing and less favorable plea deals, and sought to bring more cases to trial. By the end of her first year, she had significantly increased the number of cases brought and convictions secured.[30] Under Klobuchar, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office prosecuted people for possession of khat. At the time, it was rare in the United States for prosecutors to pursue prosecution on such charges.[31] Klobuchar also brought felony charges against a number of men for failure to pay child support.[32]\n\n\nKlobuchar pursued tougher sentencing in hopes of deterring crime. For some smaller offenses, such as vandalism, she regularly sought sentences that exceeded the recommended duration. This was true for both adult and minor defendants. For property crime offenders who had already received five convictions, Klobuchar's office similarly pursued longer sentences than had been recommended.[32] Klobuchar declared that she intended to scrutinize judges who were \"letting offenders off the hook too easily\". In 2000, a successful appeal by Klobuchar lengthened by two days a sentence that a judge handed to an immigrant defendant, which placed the defendant at a greatly increased risk of deportation. The judge had delivered had been 364 days. A sentence of 365 days or greater was likely to lead to the defendant's deportation, and the two days that Klobuchar added to the sentence placed the defendant over that threshold. An analysis by the Vera Institute of Justice found that during Klobuchar's tenure, there was a 20% increase in the number of prison inmates in Hennepin County, which the analysis attributed to the harsher sentences Klobuchar sought.[30]\n\n\nDuring Klobuchar's tenure, the preexisting disparity of African Americans imprisoned at a greater rate than white people decreased in severity. But it remained pronounced,[30] at quadruple the national average, per the Vera Institute of Justice.[32]\n\n\nKlobuchar successfully prosecuted teenage defendant Myron Burrell for the 2002 murder of 11-year-old Tyesha Edwards by gunshot. Both Burrell and Edwards were African American. For much of her subsequent career, Klobuchar highlighted this case, framing it both as an example of her toughness on crime as well as an example of her fighting to provide justice for African-American communities affected by gun crime. Burrell remained steadfast in claiming that he was innocent. In late January 2020, during Klobuchar's presidential campaign, the *Associated Press* called attention to flaws in the case against Burrell, and quoted a co-defendant in the trial as having admitted that he, not Burrell, had actually fired the shot that killed Edwards.[33] *APM Reports* also uncovered further consequential flaws with the case against Burrell.[34] Due to these circumstances, his sentence was commuted by the Minnesota Board of Pardons in December 2020.[35]\n\n\nIn 2004, Klobuchar supported the presidential campaign of U.S. senator John Kerry, traveling across Minnesota as a campaign surrogate.[26]\n\n\nKlobuchar did not prosecute any cases related to police brutality.[36] During her tenure, Hennepin County saw 30 recorded police-involved deaths.[37] Some of these deaths resulted in public controversy, but Klobuchar did not bring any charges.[36] As was common practice at the time, especially in Minnesota, to determine whether to bring charges in such instances, Klobuchar relied on grand jury recommendations.[38] Critics of her use of grand juries alleged that it lacked transparency and was perhaps a tactic for Klobuchar to distance herself from responsibility for the decisions made.[30][38] After the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody, renewed attention was brought to Klobuchar's tenure as Hennepin County Attorney. She was retrospectively criticized for not prosecuting police misconduct during her tenure. Attention was also brought to the fact that during Klobuchar's tenure an officer-involved killing had occurred that involved Officer Derek Chauvin, who was murdered Floyd. This killing did not result in prosecution. The killing occurred in October 2006, several months before Klobuchar left office, and a grand jury was empaneled by her successor (Freeman, who returned for a second stint as county attorney). The grand jury did not recommend any charges.[39] This renewed scrutiny arose several months after Klobuchar concluded her presidential campaign, and while reporting had named her as a potential running mate of presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden.[40]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Female senators of the 110th Congress, Klobuchar standing, second from the right, January 2007\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nIn early 2005, after U.S. senator Mark Dayton announced that he would not seek reelection in 2006, Klobuchar became an early favorite for the DFL nomination. She had originally planned to run for attorney general of Minnesota, but was persuaded to run for Senate.[26][41] Emily's List endorsed her on September 29, 2005, and Klobuchar won the DFL endorsement on June 9, 2006. She gained the support of the majority of DFL state legislators in Minnesota during the primaries. A poll of DFL state delegates showed Klobuchar beating her then closest opponent, Patty Wetterling, 66% to 15%. In January Wetterling dropped out of the race and endorsed Klobuchar. Former Senate candidate and prominent lawyer Mike Ciresi, who was widely seen as a serious potential DFL candidate, indicated in early February that he would not enter the race; that was viewed as an important boost for Klobuchar.[41]\n\n\nIn the general election Klobuchar faced Republican candidate Mark Kennedy, Independence Party candidate Robert Fitzgerald, Constitution candidate Ben Powers, and Green Party candidate Michael Cavlan. Klobuchar led in the polls throughout the campaign, and won with 58% of the vote to Kennedy's 38% and Fitzgerald's 3%, carrying all but eight of Minnesota's 87 counties. She is the first woman to be elected U.S. senator from Minnesota. (Muriel Humphrey, the state's first female senator and former second lady of the United States, was appointed to fill her husband's unexpired term and not elected.)[42]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Klobuchar's father, Jim, and supporters campaigning for Klobuchar as U.S. senator, Tower, Minnesota, July 4, 2012\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar won a second term in the U.S. Senate, defeating Republican state representative Kurt Bills by a margin of 35 percentage points (65.23% to 30.53%), carrying all but two counties.[43][44]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nKlobuchar ran for a third term and was reelected by a 24-point margin.[45] The Republican nominee was state representative Jim Newberger. The race was not seen as close, with Klobuchar outraising Newberger $9.9 million to $210,066 as of October 17. Klobuchar maintained a double-digit lead in the polls all autumn.[46]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nA September 2009 poll found 58% of Minnesotans approved of the job Klobuchar was doing and 36% disapproved.[47] On March 12, 2010, Rasmussen Reports indicated 67% of Minnesotans approved of the job she was doing. The *Winona Daily News* described her as a \"rare politician who works across the aisle\". Walter Mondale said, \"She has done better in that miserable Senate than most people there.\"[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Klobuchar with Lindsey Graham and John McCain in Latvia in 2016\nAt the end of the 114th Congress in late 2016, Klobuchar had passed more legislation than any other senator.[49] In February 2017 she called for an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate ties between Russia and President Donald Trump and his administration. Concern about Trump's ties to Russia increased after reports that his campaign officials had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials before the 2016 United States elections.[50][51] Klobuchar had already signaled her interest in U.S.–Russia relations in December 2016 when she joined Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham on a trip to the Baltic states and Ukraine.[52] She maintained high approval ratings throughout 2017, with an April 2017 *Star Tribune* poll placing her approval rating at 72%.[53] In October 2017 Morning Consult listed Klobuchar among the 10 senators with the highest approval ratings, and a November 2017 KSTP-TV poll put her approval rating at 56%.[54][55] An April 2019 Morning Consult poll found Klobuchar to be the third-most popular sitting senator, with a 58% approval rating and 26% disapproval rating, behind only Vermont senators Bernie Sanders and Patrick Leahy.[56]\n\n\nAccording to the Center for Effective Lawmaking, Klobuchar scored \"above expectations\" with respect to how successful she was at moving significant legislation in the 115th Congress (2017–18).[57]\n\n\nDuring the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination hearings in 2018, Kavanaugh gave heated responses to Klobuchar's questions about whether he had ever experienced memory loss after consuming alcohol, for which he later apologized.[58]\n\n\nIn February 2019, *BuzzFeed News* reported that interviews with former staffers and reviews of emails indicated that Klobuchar frequently abused and humiliated her employees, requiring significant staff time to manage her ire. The article reported that other employees found her to be \"fair and effective\" and a good boss.[59] *Politico* reported that Klobuchar had the highest annual staff turnover rate of any senator—36%—between 2011 and 2016.[60] A *Huffington Post* article alleged she had a reputation for mistreating her staff, with some staff alleging she was prone to bursts of cruelty.[61] In response to the negative reports, 61 former staffers wrote an open letter praising Klobuchar, stating that she was a caring \"mentor and friend\" to them.[62]\n\n\nIn the 115th Congress, she was absent for 0.5% of votes, with two-thirds of the senators missing more votes.[63] In the ongoing 116th Congress (Jan 2019–Jan 2021), during her campaign for president, as of January 2020, she missed 39.1% of votes, making her the 5th most absent member of the Senate.[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Klobuchar speaking at the inauguration of Joe Biden\nKlobuchar was at the U.S. Capitol when Trump supporters stormed it on January 6, 2021. As ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, she and Senator Roy Blunt co-led Senate deliberations during the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count.[65] She also served as a teller, along with Blunt, Representative Rodney Davis, and Representative Zoe Lofgren.[66] After Senate Republicans, led by Senator Ted Cruz, objected to certifying Arizona's electoral votes, Klobuchar participated in the debate on the Senate floor. Shortly after she gave her remarks, the Capitol was breached.[67] As the Senate adjourned, Klobuchar was alerted on her phone that shots were fired inside the Capitol, which she announced to those present.[68] Immediately, Klobuchar, fellow senators, staff and journalists were evacuated from the chambers to a secure location.[68][69] When the Capitol was secure, Congress reconvened and the election count was certified in the early morning of January 7. Klobuchar supported the certification. Later that day, Klobuchar said she supported the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to remove Trump from office \"because you cannot have a president basically leading an insurrection against our own country's government.\"[70] She also called for investigations into the breach.[71]\n\n\nKlobuchar was the first speaker at Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20, 2021.[72][73]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### 117th Congress[edit]\n\n\nIn the 117th Congress, Klobuchar serves on the following standing committees:\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry[74]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Climate, Forestry, and Natural Resources[75]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research[75]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy[75]\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation[76]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband[77]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security[78]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation, Maritime, Freight, and Ports[79]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion[80]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights (chair)[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Counterterrorism[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety[81]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology, and the Law[81]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration (chair)[82]\n* Joint Committee on the Library (ex officio)[83]\n* Joint Committee on Printing (ex officio)[84]\n* Joint Economic Committee[85]\n\n\n#### 116th Congress[edit]\n\n\nIn the 116th Congress, Klobuchar served on the following standing committees:[86]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry[87][88]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Conservation, Forestry and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Marketing and Agriculture Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy\n* Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation[89]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation and Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Security\n* Committee on the Judiciary[90]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights (ranking member)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism\n\t+ Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights, and Federal Courts\n* Committee on Rules and Administration (ranking member)[91]\n* Joint Committee on the Library (ex officio)[83]\n* Joint Committee on Printing (ex officio)[84]\n* Joint Economic Committee[92]\n\n\n#### Other Congresses[edit]\n\n\nIn her first Congress, the 110th Congress, Klobuchar was assigned to the following committees:[93]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n* Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works\n* Joint Economic Committee\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[94]\n\n\n### Role in the Democratic Party[edit]\n\n\nOn March 30, 2008, Klobuchar announced her endorsement of Senator Barack Obama in the Democratic presidential primary, promising her superdelegate vote to him.[95] She cited his performance in the Minnesota caucuses, where he won with 66% of the popular vote, as well as her own \"independent judgment\". In 2016 she was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton's second campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.[96]\n\n\nKlobuchar has served as the chair of the U.S. Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee since 2015.[97] She became the steering chair of the committee in 2017, with Bernie Sanders as the outreach chair.[98] Both represented the Democratic Party in a 2017 televised debate on healthcare policy and the possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act on CNN.[99]\n\n\nIn 2020, Klobuchar was speculated to be a possible candidate for secretary of agriculture or United States attorney general in the Biden administration.[100]\n\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Klobuchar 2020 presidential campaign\n\n![](image)Klobuchar (center) with her husband and daughter at her campaign announcement\n*The New York Times* and *The New Yorker* named Klobuchar as one of the women most likely to become the first female president of the United States,[101][102] and MSNBC and *The New Yorker* named her as a possible nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.[103][104]\n\n\nOn February 10, 2019, Klobuchar announced her candidacy in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[105] She has said that she uses humor as one way to distinguish herself among the many other Democratic candidates in the 2020 campaign.[106]\n\n\nOn January 19, 2020, *The New York Times* editorial board endorsed Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren for president.[107][108]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the day before Super Tuesday, Klobuchar suspended her campaign and endorsed Joe Biden.[109]\n\n\nOn May 21, 2020, it was reported that Biden asked several women, including Klobuchar, to undergo formal vetting for consideration as his vice-presidential running mate.[110][111] On June 18, Klobuchar withdrew herself from consideration, saying that Biden should choose a woman of color.[112]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Amy Klobuchar\n\nKlobuchar's political positions have generally been in line with modern American liberalism. She is pro-choice on abortion, supports LGBT rights and the Affordable Care Act, and was critical of the Iraq War. During the 115th Congress, she voted in line with President Donald Trump's position on legislation 31.1 percent of the time.[113]\n\n\nAccording to GovTrack, Klobuchar passed more legislation than any other senator by the end of the 114th Congress in late 2016.[49] According to Congress.gov, as of December 16, 2018[update], she had sponsored or co-sponsored 111 pieces of legislation that became law.[114]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993, Klobuchar married John Bessler, a private practice attorney and a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law. They have a daughter who graduated from Yale University and worked as a legislative director for New York councilman Keith Powers.[18][115]\n\n\nKlobuchar is a member of the United Church of Christ[116] and is a cousin of musician Zola Jesus.[117][118]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Klobuchar revealed that she had been diagnosed with Stage 1A breast cancer in February 2021, that she had undergone a successful lumpectomy, and that in May she had completed a course of radiation treatment. In August, her doctors determined that the treatments had all been successful and she was cancer-free.[119]\n\n\nKlobuchar's grandparents were immigrants from Slovenia's White Carniola region. Her paternal grandfather was a miner on Minnesota's Iron Range.[11][12] Amy's maternal grandparents emigrated from Switzerland to the United States.[120]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### Hennepin County attorney[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1998 Hennepin County attorney election[121]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Nonpartisan | **Amy Klobuchar** | 223,416\n | 50.3%\n |  |\n|  | Nonpartisan | Sheryl Ramstad Hvass\n | 219,676\n | 49.4%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\n2002 Hennepin County attorney election[122]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Nonpartisan | **Amy Klobuchar** | 380,632\n | 98.7%\n |  |\n|  |  | Write-in\n | 4,829\n | 1.3%\n |  |\n\n\n### U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n*Note: The ±% column reflects the change in total number of votes won by each party from the previous election.*\n\n\n\n\n\n2006 United States Senate Democratic–Farmer–Labor primary election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Amy Klobuchar**  | **294,671**  | **92.5%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Darryl Stanton\n | 23,872\n | 7.5%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\n2006 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Amy Klobuchar**  | **1,278,849**  | **58.1%**  | **+9.2%**  |\n|  | Republican | Mark Kennedy | 835,653\n | 37.9%\n | -5.4%\n |\n|  | Independence | Robert Fitzgerald\n | 71,194\n | 3.2%\n | -2.6%\n |\n|  | Green | Michael Cavlan\n | 10,714\n | 0.5%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Constitution | Ben Powers\n | 5,408\n | 0.3%\n | -0.1%\n |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 954\n |  |  |\n| Majority\n | 443,196\n | 20.2%\n |  |\n| Turnout | 2,202,772\n | 70.6%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2012 United States Senate Democratic–Farmer–Labor primary election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Amy Klobuchar**  | **183,766**  | **90.8%**  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Dick Franson\n | 6,837\n | 3.4%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Jack Edward Shepard\n | 6,632\n | 3.3%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Darryl Stanton\n | 5,155\n | 2.6%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\n2012 United States Senate election in Minnesota[123]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Amy Klobuchar (incumbent)\n | 1,854,595\n | 65.2%\n | +7.1%\n |\n|  | Republican | Kurt Bills\n | 867,974\n | 30.5%\n | -7.3%\n |\n|  | Independence | Stephen Williams\n | 73,539\n | 2.6%\n | -0.6%\n |\n|  | Grassroots | Tim Davis\n | 30,531\n | 1.1%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Minnesota Open Progressive Party | Michael Cavlan\n | 13,986\n | 0.5%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 2,582\n |  |  |\n| Majority\n | 986,621\n | 34.6%\n | +14.4%\n |\n| Turnout | 2,843,207\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n\n\n2018 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Amy Klobuchar (incumbent)\n | 1,566,174\n | 60.3%\n | -4.9%\n |\n|  | Republican | Jim Newberger\n | 940,437\n | 36.2%\n | +5.7%\n |\n|  | Legal Marijuana Now | Dennis Schuller\n | 66,236\n | 2.6%\n | +2.6%\n |\n|  | Green | Paula Overby\n | 23,101\n | 0.9%\n | +0.9%\n |\n| Majority\n | 625,737\n | 24.1%\n | -10.5%\n |\n| Turnout | 2,595,948\n |  |  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** | Swing |  |  |\n\n\n## Books[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) *After Words* interview with Amy Klobuchar on *The Senator Next Door*, September 12, 2015, C-SPAN |\n\n\nKlobuchar has written four books.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was a regent of the University of California system from 2018 to 2021, and the president of EMILY's List from 2021 to 2023. \n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom chose Butler to fill the United States Senate seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein. She is the first LGBT African American to serve in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nButler was born on May 11, 1979, in Magnolia, Mississippi, the youngest of three children. Her father died of heart disease when Butler was 16 years old. She graduated as a salutatorian from South Pike High School in 1997.[1][2][3] Butler earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Jackson State University in 2001.[1][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler (center) with State Assemblymembers Jimmy Gomez, Bonnie Lowenthal, John Pérez, and Susan Eggman in 2013\nButler began her career as a union organizer for nurses in Baltimore and Milwaukee, janitors in Philadelphia, and hospital workers in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2009, she moved to California, where she organized in-home caregivers and nurses and served as president of SEIU United Long Term Care Workers, SEIU Local 2015.[4][5][6] Butler was elected president of the California SEIU State Council in 2013. She undertook efforts to boost California's minimum wage and raise income taxes on the wealthiest Californians.[4] As president of SEIU Local 2015, Butler endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.[7] Butler was one of California's electors who voted for Clinton in the 2016 election.[8]\n\n\nIn 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Butler to a 12-year term as a regent of the University of California.[6] She resigned from her role as regent in 2021.[9]\n\n\nButler joined SCRB Strategies, a California-based political-consulting firm, as a partner in 2018. At SCRB, she played a central role in Kamala Harris's 2020 presidential campaign. She has been a political ally of Harris's since the latter's first run for California Attorney General in 2010, when she helped Harris negotiate a shared SEIU endorsement in the race.[4][10] Butler advised Uber in its dealings with organized labor while at SCRB,[11] at a time when Uber was attempting to stop state legislation from classifying its drivers as employees.[12] The *New York Times* reported that Butler \"advised Uber on how to deal with unions like the Teamsters and S.E.I.U., and sat in on several face-to-face meetings between the gig companies and union representatives\".[13] Butler left SCRB in 2020 to join Airbnb as director of public policy and campaigns in North America.[14][5]\n\n\nIn 2021, Butler was named the third president of EMILY's List. She was the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization.[15][4] In February 2022, Butler joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Old Senate Chamber in 2023\nIn February 2023, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she would not run for a sixth full term in the Senate in 2024. On September 29, 2023, she died at the age of 90. At the time of Feinstein's death, several prominent candidates had already announced campaigns for her seat, including U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously pledged to nominate a black woman to the office.[18]\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Newsom chose Butler to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Feinstein's death, fulfilling his pledge to appoint a black woman.[19][20] Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had moved to Maryland in 2021.[21] The United States Constitution requires only that senators be \"inhabitants\" of the state they represent.[21] Newsom's office said that Butler would re-register to vote in California before taking office as a senator.[22] Shortly before nominating Butler, Newsom announced that his nominee would be free to run in 2024 if they chose,[23] a departure from his previous position.[24] On October 19, 2023, Butler announced she would not seek election to a full term in 2024.[25]\n\n\nButler became the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and its first black LGBT member, and was sworn in on October 3, 2023.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[28]\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs[28]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[28]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration[28]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Black Caucus[29]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is a lesbian, and she and her wife, Neneki Lee, have a daughter.[30] They moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2021 when she assumed the presidency of EMILY's List,[31][32] while continuing to own a home in View Park, California, in Los Angeles County.[33] In October 2023, when Newsom appointed her to the Senate, she officially re-domiciled to that home and re-registered to vote in California.[33]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States senators\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Initial Page\". *Senator Butler*.

She was the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization.[15][4] In February 2022, Butler joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Old Senate Chamber in 2023\nIn February 2023, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she would not run for a sixth full term in the Senate in 2024. On September 29, 2023, she died at the age of 90. At the time of Feinstein's death, several prominent candidates had already announced campaigns for her seat, including U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously pledged to nominate a black woman to the office.[18]\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Newsom chose Butler to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Feinstein's death, fulfilling his pledge to appoint a black woman.[19][20] Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had moved to Maryland in 2021.[21] The United States Constitution requires only that senators be \"inhabitants\" of the state they represent.[21] Newsom's office said that Butler would re-register to vote in California before taking office as a senator.[22] Shortly before nominating Butler, Newsom announced that his nominee would be free to run in 2024 if they chose,[23] a departure from his previous position.[24] On October 19, 2023, Butler announced she would not seek election to a full term in 2024.[25]\n\n\nButler became the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and its first black LGBT member, and was sworn in on October 3, 2023.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[28]\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs[28]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[28]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration[28]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Black Caucus[29]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is a lesbian, and she and her wife, Neneki Lee, have a daughter.[30] They moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2021 when she assumed the presidency of EMILY's List,[31][32] while continuing to own a home in View Park, California, in Los Angeles County.[33] In October 2023, when Newsom appointed her to the Senate, she officially re-domiciled to that home and re-registered to vote in California.[33]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States senators\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Initial Page\". *Senator Butler*.

A member of the Democratic Party, she became the state's first female U.S. senator after winning the 2000 election. \n\n\nBefore her election to the Senate, Stabenow was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 8th congressional district from 1997 to 2001. Previously, she served on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners and in the Michigan State Legislature.\n\n\nStabenow was reelected to Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018. She became the state's senior U.S. senator upon Carl Levin's retirement in 2015. Stabenow chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2011 to 2015 and again since 2021. She became chair of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee in 2017. At the start of the 118th Congress, Stabenow became the dean of the Michigan congressional delegation, upon the retirement of Representative Fred Upton. In January 2023, she announced that she would not seek reelection in 2024.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early career[edit]\n\n\nStabenow was born in Gladwin, Michigan, the daughter of Anna Merle (née Hallmark) and Robert Lee Greer.[3] She grew up in Clare, Michigan. She graduated from Clare High School, where she was president of her junior class, the first female class president at the school. She received a Bachelor of Arts from Michigan State University in 1972 and a Master of Social Work *magna cum laude* from Michigan State University in 1975.[4]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\n### Ingham County politics[edit]\n\n\nWhile a graduate student at Michigan State University in 1974, Stabenow ran for public office for the first time, inspired by the threatened closure of a local nursing home. She won her first election in November 1974, becoming just the third woman elected to the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, on which she served from 1975 to 1978. Stabenow was the first woman and youngest person to date to chair the board of commissioners in 1977 and 1978. She was preceded as chair by one of her political mentors, Ken Hope. She was also instrumental in establishing a women's commission in Ingham County.[5]\n\n\n\n### State legislature[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, Stabenow challenged Michigan State Representative Tom Holcomb in a primary election. She won the primary and eventually the general election for the 58th House District. Stabenow served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1990. She became a force in state Democratic politics and the first woman in House leadership to preside over the House. In 1990, Stabenow ran for the Michigan Senate seat being vacated by William A. Sederburg. She won the election, taking office in 1991 and serving one term through 1994.[5]\n\n\n\n### 1994 gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1994 Michigan gubernatorial election\n\nIn 1994, Stabenow ran in Michigan's Democratic gubernatorial primary to challenge incumbent Republican John Engler in the general election. U.S. Congressman Howard Wolpe won the primary with a plurality of 35% of the vote to Stabenow's 30%. After the primary, Wolpe chose Stabenow as his running mate, and she appeared on the general election ballot as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.[6] Engler defeated the Wolpe–Stabenow ticket, 61%–38%.[7]\n\n\n\n### U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Stabenow ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Dick Chrysler for the opportunity to represent Michigan's 8th congressional district. She defeated Chrysler 54%–44%.[8] In 1998, she was reelected with 57% of the vote.[9] In the House, Stabenow served on the Agriculture and Science Committees.[10]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stabenow speaking during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2000[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow did not seek reelection to the House in 2000, choosing instead to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. She won the Democratic primary unopposed. In the general election, Stabenow defeated Abraham 49.5%–48% (a difference of 67,259 votes).[11]\n\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow was challenged by Republican Michael Bouchard, Oakland County sheriff and former State Senate Majority Floor Leader. Stabenow defeated him 57%–41%.[12]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Pete Hoekstra, former U.S. representative,[13] 59% to 38%.\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican nominee John E. James, 52.3%–45.8%.[14] The margin was 275,660 votes (6.50%),[15] making this the closest U.S. Senate election in Michigan since 2000.[16]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stabenow during the 112th Congress\nBefore her current committee assignments, Stabenow also served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStabenow is only the second person from Michigan to have served in both houses of the Michigan State Legislature and both houses of the United States Congress, the other being Thomas W. Ferry.[17] She is also the first person to have served as a Michigan state legislator to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate[18] (until enactment of the 17th Amendment in 1913, U.S. Senators were selected by state legislatures).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStabenow became the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate on November 16, 2004, when she was elected secretary of the Democratic caucus.[19] As caucus secretary, she assisted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in setting the Democratic agenda and priorities.[17] Senator Dick Durbin was elected minority whip, the second-ranking Democratic spot. In November 2006, Reid announced that Stabenow would leave the caucus secretary position to succeed Hillary Clinton as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, charged with \"engag[ing] Democratic Senators and community leaders across the country in an active dialogue\".[20]\n\n\nAfter Tom Daschle, President Barack Obama's nominee for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, withdrew from consideration, the National Organization for Women urged the president to appoint Stabenow, citing her focus on health care and her background as a social worker.[21]\n\n\nStabenow became chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2011, following the defeat of Blanche Lincoln.[22] A controversial item during Stabenow's tenure was the renewal and reform of the 2012 U.S. Farm Bill. Reid reintroduced 2012's Senate Farm Bill in the 113th Congress in January 2013, saying that it was on his top priority list, and Stabenow voiced support for Reid's move, saying, \"Majority Leader Reid has demonstrated that the Senate will once again make supporting our nation's agriculture economy while cutting spending a top priority.\"[23]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, Stabenow introduced the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (S. 1603; 113th Congress), a bill that would reaffirm the status of lands taken into trust by the Department of the Interior for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band.[24][25] The bill would clarify that the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band's land trust could not be challenged in court under the Supreme Court decision *Carcieri v. Salazar*.[26]\n\n\nStabenow was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol.[27] Along with other senators and staff, she was evacuated from the Senate chamber through a stairwell and taken to a safe location.[28] She called the experience \"heartbreaking\" and \"one of those things out of a movie\" and said she had not felt that much fear since her time at the Capitol during the September 11 attacks.[28] After the Capitol was secure, Congress returned to session to certify the election. Stabenow supported the certification.[29] The day after the attack, Stabenow called for Trump's immediate removal from office through the invocation of the 25th Amendment or impeachment.[30]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (chair)\n\t+ As chairperson, Senator Stabenow is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees.\n* Committee on the Budget\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Parks\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water and Power\n* Committee on Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Afterschool Caucuses[31]\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[32]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nThe American Conservative Union gave Stabenow a 6% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[33]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supports keeping abortion legal. She has voted to expand embryonic stem cell research, and against prohibiting minors crossing state lines for abortions, barring HHS grants to institutions that perform abortions, and criminal penalties for harm or death to a fetus in a violent crime.[34]\n\n\n\n### Cannabis legalization[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supported Michigan Proposal 1 in 2018 to legalize cannabis for recreational use, though she would like to ensure law enforcement is involved so that the law is implemented correctly.[35]\n\n\n\n### Food assistance[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Greg Kaufmann of *The Nation* wrote an article stating that Stabenow was prepared to cut $8 to $9 billion from the food stamp (SNAP) program. In a lengthy statement, Stabenow's office rejected these accusations, maintaining that she \"strongly opposes any changes to food assistance that make cuts in benefits for people who need help putting food on the table\" and that she \"has been the number one defender against the House Republican proposal to cut food assistance by $40 billion.\" Kaufmann doubled down on his charges and challenged Stabenow's office's claims in detail.[36]\n\n\nIn 2017, Stabenow fought to prevent the creation of additional work-requirement rules on SNAP recipients who were older or had smaller children and led a bipartisan effort to get the legislation passed.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2002, Stabenow was one of 23 senators who voted against authorization of the use of military force in Iraq.[39]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Stabenow was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[40]\n\n\n\n### Flint water[edit]\n\n\nStabenow secured $100 million to repair and replace the water lines in Flint, Michigan, which were contaminating the drinking water with lead.[41] She also pushed to include a program that would provide fresh fruits and vegetables to Flint children as part of the Farm Bill.[42]\n\n\n\n### Economic issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senator Stabenow kicks off her Jobs of the Future Tour at Ford's biobased manufacturing lab in Dearborn.\nStabenow has received low scores from free-market groups (Competitive Enterprise Institute, 2013, 0%; American Conservative Union, 2016, 0%; Americans for Prosperity, 2015–16, 0%) and high scores from fiscally liberal groups (Progressive Punch, 2015, 92%; NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, 2012, 91%).[43]\n\n\nIn 2007, Senator Stabenow joined the bipartisan (70-23) support of NOPEC in order to combat conspiratorial policies by foreign oil producers, extending Sherman Anti-Trust Act protection to include foreign cartels such as OPEC, and bring down US oil and gas costs for US consumers.[44][45][46][47][48] In 2008, she voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program proposed by President George W. Bush.[49]\n\n\nIn 2009, Stabenow voted for President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan.[49]\n\n\nIn 2010, she introduced the China Fair Trade Act, saying it would \"prevent federal taxpayer dollars from being used to purchase Chinese products and services until they sign on to and abide by the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement.\" The bill would also require a report on Chinese industrial policies and require the Department of Energy to monitor the development of China's renewable energy sector.[50][51][52][53]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Stabenow called for tax breaks for firms developing bio-based products, using crops like soybeans and corn to create prescriptions drugs, plastics, and soaps.[54]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Stabenow expressed support for \"strategic partnerships between farmers and industry\" and for a recent Obama directive to boost federal purchases of bio-based products.[55]\n\n\nIn 2015, she introduced the Stabenow-Portman Amendment (SA 1299) to address currency manipulation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2015, the International Economic Development Council gave Stabenow the Congressional Leadership Award \"for her significant contributions in the area of economic development.\" The IEDC cited her work on the 2014 Farm Bill, her sponsorship in 2013 of the New Skills for New Jobs Act, and her role in the federal bridge loan program.\"[58][59]\n\n\nIn 2017, Stabenow introduced her American Jobs Agenda, which included two acts: the Make It In America Act and the Bring Jobs Home Act. The former, \"would close loopholes in a 1933 law designed to give American companies priority when the federal government purchases goods.\" She said the act would require that the U.S. government: \"buy American...If the federal agency says they need a waiver, they need to measure how many American jobs will be impacted by purchasing that product made overseas.\"[60][61] The latter, \"would create a tax cut for companies bringing jobs and business activities back to America from another country.\"[62][63]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Stabenow was one of eight Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump noting government-subsidized Chinese steel had been placed into the American market in recent years below cost and had hurt the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that fed it, calling on him to raise the steel issue with President of China Xi Jinping in his meeting with him.[64]\n\n\nIn May 2017, she and Senator Gary Peters announced a $210,000 EDA grant to the West Michigan Shoreline Regional Development Commission \"to help spur economic development in West Michigan.\"[65] The same month, she said that owing to a major change in farmers' margins since the 2014 Farm Bill, the farm safety net needed to be strengthened, especially for dairy farmers.[66]\n\n\nAt a July 13, 2017, economics roundtable, she said that the \"#1 request she gets in Michigan\" is for \"Professional technical jobs, building construction jobs—folks that can actually make things and do things.\" She said that Democrats can succeed in elections by \"going to our core. We are the party that are willing to take risks to make things better...We believe in our core in an economy that actually works for everybody. That is how you grow America.\"[67]\n\n\nThe Biotechnology Industry Organization thanked Stabenow in 2017 for supporting development of a \"biobased economy,\" specifically for her introduction of the Renewable Chemicals Act of 2017, which would \"allow taxpayers to claim a production tax credit of 15 cents per pound of biobased content of each renewable chemical produced during the taxable year.\"[68][69][70]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2017, Stabenow and Peters introduced the Small Business Access to Capital Act, designed to \"reauthorize and improve the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to help small businesses grow and create jobs.\" It built \"on the successful SSBCI initiative that both lawmakers championed in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010\" and that \"funds the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and other state-led lending programs that leverage private financing to help small businesses access the capital they need.\"[71][72][73][74]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nStabenow has received high marks from groups supporting immigration (American Immigration Lawyers Association, 2013–14, 100%; National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, 2013–14, 100%) and low marks from groups opposed to immigration: Federation for American Immigration Reform, 2014, 0%; Numbers USA, 2017, 0%.[75]\n\n\nDuring the two-day January 2018 government shutdown, Stabenow was among 81 senators who effectively ended the shutdown by approving a three-week stopgap spending bill that \"included reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years\". This agreement was obtained after the Republican leadership \"pledged to soon take up immigration legislation\". She said they had \"reached a bipartisan agreement that funds children's health insurance and moves us closer to a solution that provides long-term certainty for Michigan families and our national defense\".[76][77]\n\n\nIn January 2017, she opposed Trump's executive order temporarily limiting immigration from several Muslim majority countries, saying it: \"is ruining America's reputation in the world, undermining our relationships with our most critical allies, and most heartbreakingly, destroying the lives of good and law-abiding people.\"[78][79][80]\n\n\nStabenow voted against providing COVID-19 pandemic financial support to undocumented immigrants on February 4, 2021.[81]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supported Obama's Iran deal that sought to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons for 10 years and attempted to halt their uranium production.[82]\n\n\n\n### Income inequality[edit]\n\n\nRecounting a 2014 Senate hearing on income inequality, George Packer singled out Stabenow as the only committee member who pushed back on the idea that it was caused largely by the withdrawal from the workforce of middle-aged people who preferred to collect welfare. Stabenow \"pointed out that almost all the voters she heard from in high-unemployment Michigan still wanted to work.\"[83]\n\n\n\n### Government spending[edit]\n\n\nShe has received low scores from low-spending advocates (Club for Growth, 2016, 8%; Council for Citizens against Government Waste, 2015, 0%; National Taxpayers Union, 2015, 9%).[84]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stabenow meeting with students from the Ross School of Business in 2016\nIn 2011, Stabenow introduced the Reengaging Americans in Serious Education Act (RAISE UP Act), whereby the Labor Department would fund programs to help \"disconnected youth\" get diplomas, degrees, and job certifications. In 2012, she co-sponsored a bill to freeze student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent and make additional funds available for Pell Grants.[85]\n\n\nIn 2016, Stabenow and others introduced the Reducing Educational Debt Act, which she promoted with the #InTheRed hashtag.[86][87]\n\n\nShe expressed \"strong concerns\" about Trump's nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, saying: \"DeVos and her family have a long record of pushing policies that I believe have seriously undermined public education in Michigan and failed our children.\"[88]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supports gun control and supports a national assault weapons ban.[89]\nAfter the Orlando nightclub shooting, Stabenow participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster.[90] One month later, she supported bills to ban people on the terrorist watchlist from buying guns and to expand background checks. Neither bill passed the Senate. Stabenow blamed the National Rifle Association (NRA) for the bills' failure to pass.[91]\n\n\nIn 2017, following the Las Vegas shooting, Stabenow and Debbie Dingell introduced a law that would make it illegal for people convicted of misdemeanor stalking to buy guns.[92]\n\n\nStabenow has an \"A+\" rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and an \"F\" rating from both the NRA and the Gun Owners of America.[93]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nStabenow has helped open 10 community health centers in Detroit while in office.[41]\n\n\nShe has received high scores from Planned Parenthood (2017, 100%) and low scores from National Right to Life Committee, (2013, 0%).[94]\n\n\nIn the 2000 campaign, she: \"promised to make the pharmaceutical industry lower prescription drug prices, to maintain Social Security benefits and to give Medicare a new prescription drug plan.\" She pledged to \"fight the pharmaceutical and insurance industries—the two industries that spend the most money lobbying federal officials\" and accused the pharmaceutical industry of \"making up to 20 percent net profit each year...on the backs of families, seniors and businesses.\" Her spokesperson said: \"In the last election, I think the pharmaceutical industry spent more campaigning against her than any other candidate...She was enemy number one.\"[95][96][97][98] Stabenow voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009,[99] and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[100] She also sponsored S. 2257, the Excellence in Mental Health Act.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2016, she said that approving money to combat Zika was a top congressional priority.[101]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Stabenow was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences in the event that the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act (ACA) lawsuit prevailed in courts, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".[102]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Stabenow was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[103]\n\n\n\n### Defense[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Stabenow voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.[104] The bill included highly controversial provisions, drafted by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain in closed session, that would allow for the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens deemed potential terrorists and enemies of the state.[105]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2009, Stabenow was reported by *The Detroit News* as saying, \"Global warming creates volatility. I feel it when I'm flying. The storms are more volatile. We are paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes.\"[106] She has, however, opposed regulation of greenhouse gases, enhanced fuel efficiency standards in California, and greenhouse gas emission reporting standards.[107]\n\n\nStabenow voted for the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493). In March 2011, *ThinkProgress* accused her of joining \"the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate,\" saying that the legislation was: \"being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.\"[107]\n\n\nStabenow's proposed amendment to keep the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions for two years also drew criticism.[108] The amendment would have given “coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial sources a two year exemption” from rules requiring them to report greenhouse gas emissions.[109] She defended her position by calling her amendment: \"a common-sense approach that allows protections from carbon pollution, determined by scientists and public health experts, to continue being developed while providing businesses the support and incentives they need as they reduce pollution, generate new clean energy technologies and create jobs.\"[110]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Stabenow was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the agency: \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"[111]\n\n\n\n#### Drilling in the Great Lakes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Stabenow called for a total ban on drilling in the Great Lakes. Critics noted that \"a U.S. federal ban on all oil and natural gas offshore drilling in the Great Lakes\" had already \"been in place since 2005\" and that Canada banned offshore oil drilling but had \"roughly 500 offshore gas wells in Lake Erie\" plus 23 \"slant wells\" that \"drill for oil on shore but extend under Lake Erie.\"[112] In 2015, Stabenow and Gary Peters introduced the Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act \"to ban shipping of crude oil by vessel on the Great Lakes and require a comprehensive, top-to-bottom review of hazardous pipelines in the region.\"[113][114]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Stabenow expressed support for the bipartisan effort to retain funding for The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.[115]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Stabenow and Peters led an effort to link an aid package for the Flint water crisis to flood relief funds for Louisiana.[116]\n\n\n\n#### Canadian waste disposal[edit]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2006, Stabenow, Senator Carl Levin and Representative John Dingell announced an agreement that would completely cease Ontario's dumping of solid waste in Michigan within four years. This had been an issue in Michigan for the past several years. Stabenow had previously introduced legislation in the Senate intended to reduce the dumping of Canadian trash in Michigan.[117] In July 2006, the Senate unanimously passed a law sponsored by Stabenow requiring the payment of a $420 inspection fee for every truckload of Canadian trash brought into Michigan.[118]\n\n\n\n### Fairness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nAsked in 2009 by Bill Press whether she would support a return of the Fairness Doctrine, under which the federal government enforced an ideological \"balance\" on the airwaves, Stabenow said yes: \"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves.\" Asked whether she would push for Senate hearings on the subject, she said, \"I have already had some discussions with colleagues and, you know, I feel like that's gonna happen. Yep.\" It has been noted that Stabenow's then husband was Tom Athans, an executive in left-wing radio (Air America, Democracy Radio), whose career would have benefited from such legislation.[119]\n\n\nStabenow is probably the most prominent politician to seriously support a new Fairness Doctrine.[120][121]\n\n\n\n### GMOs[edit]\n\n\nStabenow, as Senate Agriculture Committee Chair, added an amendment to the 2013–14 Farm Bill that prohibited state laws requiring GMO labeling for foods. She has been criticized because this amendment aided Monsanto and other agribusinesses, which donated over three-quarters of a million dollars to her campaign during that election cycle.[122][123] In 2016, she was again criticized for her role in the passage of a law that overruled state laws mandating GMO labeling.[124]\n\n\n\n### Trump nominations[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Stabenow opposed Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions as AG: \"Because of his record on civil rights and his votes against anti-domestic violence legislation, I cannot support him to be our nation's highest law enforcement officer...Families in Michigan and across the country deserve an attorney general who will enforce the nation's laws fairly and equally.\"[125]\n\n\nThat March, she opposed Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: \"After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's rulings, it is clear that he has a long record of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard-working Americans. And, therefore, in my judgment, he does not meet this standard of balance and impartiality.\"[126]\n\n\nIn July 2018, citing his past rulings on presidential powers, she opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, furthermore stating that the FBI should perform a background check regarding multiple allegations of sexual assault.[127][128]\n\n\nShe similarly opposed Trump's 2020 nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, stating: \"It's very clear from her writings, multiple writings, that she will be the vote that takes away health care for millions of Americans, including 130 million people and counting with pre-existing conditions...\"[129] She voted against the nomination while wearing a face mask depicting Barrett's predecessor Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[130]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2023, Stabenow announced her intention to retire from the Senate. Her announcement cited a desire to \"pass the torch\" to Michigan's next generation of leadership: \"I have always believed it's not enough to be the first unless there is a second and a third\". She also noted time with family as a motivation for her retirement. If she serves in the Senate until her term ends in January 2024, she will have held elective office for 50 years.[131] In February 2023, Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin launched a campaign to succeed Stabenow in the Senate.[132]\n\n\nIn February 2023, a portrait of Stabenow by Michigan artist Joshua Adam Risner was unveiled in the Russell Senate Office Building. Congressional committee chairs traditionally receive portraits in their committee rooms. Stabenow's portrait came due to her years as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.[133] It was commissioned by the Historical Society of Michigan.[134]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nStabenow is a member of the United Methodist Church.[135]\n\n\nStabenow was first married to Dennis Stabenow.[136] The couple had two children and divorced in 1990.[136]\n\n\nIn 2003, Stabenow married Tom Athans, co-founder of Democracy Radio and former executive vice president of Air America.

A member of the Democratic Party, she became the state's first female U.S. senator after winning the 2000 election. \n\n\nBefore her election to the Senate, Stabenow was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 8th congressional district from 1997 to 2001. Previously, she served on the Ingham County Board of Commissioners and in the Michigan State Legislature.\n\n\nStabenow was reelected to Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018. She became the state's senior U.S. senator upon Carl Levin's retirement in 2015. Stabenow chaired the Senate Agriculture Committee from 2011 to 2015 and again since 2021. She became chair of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee in 2017. At the start of the 118th Congress, Stabenow became the dean of the Michigan congressional delegation, upon the retirement of Representative Fred Upton. In January 2023, she announced that she would not seek reelection in 2024.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early career[edit]\n\n\nStabenow was born in Gladwin, Michigan, the daughter of Anna Merle (née Hallmark) and Robert Lee Greer.[3] She grew up in Clare, Michigan. She graduated from Clare High School, where she was president of her junior class, the first female class president at the school. She received a Bachelor of Arts from Michigan State University in 1972 and a Master of Social Work *magna cum laude* from Michigan State University in 1975.[4]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\n### Ingham County politics[edit]\n\n\nWhile a graduate student at Michigan State University in 1974, Stabenow ran for public office for the first time, inspired by the threatened closure of a local nursing home. She won her first election in November 1974, becoming just the third woman elected to the Ingham County Board of Commissioners, on which she served from 1975 to 1978. Stabenow was the first woman and youngest person to date to chair the board of commissioners in 1977 and 1978. She was preceded as chair by one of her political mentors, Ken Hope. She was also instrumental in establishing a women's commission in Ingham County.[5]\n\n\n\n### State legislature[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, Stabenow challenged Michigan State Representative Tom Holcomb in a primary election. She won the primary and eventually the general election for the 58th House District. Stabenow served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 1979 to 1990. She became a force in state Democratic politics and the first woman in House leadership to preside over the House. In 1990, Stabenow ran for the Michigan Senate seat being vacated by William A. Sederburg. She won the election, taking office in 1991 and serving one term through 1994.[5]\n\n\n\n### 1994 gubernatorial election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1994 Michigan gubernatorial election\n\nIn 1994, Stabenow ran in Michigan's Democratic gubernatorial primary to challenge incumbent Republican John Engler in the general election. U.S. Congressman Howard Wolpe won the primary with a plurality of 35% of the vote to Stabenow's 30%. After the primary, Wolpe chose Stabenow as his running mate, and she appeared on the general election ballot as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.[6] Engler defeated the Wolpe–Stabenow ticket, 61%–38%.[7]\n\n\n\n### U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Stabenow ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, challenging incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Dick Chrysler for the opportunity to represent Michigan's 8th congressional district. She defeated Chrysler 54%–44%.[8] In 1998, she was reelected with 57% of the vote.[9] In the House, Stabenow served on the Agriculture and Science Committees.[10]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stabenow speaking during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2000[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow did not seek reelection to the House in 2000, choosing instead to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Spencer Abraham. She won the Democratic primary unopposed. In the general election, Stabenow defeated Abraham 49.5%–48% (a difference of 67,259 votes).[11]\n\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow was challenged by Republican Michael Bouchard, Oakland County sheriff and former State Senate Majority Floor Leader. Stabenow defeated him 57%–41%.[12]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow was unopposed in the Democratic primary and defeated Republican nominee Pete Hoekstra, former U.S. representative,[13] 59% to 38%.\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Michigan\n\nStabenow was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican nominee John E. James, 52.3%–45.8%.[14] The margin was 275,660 votes (6.50%),[15] making this the closest U.S. Senate election in Michigan since 2000.[16]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stabenow during the 112th Congress\nBefore her current committee assignments, Stabenow also served on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee and the Special Committee on Aging.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStabenow is only the second person from Michigan to have served in both houses of the Michigan State Legislature and both houses of the United States Congress, the other being Thomas W. Ferry.[17] She is also the first person to have served as a Michigan state legislator to be popularly elected to the U.S. Senate[18] (until enactment of the 17th Amendment in 1913, U.S. Senators were selected by state legislatures).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStabenow became the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate on November 16, 2004, when she was elected secretary of the Democratic caucus.[19] As caucus secretary, she assisted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in setting the Democratic agenda and priorities.[17] Senator Dick Durbin was elected minority whip, the second-ranking Democratic spot. In November 2006, Reid announced that Stabenow would leave the caucus secretary position to succeed Hillary Clinton as chair of the Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, charged with \"engag[ing] Democratic Senators and community leaders across the country in an active dialogue\".[20]\n\n\nAfter Tom Daschle, President Barack Obama's nominee for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, withdrew from consideration, the National Organization for Women urged the president to appoint Stabenow, citing her focus on health care and her background as a social worker.[21]\n\n\nStabenow became chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2011, following the defeat of Blanche Lincoln.[22] A controversial item during Stabenow's tenure was the renewal and reform of the 2012 U.S. Farm Bill. Reid reintroduced 2012's Senate Farm Bill in the 113th Congress in January 2013, saying that it was on his top priority list, and Stabenow voiced support for Reid's move, saying, \"Majority Leader Reid has demonstrated that the Senate will once again make supporting our nation's agriculture economy while cutting spending a top priority.\"[23]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, Stabenow introduced the Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act (S. 1603; 113th Congress), a bill that would reaffirm the status of lands taken into trust by the Department of the Interior for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band.[24][25] The bill would clarify that the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band's land trust could not be challenged in court under the Supreme Court decision *Carcieri v. Salazar*.[26]\n\n\nStabenow was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol.[27] Along with other senators and staff, she was evacuated from the Senate chamber through a stairwell and taken to a safe location.[28] She called the experience \"heartbreaking\" and \"one of those things out of a movie\" and said she had not felt that much fear since her time at the Capitol during the September 11 attacks.[28] After the Capitol was secure, Congress returned to session to certify the election. Stabenow supported the certification.[29] The day after the attack, Stabenow called for Trump's immediate removal from office through the invocation of the 25th Amendment or impeachment.[30]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (chair)\n\t+ As chairperson, Senator Stabenow is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees.\n* Committee on the Budget\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Parks\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water and Power\n* Committee on Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Afterschool Caucuses[31]\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[32]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nThe American Conservative Union gave Stabenow a 6% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[33]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supports keeping abortion legal. She has voted to expand embryonic stem cell research, and against prohibiting minors crossing state lines for abortions, barring HHS grants to institutions that perform abortions, and criminal penalties for harm or death to a fetus in a violent crime.[34]\n\n\n\n### Cannabis legalization[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supported Michigan Proposal 1 in 2018 to legalize cannabis for recreational use, though she would like to ensure law enforcement is involved so that the law is implemented correctly.[35]\n\n\n\n### Food assistance[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Greg Kaufmann of *The Nation* wrote an article stating that Stabenow was prepared to cut $8 to $9 billion from the food stamp (SNAP) program. In a lengthy statement, Stabenow's office rejected these accusations, maintaining that she \"strongly opposes any changes to food assistance that make cuts in benefits for people who need help putting food on the table\" and that she \"has been the number one defender against the House Republican proposal to cut food assistance by $40 billion.\" Kaufmann doubled down on his charges and challenged Stabenow's office's claims in detail.[36]\n\n\nIn 2017, Stabenow fought to prevent the creation of additional work-requirement rules on SNAP recipients who were older or had smaller children and led a bipartisan effort to get the legislation passed.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2002, Stabenow was one of 23 senators who voted against authorization of the use of military force in Iraq.[39]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Stabenow was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[40]\n\n\n\n### Flint water[edit]\n\n\nStabenow secured $100 million to repair and replace the water lines in Flint, Michigan, which were contaminating the drinking water with lead.[41] She also pushed to include a program that would provide fresh fruits and vegetables to Flint children as part of the Farm Bill.[42]\n\n\n\n### Economic issues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senator Stabenow kicks off her Jobs of the Future Tour at Ford's biobased manufacturing lab in Dearborn.\nStabenow has received low scores from free-market groups (Competitive Enterprise Institute, 2013, 0%; American Conservative Union, 2016, 0%; Americans for Prosperity, 2015–16, 0%) and high scores from fiscally liberal groups (Progressive Punch, 2015, 92%; NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, 2012, 91%).[43]\n\n\nIn 2007, Senator Stabenow joined the bipartisan (70-23) support of NOPEC in order to combat conspiratorial policies by foreign oil producers, extending Sherman Anti-Trust Act protection to include foreign cartels such as OPEC, and bring down US oil and gas costs for US consumers.[44][45][46][47][48] In 2008, she voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program proposed by President George W. Bush.[49]\n\n\nIn 2009, Stabenow voted for President Barack Obama's $787 billion stimulus plan.[49]\n\n\nIn 2010, she introduced the China Fair Trade Act, saying it would \"prevent federal taxpayer dollars from being used to purchase Chinese products and services until they sign on to and abide by the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement.\" The bill would also require a report on Chinese industrial policies and require the Department of Energy to monitor the development of China's renewable energy sector.[50][51][52][53]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Stabenow called for tax breaks for firms developing bio-based products, using crops like soybeans and corn to create prescriptions drugs, plastics, and soaps.[54]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Stabenow expressed support for \"strategic partnerships between farmers and industry\" and for a recent Obama directive to boost federal purchases of bio-based products.[55]\n\n\nIn 2015, she introduced the Stabenow-Portman Amendment (SA 1299) to address currency manipulation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2015, the International Economic Development Council gave Stabenow the Congressional Leadership Award \"for her significant contributions in the area of economic development.\" The IEDC cited her work on the 2014 Farm Bill, her sponsorship in 2013 of the New Skills for New Jobs Act, and her role in the federal bridge loan program.\"[58][59]\n\n\nIn 2017, Stabenow introduced her American Jobs Agenda, which included two acts: the Make It In America Act and the Bring Jobs Home Act. The former, \"would close loopholes in a 1933 law designed to give American companies priority when the federal government purchases goods.\" She said the act would require that the U.S. government: \"buy American...If the federal agency says they need a waiver, they need to measure how many American jobs will be impacted by purchasing that product made overseas.\"[60][61] The latter, \"would create a tax cut for companies bringing jobs and business activities back to America from another country.\"[62][63]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Stabenow was one of eight Democratic senators to sign a letter to Trump noting government-subsidized Chinese steel had been placed into the American market in recent years below cost and had hurt the domestic steel industry and the iron ore industry that fed it, calling on him to raise the steel issue with President of China Xi Jinping in his meeting with him.[64]\n\n\nIn May 2017, she and Senator Gary Peters announced a $210,000 EDA grant to the West Michigan Shoreline Regional Development Commission \"to help spur economic development in West Michigan.\"[65] The same month, she said that owing to a major change in farmers' margins since the 2014 Farm Bill, the farm safety net needed to be strengthened, especially for dairy farmers.[66]\n\n\nAt a July 13, 2017, economics roundtable, she said that the \"#1 request she gets in Michigan\" is for \"Professional technical jobs, building construction jobs—folks that can actually make things and do things.\" She said that Democrats can succeed in elections by \"going to our core. We are the party that are willing to take risks to make things better...We believe in our core in an economy that actually works for everybody. That is how you grow America.\"[67]\n\n\nThe Biotechnology Industry Organization thanked Stabenow in 2017 for supporting development of a \"biobased economy,\" specifically for her introduction of the Renewable Chemicals Act of 2017, which would \"allow taxpayers to claim a production tax credit of 15 cents per pound of biobased content of each renewable chemical produced during the taxable year.\"[68][69][70]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2017, Stabenow and Peters introduced the Small Business Access to Capital Act, designed to \"reauthorize and improve the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) to help small businesses grow and create jobs.\" It built \"on the successful SSBCI initiative that both lawmakers championed in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010\" and that \"funds the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and other state-led lending programs that leverage private financing to help small businesses access the capital they need.\"[71][72][73][74]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nStabenow has received high marks from groups supporting immigration (American Immigration Lawyers Association, 2013–14, 100%; National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, 2013–14, 100%) and low marks from groups opposed to immigration: Federation for American Immigration Reform, 2014, 0%; Numbers USA, 2017, 0%.[75]\n\n\nDuring the two-day January 2018 government shutdown, Stabenow was among 81 senators who effectively ended the shutdown by approving a three-week stopgap spending bill that \"included reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program for six years\". This agreement was obtained after the Republican leadership \"pledged to soon take up immigration legislation\". She said they had \"reached a bipartisan agreement that funds children's health insurance and moves us closer to a solution that provides long-term certainty for Michigan families and our national defense\".[76][77]\n\n\nIn January 2017, she opposed Trump's executive order temporarily limiting immigration from several Muslim majority countries, saying it: \"is ruining America's reputation in the world, undermining our relationships with our most critical allies, and most heartbreakingly, destroying the lives of good and law-abiding people.\"[78][79][80]\n\n\nStabenow voted against providing COVID-19 pandemic financial support to undocumented immigrants on February 4, 2021.[81]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supported Obama's Iran deal that sought to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons for 10 years and attempted to halt their uranium production.[82]\n\n\n\n### Income inequality[edit]\n\n\nRecounting a 2014 Senate hearing on income inequality, George Packer singled out Stabenow as the only committee member who pushed back on the idea that it was caused largely by the withdrawal from the workforce of middle-aged people who preferred to collect welfare. Stabenow \"pointed out that almost all the voters she heard from in high-unemployment Michigan still wanted to work.\"[83]\n\n\n\n### Government spending[edit]\n\n\nShe has received low scores from low-spending advocates (Club for Growth, 2016, 8%; Council for Citizens against Government Waste, 2015, 0%; National Taxpayers Union, 2015, 9%).[84]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stabenow meeting with students from the Ross School of Business in 2016\nIn 2011, Stabenow introduced the Reengaging Americans in Serious Education Act (RAISE UP Act), whereby the Labor Department would fund programs to help \"disconnected youth\" get diplomas, degrees, and job certifications. In 2012, she co-sponsored a bill to freeze student loan interest rates at 3.4 percent and make additional funds available for Pell Grants.[85]\n\n\nIn 2016, Stabenow and others introduced the Reducing Educational Debt Act, which she promoted with the #InTheRed hashtag.[86][87]\n\n\nShe expressed \"strong concerns\" about Trump's nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education Secretary, saying: \"DeVos and her family have a long record of pushing policies that I believe have seriously undermined public education in Michigan and failed our children.\"[88]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nStabenow supports gun control and supports a national assault weapons ban.[89]\nAfter the Orlando nightclub shooting, Stabenow participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster.[90] One month later, she supported bills to ban people on the terrorist watchlist from buying guns and to expand background checks. Neither bill passed the Senate. Stabenow blamed the National Rifle Association (NRA) for the bills' failure to pass.[91]\n\n\nIn 2017, following the Las Vegas shooting, Stabenow and Debbie Dingell introduced a law that would make it illegal for people convicted of misdemeanor stalking to buy guns.[92]\n\n\nStabenow has an \"A+\" rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and an \"F\" rating from both the NRA and the Gun Owners of America.[93]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nStabenow has helped open 10 community health centers in Detroit while in office.[41]\n\n\nShe has received high scores from Planned Parenthood (2017, 100%) and low scores from National Right to Life Committee, (2013, 0%).[94]\n\n\nIn the 2000 campaign, she: \"promised to make the pharmaceutical industry lower prescription drug prices, to maintain Social Security benefits and to give Medicare a new prescription drug plan.\" She pledged to \"fight the pharmaceutical and insurance industries—the two industries that spend the most money lobbying federal officials\" and accused the pharmaceutical industry of \"making up to 20 percent net profit each year...on the backs of families, seniors and businesses.\" Her spokesperson said: \"In the last election, I think the pharmaceutical industry spent more campaigning against her than any other candidate...She was enemy number one.\"[95][96][97][98] Stabenow voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009,[99] and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.[100] She also sponsored S. 2257, the Excellence in Mental Health Act.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn September 1, 2016, she said that approving money to combat Zika was a top congressional priority.[101]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Stabenow was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences in the event that the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act (ACA) lawsuit prevailed in courts, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".[102]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Stabenow was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[103]\n\n\n\n### Defense[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Stabenow voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.[104] The bill included highly controversial provisions, drafted by Senators Carl Levin and John McCain in closed session, that would allow for the indefinite military detention without trial of American citizens deemed potential terrorists and enemies of the state.[105]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n#### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nOn August 10, 2009, Stabenow was reported by *The Detroit News* as saying, \"Global warming creates volatility. I feel it when I'm flying. The storms are more volatile. We are paying the price in more hurricanes and tornadoes.\"[106] She has, however, opposed regulation of greenhouse gases, enhanced fuel efficiency standards in California, and greenhouse gas emission reporting standards.[107]\n\n\nStabenow voted for the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 (S.493). In March 2011, *ThinkProgress* accused her of joining \"the pro-polluter frenzy sweeping the U.S. Senate,\" saying that the legislation was: \"being used as a vehicle for senators who wish to prevent regulation of greenhouse pollution from oil refineries, coal-fired power plants, heavy industry, and other major emitters. Stabenow has added her amendment to three others intended to hamstring the Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of carbon polluters.\"[107]\n\n\nStabenow's proposed amendment to keep the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions for two years also drew criticism.[108] The amendment would have given “coal-fired power plants, oil refineries and other industrial sources a two year exemption” from rules requiring them to report greenhouse gas emissions.[109] She defended her position by calling her amendment: \"a common-sense approach that allows protections from carbon pollution, determined by scientists and public health experts, to continue being developed while providing businesses the support and incentives they need as they reduce pollution, generate new clean energy technologies and create jobs.\"[110]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Stabenow was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the agency: \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"[111]\n\n\n\n#### Drilling in the Great Lakes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Stabenow called for a total ban on drilling in the Great Lakes. Critics noted that \"a U.S. federal ban on all oil and natural gas offshore drilling in the Great Lakes\" had already \"been in place since 2005\" and that Canada banned offshore oil drilling but had \"roughly 500 offshore gas wells in Lake Erie\" plus 23 \"slant wells\" that \"drill for oil on shore but extend under Lake Erie.\"[112] In 2015, Stabenow and Gary Peters introduced the Pipeline Improvement and Preventing Spills Act \"to ban shipping of crude oil by vessel on the Great Lakes and require a comprehensive, top-to-bottom review of hazardous pipelines in the region.\"[113][114]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Stabenow expressed support for the bipartisan effort to retain funding for The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.[115]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Stabenow and Peters led an effort to link an aid package for the Flint water crisis to flood relief funds for Louisiana.[116]\n\n\n\n#### Canadian waste disposal[edit]\n\n\nOn August 31, 2006, Stabenow, Senator Carl Levin and Representative John Dingell announced an agreement that would completely cease Ontario's dumping of solid waste in Michigan within four years. This had been an issue in Michigan for the past several years. Stabenow had previously introduced legislation in the Senate intended to reduce the dumping of Canadian trash in Michigan.[117] In July 2006, the Senate unanimously passed a law sponsored by Stabenow requiring the payment of a $420 inspection fee for every truckload of Canadian trash brought into Michigan.[118]\n\n\n\n### Fairness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nAsked in 2009 by Bill Press whether she would support a return of the Fairness Doctrine, under which the federal government enforced an ideological \"balance\" on the airwaves, Stabenow said yes: \"I absolutely think it's time to be bringing accountability to the airwaves.\" Asked whether she would push for Senate hearings on the subject, she said, \"I have already had some discussions with colleagues and, you know, I feel like that's gonna happen. Yep.\" It has been noted that Stabenow's then husband was Tom Athans, an executive in left-wing radio (Air America, Democracy Radio), whose career would have benefited from such legislation.[119]\n\n\nStabenow is probably the most prominent politician to seriously support a new Fairness Doctrine.[120][121]\n\n\n\n### GMOs[edit]\n\n\nStabenow, as Senate Agriculture Committee Chair, added an amendment to the 2013–14 Farm Bill that prohibited state laws requiring GMO labeling for foods. She has been criticized because this amendment aided Monsanto and other agribusinesses, which donated over three-quarters of a million dollars to her campaign during that election cycle.[122][123] In 2016, she was again criticized for her role in the passage of a law that overruled state laws mandating GMO labeling.[124]\n\n\n\n### Trump nominations[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Stabenow opposed Trump's nomination of Jeff Sessions as AG: \"Because of his record on civil rights and his votes against anti-domestic violence legislation, I cannot support him to be our nation's highest law enforcement officer...Families in Michigan and across the country deserve an attorney general who will enforce the nation's laws fairly and equally.\"[125]\n\n\nThat March, she opposed Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court: \"After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's rulings, it is clear that he has a long record of siding with special interests and institutions instead of hard-working Americans. And, therefore, in my judgment, he does not meet this standard of balance and impartiality.\"[126]\n\n\nIn July 2018, citing his past rulings on presidential powers, she opposed the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, furthermore stating that the FBI should perform a background check regarding multiple allegations of sexual assault.[127][128]\n\n\nShe similarly opposed Trump's 2020 nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, stating: \"It's very clear from her writings, multiple writings, that she will be the vote that takes away health care for millions of Americans, including 130 million people and counting with pre-existing conditions...\"[129] She voted against the nomination while wearing a face mask depicting Barrett's predecessor Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[130]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2023, Stabenow announced her intention to retire from the Senate. Her announcement cited a desire to \"pass the torch\" to Michigan's next generation of leadership: \"I have always believed it's not enough to be the first unless there is a second and a third\". She also noted time with family as a motivation for her retirement. If she serves in the Senate until her term ends in January 2024, she will have held elective office for 50 years.[131] In February 2023, Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin launched a campaign to succeed Stabenow in the Senate.[132]\n\n\nIn February 2023, a portrait of Stabenow by Michigan artist Joshua Adam Risner was unveiled in the Russell Senate Office Building. Congressional committee chairs traditionally receive portraits in their committee rooms. Stabenow's portrait came due to her years as chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.[133] It was commissioned by the Historical Society of Michigan.[134]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nStabenow is a member of the United Methodist Church.[135]\n\n\nStabenow was first married to Dennis Stabenow.[136] The couple had two children and divorced in 1990.[136]\n\n\nIn 2003, Stabenow married Tom Athans, co-founder of Democracy Radio and former executive vice president of Air America.

A member of the Democratic Party, she also served as the 78th governor of New Hampshire from 1997 to 2003. Shaheen is the first woman elected as both a governor and a U.S. senator.[1]\n\n\nAfter serving two terms in the New Hampshire Senate, Shaheen was elected governor in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000. In 2002, she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate against Republican nominee John E. Sununu. She served as director of the Harvard Institute of Politics before resigning to run for the U.S. Senate again in the 2008 election, defeating Sununu in a rematch. She is the dean of New Hampshire's congressional delegation, serving in Congress since 2009.\n\n\nShaheen became the first Democratic senator from New Hampshire since John A. Durkin, who was defeated in 1980. In 2014, she became the second Democrat from New Hampshire to be reelected to the Senate and the first since Thomas J. McIntyre in 1972. She was reelected to a third term in 2020, defeating Republican nominee Bryant Messner.\n\n\n\n\n## Personal life, education and pre-political career[edit]\n\n\nJeanne Shaheen was born Cynthia Jeanne Bowers in St. Charles, Missouri, the daughter of Belle Ernestine (Stillings) and Ivan E. Bowers.[2][*unreliable source?*] She is a 12th-generation descendant of the prominent Native American Pocahontas.[3][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nShaheen graduated from high school in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, and earned a bachelor's degree in English from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania and a master's degree in political science from the University of Mississippi.[4] She taught high school in Mississippi[5] and moved to New Hampshire in 1973, where she taught school and, with her husband, owned a store that sold used jewelry.[6] She is married to Bill Shaheen, an attorney and judge. They have three children.\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nA Democrat, she worked on several campaigns, including Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, and as the New Hampshire campaign manager for Gary Hart in 1984,[7] before running for office in 1990, when she was elected to the state Senate for the 21st district. She was elected governor of New Hampshire in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000.[8]\n\n\nIn April 2005, Shaheen was named director of Harvard's Institute of Politics,[9] succeeding former U.S. Representative and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman.\n\n\n\n## Governor of New Hampshire[edit]\n\n\nShaheen's decision to run for New Hampshire governor followed the retirement of Republican Governor Steve Merrill. Her opponent in 1996 was Ovide M. Lamontagne, then chairman of the State Board of Education. Shaheen presented herself as a moderate. According to a PBS profile, she focused on education funding issues, and pledged to expand kindergarten. She defeated Lamontagne by 57 to 40 percent.[10]\n\n\nShaheen was the first woman to be elected governor of New Hampshire.[11] (She was not, however, the first woman to serve as New Hampshire's governor; Vesta M. Roy was acting governor from December 30, 1982, until January 6, 1983.)[12]\n\n\nIn 1998, she was reelected by a margin of 66 to 31 percent.[13][14]\n\n\nIn both 1996 and 1998, Shaheen took a no-new-taxes pledge. After a court decision preventing education from being largely supported by local taxes, \"her administration devised a plan that would have increased education spending and set a statewide property tax.\"[15]\n\n\nRunning for a third term in 2000, Shaheen refused to renew her no-new-taxes pledge, becoming the first New Hampshire governor in 38 years to win an election without making that pledge.[16] Shaheen's preferred solution to the school-funding problem was not a broad-based tax but legalized video-gambling at state racetracks—a solution repeatedly rejected by the state legislature.[17][18]\n\n\nIn 2001 Shaheen tried to implement a 2.5% sales tax, the first broad-based tariff of its kind in New Hampshire, which has never had a sales tax. The state legislature rejected her proposal.[19] She also proposed an increase in the state's cigarette tax and a 4.5% capital gains tax.\n\n\n\n## Presidential politics[edit]\n\n\n### 2000[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, Shaheen supported Al Gore, and her husband served as Gore's New Hampshire campaign manager. According to the *New York Observer*, the Shaheens were critical in helping Gore win a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary over Bill Bradley.[20][21]\n\n\nGore added Shaheen to his short list of potential vice presidential nominees, which also included Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, North Carolina Senator John Edwards, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, and Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.[22] Shaheen responded to speculation by stating she wasn't interested in the job.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2004[edit]\n\n\nAfter a short time teaching at Harvard University (and a fellowship in the Institute of Politics with former Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift), Shaheen was named national chairperson of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in September 2003.\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen on the campaign trail at Dartmouth College, July 2008\n2002\nMain article: 2002 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nAfter three two-year terms as governor, Shaheen declined to run for a fourth, instead choosing to run for the U.S. Senate in 2002. Republican John E. Sununu defeated her by a 51 percent to 47 percent margin (19,751 votes). In an interview with the *Concord Monitor*, Shaheen attributed her loss in part to \"discussion about the job that [she] did as governor.\" At that time, early Republican advertisements slammed her support for putting a sales tax on the ballot or faulted her for failing schools.[24]\n\n\nIn June 2004, former Republican consultant Allen Raymond pleaded guilty to jamming Democratic Party lines set up to get New Hampshire Democrats to the polls in 2002, which some (most notably former Senator Bob Smith, whom Sununu defeated in the Republican primary) believe contributed to Shaheen's loss.[25] A judge sentenced Raymond to five months in jail in February 2005. Charles McGee, the former state GOP executive director, was sentenced to seven months for his role.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRaymond alleged that James Tobin, Northeast field director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, masterminded the plot. In December 2005, Tobin was convicted of two federal felonies arising from the phone-jamming and sentenced to ten months in prison, but that conviction was reversed on appeal. In October 2008, prosecutors filed two new felony indictments charging that Tobin lied to an FBI agent when he was interviewed in 2003 about his role in the phone-jamming case.[26] These charges were summarily dismissed in 2009 after the federal judge in Maine's District Court found them motivated by \"vindictive prosecution\".[27]\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2009\nMain article: 2008 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nIn early July 2007 through UNH, CNN and WMUR put out a poll[28] showing that Shaheen would beat Sununu in the 2008 Senate race (54–38). Other Democratic candidates did not have this type of lead, which led many to believe Shaheen would be the best choice to beat Sununu.\n\n\nIn April 2007, Shaheen met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-New York) about a Senate run. Both said she would have strong support from the DSCC if she ran. On September 14, 2007, Shaheen announced her candidacy.[29] On September 15, she formally launched her campaign at her home in Madbury, New Hampshire. On September 21, EMILY's List endorsed her campaign.\n\n\nShaheen defeated Sununu 52% to 45% (44,535 votes).\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\n![](image)Shaheen, Hillary Clinton and Maggie Hassan in November 2014\nShaheen ran for reelection in 2014, facing former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.[30]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Brown announced he was forming an exploratory committee to run against Shaheen. According to the Boston Herald, \"Granite State Republicans are calling U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen a hypocrite for asking potential GOP challenger and former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown to keep \"outside\" money out of the campaign while she fills the Democratic war chest on the West Coast\".[31]\n\n\nIn June 2014, WMUR reported that Shaheen had never released her tax returns in her 18 years of public service in New Hampshire. Shaheen said she would not rule out releasing her returns, but would like to see her opponent do so first.[32]\n\n\nShe was endorsed again by Emily's List.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen, Ivanka Trump and Jim Risch in February 2019\nOn election night, even as her party lost control of the Senate, Shaheen won reelection with 51 percent of the vote to Brown's 48 percent. As a measure of how Republican New Hampshire once was, Shaheen is only the second Democrat in the state's history to win two terms in the Senate.\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nShaheen was reelected in 2020 with 56.7% of the vote to Republican nominee Bryant “Corky” Messner's 40.9%. She is the first New Hampshire Democrat elected to three full terms in the Senate. The only other Democrat to be popularly elected more than once from New Hampshire, Thomas J. McIntyre (who held the seat Shaheen currently holds), served the remainder of Styles Bridges's last term before being elected to two terms in his own right.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senator Shaheen with Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, 2010\nOn January 3, 2009, Shaheen was sworn into the United States Senate. As a senator, she has sponsored 288 bills, five of which have become law.[34]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Shaheen was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. She tweeted during the attack that she and her staff were safe and that \"We will not be stopped from doing our Constitutional duty\".[35] The day after the attack, Shaheen called Trump \"unfit for office\" and said that she supported impeaching him and removing him from office.[36]\n\n\n\n#### Health care[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen speaks on health care, 2019\nIn 2009, Shaheen partnered with U.S. Senator Susan Collins to introduce the Medicare Transitional Care Act, which provides follow-up care for discharged hospital patients to reduce re-hospitalizations.[37] The bill passed in 2010,[38] and research at the University of Pennsylvania predicted the measure would lower the cost of health care by as much as $5,000 per Medicare beneficiary while also improving health care quality and reducing re-hospitalizations.[39]\n\n\nIn December 2009, Shaheen voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; commonly called the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare).[40][41]\n\n\nIn advance of the rollout of the PPACA, Shaheen said that people who liked their current health care plans could keep them.[42] When asked about individuals who were losing their health care plans due to the PPACA, Shaheen said people could keep their health care plans if they were \"willing to pay more.\"[43]\n\n\nIn August 2019 Shaheen was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences of the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act lawsuit, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".[44]\n\n\nIn October 2019 Shaheen was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.\"[45]\n\n\n\n#### Fiscal[edit]\n\n\nOn October 11, 2011, Shaheen voted to proceed with a proposed bill that included $446 billion in spending on infrastructure and schools and provided funding for state and local governments, as well as an extension of the payroll tax deduction. The spending would have been paid for by a 5.6% surtax on incomes above $1 million. The bill failed to obtain cloture.[46]\n\n\nShaheen used an earmark in a large appropriations bill to restore funding for a federal prison in Berlin, NH, despite a $276 million recommended cut.[47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nShaheen supports making it illegal for individuals on the terrorist watchlist to buy guns[49] and voted in favor of a bill proposing to expand background checks for gun purchases.[50] She also voted to ban magazines of over 10 bullets.[51] In 2016, she participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Shaheen said that \"moments of sympathy are not enough\" and that common-sense gun laws must be enacted.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Shaheen proposed abolishing the Minerals Management Service, the U.S. government agency tasked with regulating offshore drilling, arguing that reform had been insufficient and that a new agency was needed.[53] Shaheen also proposed legislation giving the president's bipartisan BP Oil Spill Commission subpoena power in its investigation.[54] She argued that subpoena power was necessary to avoid another such disaster, emphasizing the spill's economic costs to the Gulf Coast region and the economy as a whole.[55]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2014, Shaheen introduced the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014 (S. 2262; 113th Congress), a bill intended to improve efficient energy use.[56]\n\n\nIn March 2019 Shaheen was an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill intended to mandate that the Environmental Protection Agency declare per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances that can be addressed with cleanup funds via the EPA Superfund law and require that polluters undertake or pay for remediation within a year of the bill's enaction.[57]\n\n\nShaheen opposed the Nord Stream 2, a pipeline for delivering natural gas from Russia to Germany.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Iraq War[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, when Shaheen narrowly lost to Sununu, she supported both the 2003 invasion of Iraq and \"regime change\" for Iraq.[59] Shaheen said that she came to supporting the policy of removing Saddam Hussein from power after meeting with former Clinton-administration National Security Advisor Sandy Berger. According to the *Concord Monitor* and Associated Press, the issue was a minor one in the race.\n\n\nShaheen later questioned George W. Bush's handling of the situation in Iraq. In a September 2004 televised interview as Kerry presidential campaign chair she said:[60]\n\n\n\n\n> George [W.] Bush has taken us in the wrong direction. He misled us into war in Iraq. That war has not made us safer and more secure at home ... You know, we have not stabilized Afghanistan. We have not stabilized Iraq. There is no plan to win the peace.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nOn July 28, 2004, while serving as Chair of the Kerry-Edwards Campaign, Shaheen answered questions about her prior support of the Iraq war during an interview on C-SPAN.[61]\n\n\n\n\n> George [W.] Bush said that the reason we needed to go to war in Iraq, the reason we needed to remove Saddam Hussein, was because he had weapons of mass destruction, weapons that could be used against this country, because he had ties to al-Qaeda and the terrorists who were responsible for the September 11 tragedy.\n> What we know now and what George Bush and Dick Cheney have admitted is that in fact Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. (...) The links to al-Qaeda that the president talked about were not there. (...) While I appreciate that there was an effort to make people in this country think that [there was a connection] (...) the fact is that's not true.[62]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### War in Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen and Senator Joni Ernst in a meeting with Afghan women, 2021\nShaheen opposed the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden.[63]\n\n\n\n#### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nShaheen initially opposed same-sex marriage as governor of New Hampshire, but in 2009 she came out in favor of marriage for same-sex couples and sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act.[64] She also voted in favor of the repeal of Don't ask, don't tell, and supports government recognition of same-sex spouses of military and other government personnel.[65][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Shaheen voted against Bernie Sanders's amendment to include a $15/hour minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[66]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n![Jeanne Shaheen with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and New Hampshire Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill announcing a grant that helps local farms turn commodities into value-added products.](image)Jeanne Shaheen with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and New Hampshire Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill announcing a farm grant, 2014\n![](image)Shaheen and President Joe Biden at the 2022 NATO summit, June 2022\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Defense\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support\n\t+ Subcommittee on Seapower\n* Committee on Foreign Relations\n\t+ Subcommittee on European Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on International Operations and Organizations, Human Rights, Democracy and Global Women's Issues\n\t+ Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs\n* Committee on Small Business (chair)\n* Select Committee on Ethics\n* Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Afterschool Caucuses[67]\n* Senate National Guard Caucus (co-chair)[68]\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n**Governor elections in New Hampshire: Results 1996–2000**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n |  | **Jeanne Shaheen** | 284,175\n | 57%\n |  | Ovide Lamontagne\n | 196,321\n | 40%\n |  | Fred Bramante\n | Independent Reform\n | 10,316\n | 2%\n |  | Robert Kingsbury\n | Libertarian\n | 5,974\n | 1%\n |  |\n| 1998\n |  | **Jeanne Shaheen (inc.)** | 210,769\n | 66%\n |  | Jay Lucas\n | 98,473\n | 31%\n |  | Ken Blevens\n | Libertarian\n | 8,655\n | 3%\n |  | Write-ins\n | Write-ins\n | 503\n | <1%\n |  |\n| 2000\n |  | **Jeanne Shaheen (inc.)** | 275,038\n | 49%\n |  | Gordon Humphrey\n | 246,952\n | 44%\n |  | Mary Brown\n | Independent\n | 35,904\n | 6%\n |  | John Babiarz\n | Libertarian\n | 6,446\n | 1%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate (Class II) elections in New Hampshire: Results 2002–2020[69]\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 |  | Jeanne Shaheen\n | 207,478\n | 46%\n |  | **John E.

A member of the Democratic Party, she also served as the 78th governor of New Hampshire from 1997 to 2003. Shaheen is the first woman elected as both a governor and a U.S. senator.[1]\n\n\nAfter serving two terms in the New Hampshire Senate, Shaheen was elected governor in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000. In 2002, she unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate against Republican nominee John E. Sununu. She served as director of the Harvard Institute of Politics before resigning to run for the U.S. Senate again in the 2008 election, defeating Sununu in a rematch. She is the dean of New Hampshire's congressional delegation, serving in Congress since 2009.\n\n\nShaheen became the first Democratic senator from New Hampshire since John A. Durkin, who was defeated in 1980. In 2014, she became the second Democrat from New Hampshire to be reelected to the Senate and the first since Thomas J. McIntyre in 1972. She was reelected to a third term in 2020, defeating Republican nominee Bryant Messner.\n\n\n\n\n## Personal life, education and pre-political career[edit]\n\n\nJeanne Shaheen was born Cynthia Jeanne Bowers in St. Charles, Missouri, the daughter of Belle Ernestine (Stillings) and Ivan E. Bowers.[2][*unreliable source?*] She is a 12th-generation descendant of the prominent Native American Pocahontas.[3][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nShaheen graduated from high school in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, and earned a bachelor's degree in English from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania and a master's degree in political science from the University of Mississippi.[4] She taught high school in Mississippi[5] and moved to New Hampshire in 1973, where she taught school and, with her husband, owned a store that sold used jewelry.[6] She is married to Bill Shaheen, an attorney and judge. They have three children.\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nA Democrat, she worked on several campaigns, including Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, and as the New Hampshire campaign manager for Gary Hart in 1984,[7] before running for office in 1990, when she was elected to the state Senate for the 21st district. She was elected governor of New Hampshire in 1996 and reelected in 1998 and 2000.[8]\n\n\nIn April 2005, Shaheen was named director of Harvard's Institute of Politics,[9] succeeding former U.S. Representative and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman.\n\n\n\n## Governor of New Hampshire[edit]\n\n\nShaheen's decision to run for New Hampshire governor followed the retirement of Republican Governor Steve Merrill. Her opponent in 1996 was Ovide M. Lamontagne, then chairman of the State Board of Education. Shaheen presented herself as a moderate. According to a PBS profile, she focused on education funding issues, and pledged to expand kindergarten. She defeated Lamontagne by 57 to 40 percent.[10]\n\n\nShaheen was the first woman to be elected governor of New Hampshire.[11] (She was not, however, the first woman to serve as New Hampshire's governor; Vesta M. Roy was acting governor from December 30, 1982, until January 6, 1983.)[12]\n\n\nIn 1998, she was reelected by a margin of 66 to 31 percent.[13][14]\n\n\nIn both 1996 and 1998, Shaheen took a no-new-taxes pledge. After a court decision preventing education from being largely supported by local taxes, \"her administration devised a plan that would have increased education spending and set a statewide property tax.\"[15]\n\n\nRunning for a third term in 2000, Shaheen refused to renew her no-new-taxes pledge, becoming the first New Hampshire governor in 38 years to win an election without making that pledge.[16] Shaheen's preferred solution to the school-funding problem was not a broad-based tax but legalized video-gambling at state racetracks—a solution repeatedly rejected by the state legislature.[17][18]\n\n\nIn 2001 Shaheen tried to implement a 2.5% sales tax, the first broad-based tariff of its kind in New Hampshire, which has never had a sales tax. The state legislature rejected her proposal.[19] She also proposed an increase in the state's cigarette tax and a 4.5% capital gains tax.\n\n\n\n## Presidential politics[edit]\n\n\n### 2000[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, Shaheen supported Al Gore, and her husband served as Gore's New Hampshire campaign manager. According to the *New York Observer*, the Shaheens were critical in helping Gore win a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary over Bill Bradley.[20][21]\n\n\nGore added Shaheen to his short list of potential vice presidential nominees, which also included Indiana Senator Evan Bayh, North Carolina Senator John Edwards, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, and Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman.[22] Shaheen responded to speculation by stating she wasn't interested in the job.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2004[edit]\n\n\nAfter a short time teaching at Harvard University (and a fellowship in the Institute of Politics with former Massachusetts Governor Jane Swift), Shaheen was named national chairperson of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in September 2003.\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen on the campaign trail at Dartmouth College, July 2008\n2002\nMain article: 2002 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nAfter three two-year terms as governor, Shaheen declined to run for a fourth, instead choosing to run for the U.S. Senate in 2002. Republican John E. Sununu defeated her by a 51 percent to 47 percent margin (19,751 votes). In an interview with the *Concord Monitor*, Shaheen attributed her loss in part to \"discussion about the job that [she] did as governor.\" At that time, early Republican advertisements slammed her support for putting a sales tax on the ballot or faulted her for failing schools.[24]\n\n\nIn June 2004, former Republican consultant Allen Raymond pleaded guilty to jamming Democratic Party lines set up to get New Hampshire Democrats to the polls in 2002, which some (most notably former Senator Bob Smith, whom Sununu defeated in the Republican primary) believe contributed to Shaheen's loss.[25] A judge sentenced Raymond to five months in jail in February 2005. Charles McGee, the former state GOP executive director, was sentenced to seven months for his role.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRaymond alleged that James Tobin, Northeast field director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, masterminded the plot. In December 2005, Tobin was convicted of two federal felonies arising from the phone-jamming and sentenced to ten months in prison, but that conviction was reversed on appeal. In October 2008, prosecutors filed two new felony indictments charging that Tobin lied to an FBI agent when he was interviewed in 2003 about his role in the phone-jamming case.[26] These charges were summarily dismissed in 2009 after the federal judge in Maine's District Court found them motivated by \"vindictive prosecution\".[27]\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2009\nMain article: 2008 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nIn early July 2007 through UNH, CNN and WMUR put out a poll[28] showing that Shaheen would beat Sununu in the 2008 Senate race (54–38). Other Democratic candidates did not have this type of lead, which led many to believe Shaheen would be the best choice to beat Sununu.\n\n\nIn April 2007, Shaheen met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Chuck Schumer (D-New York) about a Senate run. Both said she would have strong support from the DSCC if she ran. On September 14, 2007, Shaheen announced her candidacy.[29] On September 15, she formally launched her campaign at her home in Madbury, New Hampshire. On September 21, EMILY's List endorsed her campaign.\n\n\nShaheen defeated Sununu 52% to 45% (44,535 votes).\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\n![](image)Shaheen, Hillary Clinton and Maggie Hassan in November 2014\nShaheen ran for reelection in 2014, facing former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.[30]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Brown announced he was forming an exploratory committee to run against Shaheen. According to the Boston Herald, \"Granite State Republicans are calling U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen a hypocrite for asking potential GOP challenger and former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown to keep \"outside\" money out of the campaign while she fills the Democratic war chest on the West Coast\".[31]\n\n\nIn June 2014, WMUR reported that Shaheen had never released her tax returns in her 18 years of public service in New Hampshire. Shaheen said she would not rule out releasing her returns, but would like to see her opponent do so first.[32]\n\n\nShe was endorsed again by Emily's List.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen, Ivanka Trump and Jim Risch in February 2019\nOn election night, even as her party lost control of the Senate, Shaheen won reelection with 51 percent of the vote to Brown's 48 percent. As a measure of how Republican New Hampshire once was, Shaheen is only the second Democrat in the state's history to win two terms in the Senate.\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in New Hampshire\n\nShaheen was reelected in 2020 with 56.7% of the vote to Republican nominee Bryant “Corky” Messner's 40.9%. She is the first New Hampshire Democrat elected to three full terms in the Senate. The only other Democrat to be popularly elected more than once from New Hampshire, Thomas J. McIntyre (who held the seat Shaheen currently holds), served the remainder of Styles Bridges's last term before being elected to two terms in his own right.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senator Shaheen with Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, 2010\nOn January 3, 2009, Shaheen was sworn into the United States Senate. As a senator, she has sponsored 288 bills, five of which have become law.[34]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Shaheen was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol. She tweeted during the attack that she and her staff were safe and that \"We will not be stopped from doing our Constitutional duty\".[35] The day after the attack, Shaheen called Trump \"unfit for office\" and said that she supported impeaching him and removing him from office.[36]\n\n\n\n#### Health care[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen speaks on health care, 2019\nIn 2009, Shaheen partnered with U.S. Senator Susan Collins to introduce the Medicare Transitional Care Act, which provides follow-up care for discharged hospital patients to reduce re-hospitalizations.[37] The bill passed in 2010,[38] and research at the University of Pennsylvania predicted the measure would lower the cost of health care by as much as $5,000 per Medicare beneficiary while also improving health care quality and reducing re-hospitalizations.[39]\n\n\nIn December 2009, Shaheen voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA; commonly called the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare).[40][41]\n\n\nIn advance of the rollout of the PPACA, Shaheen said that people who liked their current health care plans could keep them.[42] When asked about individuals who were losing their health care plans due to the PPACA, Shaheen said people could keep their health care plans if they were \"willing to pay more.\"[43]\n\n\nIn August 2019 Shaheen was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences of the Texas v. United States Affordable Care Act lawsuit, writing that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".[44]\n\n\nIn October 2019 Shaheen was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans.\"[45]\n\n\n\n#### Fiscal[edit]\n\n\nOn October 11, 2011, Shaheen voted to proceed with a proposed bill that included $446 billion in spending on infrastructure and schools and provided funding for state and local governments, as well as an extension of the payroll tax deduction. The spending would have been paid for by a 5.6% surtax on incomes above $1 million. The bill failed to obtain cloture.[46]\n\n\nShaheen used an earmark in a large appropriations bill to restore funding for a federal prison in Berlin, NH, despite a $276 million recommended cut.[47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nShaheen supports making it illegal for individuals on the terrorist watchlist to buy guns[49] and voted in favor of a bill proposing to expand background checks for gun purchases.[50] She also voted to ban magazines of over 10 bullets.[51] In 2016, she participated in the Chris Murphy gun control filibuster in the wake of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Shaheen said that \"moments of sympathy are not enough\" and that common-sense gun laws must be enacted.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Shaheen proposed abolishing the Minerals Management Service, the U.S. government agency tasked with regulating offshore drilling, arguing that reform had been insufficient and that a new agency was needed.[53] Shaheen also proposed legislation giving the president's bipartisan BP Oil Spill Commission subpoena power in its investigation.[54] She argued that subpoena power was necessary to avoid another such disaster, emphasizing the spill's economic costs to the Gulf Coast region and the economy as a whole.[55]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2014, Shaheen introduced the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2014 (S. 2262; 113th Congress), a bill intended to improve efficient energy use.[56]\n\n\nIn March 2019 Shaheen was an original cosponsor of a bipartisan bill intended to mandate that the Environmental Protection Agency declare per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances that can be addressed with cleanup funds via the EPA Superfund law and require that polluters undertake or pay for remediation within a year of the bill's enaction.[57]\n\n\nShaheen opposed the Nord Stream 2, a pipeline for delivering natural gas from Russia to Germany.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Iraq War[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, when Shaheen narrowly lost to Sununu, she supported both the 2003 invasion of Iraq and \"regime change\" for Iraq.[59] Shaheen said that she came to supporting the policy of removing Saddam Hussein from power after meeting with former Clinton-administration National Security Advisor Sandy Berger. According to the *Concord Monitor* and Associated Press, the issue was a minor one in the race.\n\n\nShaheen later questioned George W. Bush's handling of the situation in Iraq. In a September 2004 televised interview as Kerry presidential campaign chair she said:[60]\n\n\n\n\n> George [W.] Bush has taken us in the wrong direction. He misled us into war in Iraq. That war has not made us safer and more secure at home ... You know, we have not stabilized Afghanistan. We have not stabilized Iraq. There is no plan to win the peace.\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nOn July 28, 2004, while serving as Chair of the Kerry-Edwards Campaign, Shaheen answered questions about her prior support of the Iraq war during an interview on C-SPAN.[61]\n\n\n\n\n> George [W.] Bush said that the reason we needed to go to war in Iraq, the reason we needed to remove Saddam Hussein, was because he had weapons of mass destruction, weapons that could be used against this country, because he had ties to al-Qaeda and the terrorists who were responsible for the September 11 tragedy.\n> What we know now and what George Bush and Dick Cheney have admitted is that in fact Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. (...) The links to al-Qaeda that the president talked about were not there. (...) While I appreciate that there was an effort to make people in this country think that [there was a connection] (...) the fact is that's not true.[62]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### War in Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shaheen and Senator Joni Ernst in a meeting with Afghan women, 2021\nShaheen opposed the 2021 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan under President Joe Biden.[63]\n\n\n\n#### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nShaheen initially opposed same-sex marriage as governor of New Hampshire, but in 2009 she came out in favor of marriage for same-sex couples and sponsored the Respect for Marriage Act.[64] She also voted in favor of the repeal of Don't ask, don't tell, and supports government recognition of same-sex spouses of military and other government personnel.[65][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Shaheen voted against Bernie Sanders's amendment to include a $15/hour minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[66]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n![Jeanne Shaheen with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and New Hampshire Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill announcing a grant that helps local farms turn commodities into value-added products.](image)Jeanne Shaheen with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and New Hampshire Agriculture Commissioner Lorraine Merrill announcing a farm grant, 2014\n![](image)Shaheen and President Joe Biden at the 2022 NATO summit, June 2022\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Defense\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support\n\t+ Subcommittee on Seapower\n* Committee on Foreign Relations\n\t+ Subcommittee on European Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on International Operations and Organizations, Human Rights, Democracy and Global Women's Issues\n\t+ Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South and Central Asian Affairs\n* Committee on Small Business (chair)\n* Select Committee on Ethics\n* Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Afterschool Caucuses[67]\n* Senate National Guard Caucus (co-chair)[68]\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n**Governor elections in New Hampshire: Results 1996–2000**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n |  | **Jeanne Shaheen** | 284,175\n | 57%\n |  | Ovide Lamontagne\n | 196,321\n | 40%\n |  | Fred Bramante\n | Independent Reform\n | 10,316\n | 2%\n |  | Robert Kingsbury\n | Libertarian\n | 5,974\n | 1%\n |  |\n| 1998\n |  | **Jeanne Shaheen (inc.)** | 210,769\n | 66%\n |  | Jay Lucas\n | 98,473\n | 31%\n |  | Ken Blevens\n | Libertarian\n | 8,655\n | 3%\n |  | Write-ins\n | Write-ins\n | 503\n | <1%\n |  |\n| 2000\n |  | **Jeanne Shaheen (inc.)** | 275,038\n | 49%\n |  | Gordon Humphrey\n | 246,952\n | 44%\n |  | Mary Brown\n | Independent\n | 35,904\n | 6%\n |  | John Babiarz\n | Libertarian\n | 6,446\n | 1%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senate (Class II) elections in New Hampshire: Results 2002–2020[69]\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 |  | Jeanne Shaheen\n | 207,478\n | 46%\n |  | **John E.

She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), an affiliate of the Democratic Party. \n\n\nBorn in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Smith moved to Minnesota in the 1980s to work for General Mills and later became the vice president of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota. She then began a career as a political consultant and organizer for Democratic candidates. Smith managed Ted Mondale's unsuccessful bid for governor of Minnesota in 1998 and Walter Mondale's unsuccessful last-minute campaign in the 2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota after incumbent senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash 11 days before the election.[2]\n\n\nAfter Walter Mondale lost, Smith served as chief of staff to Mayor of Minneapolis R. T. Rybak. She then helped run Mark Dayton's successful campaign for Governor of Minnesota in 2010. After his extremely close victory, Dayton named Smith his chief of staff. Later, for Dayton's reelection campaign in the 2014 election, Smith was named as Dayton's pick for lieutenant governor.[3] After winning her first election to public office, Smith served as the 48th lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 2015 to 2018. Dayton appointed her to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Al Franken's resignation in 2018. She won the 2018 special election and was elected to a full term in 2020.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSmith was born on March 4, 1958,[5] in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the daughter of Christine, a teacher, and F. Harlan Flint, a lawyer.[6] She mostly grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, attending Manderfield and Acequia Madre Elementary.[7] She finished high school in Northern California.[6]\n\n\nBefore going to college, Smith worked on the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. She graduated from Stanford University with a degree in political science, and later earned a master's degree in business administration from Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.[8]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, Smith moved to Minnesota for a marketing job at General Mills.[9] She later started her own marketing firm, where she consulted with businesses and nonprofits.[10]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Smith became involved in local politics, volunteering for DFL campaigns in Minneapolis.[11] She managed Ted Mondale's unsuccessful 1998 campaign for governor. After Minnesota's U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash weeks before the 2002 election, Smith managed former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale's campaign for the seat.[12] After Mondale lost a narrow election to Norm Coleman, Smith began working as the vice president of external affairs at Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.[13]\n\n\nIn 2006, Smith left her job at Planned Parenthood to serve as chief of staff to Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak.[14] In 2010 she was picked to manage Rybak's gubernatorial campaign, which ended after Margaret Anderson Kelliher won the DFL endorsement.[12] Smith then joined the campaign of Mark Dayton, who skipped the endorsing convention and eventually won the DFL primary.[11] After Dayton defeated Republican Tom Emmer in the general election, Smith was named a co-chair of the transition. When Dayton took office in January 2011, he appointed Smith his chief of staff.[15]\n\n\n\n## Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota[edit]\n\n\n### 2014 election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2014 Minnesota gubernatorial election\n\nWhen Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon announced she would not seek reelection, Dayton selected Smith as his running mate in the 2014 gubernatorial election. He cited Smith's work on passing legislation for new Minnesota Vikings Stadium, as well as her support for the Destination Medical Center project with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.[15]\n\n\nSmith stepped down as Dayton's chief of staff to campaign for lieutenant governor. After being nominated by acclamation at the DFL state convention, and facing only token opposition in the DFL gubernatorial primary, Dayton and Smith defeated Republicans Jeff Johnson and Bill Kuisle in the general election.[16]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith in 2016\nSmith took office as lieutenant governor on January 5, 2015, and served until she was appointed to represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate on January 2, 2018.[17] During her tenure Smith was described by many political observers as having a much higher profile and playing a much more significant role in legislative negotiations than her predecessors.[9][18] She spent a significant amount of time traveling the state in support of the priorities of Dayton's administration, including funding for optional preschool for all four-year-olds, transportation infrastructure, and rural broadband internet access. She also served as chair of the Destination Medical Center board until her resignation in December 2017.[19][20]\n\n\nIn 2016 *Roll Call* named Smith to its \"America's Top 25 Most Influential Women in State Politics\" list, citing her high-profile role in the Dayton administration.[21]\n\n\nDespite widespread speculation to the contrary, Smith announced in March 2017 that she would not run for governor in the 2018 election.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dayton appointing Smith to the Senate\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2017, Governor Dayton announced Smith as his pick to fill the United States Senate seat held by Al Franken, who had announced he would resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct.[24][25] Democrats in the state immediately united around Smith as the party's candidate in the November 2018 special election to fill Franken's term.[26]\n\n\nFranken officially resigned on January 2, 2018.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018 Special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate special election in Minnesota\n\nIn August 2018, Smith won the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party primary with 76% of the vote. Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, finished second with 14%.[29][30]\n\n\nIn the November general election, Smith defeated Republican nominee Karin Housley, a state senator from St. Marys Point, with 53% of the vote to Housley's 42%.[31][32]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nMinnesota was seen as a swing state in the 2020 presidential election, which made Smith a swing-state Democrat up for reelection. Her campaign focused on delivering results for Minnesotans on local issues, such as farming in southern Minnesota, police brutality in wake of the George Floyd protests and North Shore drilling in the Duluth area, and took strong positions on national issues such as the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination. Smith defeated Republican nominee Jason Lewis with 48.8% of the vote to Lewis's 43.5%, thus winning her first full six-year Senate term.[33]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nWith Vice President Mike Pence administering the oath of office, Smith was officially sworn in as a U.S. Senator on January 3, 2018,[34] alongside Doug Jones of Alabama. She was accompanied by fellow Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President and former Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale.[35]\n\n\nSmith was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. She called the participants in the attack \"seditionists\" and blamed Trump for inciting the attack. When the Capitol was secure and the Congress returned to session, Smith supported the certification of the count.[36] In response to the insurrection, she called for Trump's immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and impeachment, saying that the president needed to be held accountable for the attack and that \"he is dangerous to our democracy and to public safety.\"[37][38] She said that Representatives Michelle Fischbach and Jim Hagedorn, who objected to certifying the election, \"were complicit in pushing for the president's big lie\",[37] and also called on Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to resign for objecting to the certification of the election and spreading falsehoods about election integrity.[39]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management and Trade\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy (Chair)\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n\n\n[40][41][42][43][44][45]\n\n\nSmith previously served on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from January 10, 2018 to January 3, 2019, during the first session of the 116th Congress.\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nSmith supports abortion rights. She was a vice president at Planned Parenthood from 2003 to 2006, where she lobbied against efforts to oppose abortion rights.[46][47]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Smith voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, saying that the bill \"would override physicians' professional judgment about what is best for their patients\" and \"put physicians in the position of facing criminal penalties if their judgment about what is best for their patient is contrary to what is described in this bill.\"[48]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, just after Politico obtained and released a 98-page U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion striking down *Roe v. Wade*, Smith responded in a tweet, \"This is bullshit.\"[49] After the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade* on June 24, Senators Smith and Elizabeth Warren wrote a *New York Times* op-ed calling on President Joe Biden to unblock \"critical resources and authority that states and the federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health services.\"[50]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Smith and 37 other senators signed a letter to US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program.\"[51]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Smith and 24 other Democratic senators cosponsored a resolution in response to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action to address climate change.[52]\n\n\n\n### Digital assets[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2021 letter, Smith and four colleagues wrote to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to criticize the company's Diem digital currency project. In the letter, they argued that \"stablecoins in general\" are \"incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape.\"[53] In 2022, Smith and Elizabeth Warren wrote to Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson to object to a plan to allow for the inclusion of Bitcoin in their 401(k)s.[54]\n\n\n\n### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Smith and 20 other senators signed a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the Food and Drug Administration's actions to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA \"to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth.\"[55]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Smith introduced the Substance Regulation and Safety Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level and direct federal agencies to develop various regulations regarding cannabis.[56] During a floor speech on racial justice, she called for passage of the bill along with the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to end the \"failed policy\" of cannabis prohibition that \"contributes to mass incarceration and over-policing of communities of color\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Smith and 33 other senators signed a letter to then-President Donald Trump asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\". The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries decreased migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[58]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2018 Smith and nine other senators signed a letter to Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Lamar Alexander and ranking Democrat Patty Murray requesting they schedule a hearing on the causes and remedies of mass shootings in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[59]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 elections, Smith said her record in the Senate showed she would fight pharmaceutical companies to improve people's lives, and that she would continue to fight to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs in Minnesota, for example by making generic drugs more available, preventing people with preexisting conditions from being charged more, and allowing Minnesotans to buy in to Medicare if they are dissatisfied with their options on the insurance market.[60] Smith has endorsed single-payer healthcare.[61]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Smith and 41 other senators signed a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\"[62]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Smith and 33 other senators signed a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the shutdown's effect on public health and employees while remaining alarmed \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[63]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Smith and ten other senators signed a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi about their increased insulin prices having deprived patients of \"access to the life-saving medications they need.\"[64]\n\n\n\n### Housing and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Smith and 40 other senators signed a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[65]\n\n\nIn June 2019 Smith was one of eight senators to sponsor the Made in America Act, legislation that would designate federal programs that had funded infrastructure projects not currently subject to Buy America standards and mandate that the materials used in these programs be domestically produced. Bill cosponsor Tammy Baldwin said the bill would strengthen Buy America requirements and that she was hopeful both Democrats and Republicans would support \"this effort to make sure our government is buying American products and supporting American workers.\"[66]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Smith was one of 17 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Kamala Harris to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\"[67]\n\n\nIn July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to cease protecting spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Smith was one of 22 senators led by Tammy Duckworth to sign a letter arguing that the protection gave service members the ability \"to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away\" and that its termination would both cause service members personal hardship and negatively affect their combat performance.[68]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Smith and 19 other senators signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQ individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"[69]\n\n\n\n### Railroad safety[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Smith and nine other senators cosponsored the Safe Freight Act, a bill that would require freight trains to have one or more certified conductors and a certified engineer on board who can collaborate on how to protect the train and people living near the tracks. The legislation was meant to correct a Federal Railroad Administration rollback of a proposed rule intended to establish safety standards.[70]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSmith's husband, Archie Smith, is an independent investor, focusing largely on health care and medical companies.[71] The couple have two sons.[72]\n\n\nIn May 2019, during a speech on the Senate floor, Smith described her experiences with getting help in college and in her early 30s for depression.[73]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary election results[74]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Mark Dayton/Tina Smith**  | **177,849**  | **92.99**  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Leslie Davis/Gregor Soderberg\n | 8,530\n | 4.46\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Bill Dahn/James Vigliotti\n | 4,880\n | 2.55\n |\n| Total votes\n | **191,259**  | **100**  |\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota gubernatorial election, 2014[75]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Mark Dayton/Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **989,113**  | **50.07%**  | **+6.44%**  |\n|  | Republican | Jeff Johnson/Bill Kuisle\n | 879,257\n | 44.51%\n | +1.30%\n |\n|  | Independence | Hannah Nicollet/Tim Gieseke\n | 56,900\n | 2.88%\n | -9.06%\n |\n|  | Grassroots | Chris Wright/David Daniels\n | 31,259\n | 1.58%\n | +1.22%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Chris Holbrook/Chris Dock\n | 18,082\n | 0.92%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 795\n | 0.04%\n | -0.05%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,975,406**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic–Farmer–Labor Party primary results, Minnesota 2018[76]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **433,705**  | **76.06%**  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Richard Painter\n | 78,193\n | 13.71%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Ali Chehem Ali\n | 18,897\n | 3.31%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Gregg Iverson\n | 17,825\n | 3.13%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Nick Leonard\n | 16,529\n | 2.90%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Christopher Seymore\n | 5,041\n | 0.88%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **570,190**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Minnesota, 2018[77]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **1,370,540**  | **52.97%**  | **-0.18%**  |\n|  | Republican | Karin Housley\n | 1,095,777\n | 42.35%\n | -0.56%\n |\n|  | Legal Marijuana Now | Sarah Wellington\n | 95,614\n | 3.70%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Jerry Trooien\n | 24,324\n | 0.94%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 1,101\n | 0.04%\n | N/A\n |\n| Total votes\n | **2,587,356**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic–Farmer–Labor Party primary results, Minnesota, 2020\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **497,498**  | **87.1%**  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Paula Overby\n | 30,497\n | 5.3%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Ahmad Hassan\n | 20,037\n | 3.5%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Steve Carlson\n | 16,429\n | 2.9%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Christopher Seymore\n | 6,480\n | 1.1%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **570,941**  | **100.0%**  |\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate election in Minnesota, 2020[78]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **1,566,522**  | **48.74%**  | **-4.23%**  |\n|  | Republican | Jason Lewis | 1,398,145\n | 43.50%\n | +1.15%\n |\n|  | Legal Marijuana Now | Kevin O'Connor\n | 190,154\n | 5.91%\n | +2.21%\n |\n|  | Grassroots | Oliver Steinberg\n | 57,174\n | 1.78%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 2,261\n | 0.07%\n | +0.03%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **3,214,256**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of female lieutenant governors in the United States\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Flint, Edward Frances; Flint, Gwendolyn Slaughter (December 16, 1984). *Flint family history of the adventuresome seven*.

She is a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL), an affiliate of the Democratic Party. \n\n\nBorn in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Smith moved to Minnesota in the 1980s to work for General Mills and later became the vice president of Planned Parenthood of Minnesota. She then began a career as a political consultant and organizer for Democratic candidates. Smith managed Ted Mondale's unsuccessful bid for governor of Minnesota in 1998 and Walter Mondale's unsuccessful last-minute campaign in the 2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota after incumbent senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash 11 days before the election.[2]\n\n\nAfter Walter Mondale lost, Smith served as chief of staff to Mayor of Minneapolis R. T. Rybak. She then helped run Mark Dayton's successful campaign for Governor of Minnesota in 2010. After his extremely close victory, Dayton named Smith his chief of staff. Later, for Dayton's reelection campaign in the 2014 election, Smith was named as Dayton's pick for lieutenant governor.[3] After winning her first election to public office, Smith served as the 48th lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 2015 to 2018. Dayton appointed her to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Al Franken's resignation in 2018. She won the 2018 special election and was elected to a full term in 2020.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSmith was born on March 4, 1958,[5] in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the daughter of Christine, a teacher, and F. Harlan Flint, a lawyer.[6] She mostly grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, attending Manderfield and Acequia Madre Elementary.[7] She finished high school in Northern California.[6]\n\n\nBefore going to college, Smith worked on the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. She graduated from Stanford University with a degree in political science, and later earned a master's degree in business administration from Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.[8]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, Smith moved to Minnesota for a marketing job at General Mills.[9] She later started her own marketing firm, where she consulted with businesses and nonprofits.[10]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Smith became involved in local politics, volunteering for DFL campaigns in Minneapolis.[11] She managed Ted Mondale's unsuccessful 1998 campaign for governor. After Minnesota's U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash weeks before the 2002 election, Smith managed former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale's campaign for the seat.[12] After Mondale lost a narrow election to Norm Coleman, Smith began working as the vice president of external affairs at Planned Parenthood of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.[13]\n\n\nIn 2006, Smith left her job at Planned Parenthood to serve as chief of staff to Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak.[14] In 2010 she was picked to manage Rybak's gubernatorial campaign, which ended after Margaret Anderson Kelliher won the DFL endorsement.[12] Smith then joined the campaign of Mark Dayton, who skipped the endorsing convention and eventually won the DFL primary.[11] After Dayton defeated Republican Tom Emmer in the general election, Smith was named a co-chair of the transition. When Dayton took office in January 2011, he appointed Smith his chief of staff.[15]\n\n\n\n## Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota[edit]\n\n\n### 2014 election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2014 Minnesota gubernatorial election\n\nWhen Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon announced she would not seek reelection, Dayton selected Smith as his running mate in the 2014 gubernatorial election. He cited Smith's work on passing legislation for new Minnesota Vikings Stadium, as well as her support for the Destination Medical Center project with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester.[15]\n\n\nSmith stepped down as Dayton's chief of staff to campaign for lieutenant governor. After being nominated by acclamation at the DFL state convention, and facing only token opposition in the DFL gubernatorial primary, Dayton and Smith defeated Republicans Jeff Johnson and Bill Kuisle in the general election.[16]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith in 2016\nSmith took office as lieutenant governor on January 5, 2015, and served until she was appointed to represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate on January 2, 2018.[17] During her tenure Smith was described by many political observers as having a much higher profile and playing a much more significant role in legislative negotiations than her predecessors.[9][18] She spent a significant amount of time traveling the state in support of the priorities of Dayton's administration, including funding for optional preschool for all four-year-olds, transportation infrastructure, and rural broadband internet access. She also served as chair of the Destination Medical Center board until her resignation in December 2017.[19][20]\n\n\nIn 2016 *Roll Call* named Smith to its \"America's Top 25 Most Influential Women in State Politics\" list, citing her high-profile role in the Dayton administration.[21]\n\n\nDespite widespread speculation to the contrary, Smith announced in March 2017 that she would not run for governor in the 2018 election.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dayton appointing Smith to the Senate\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2017, Governor Dayton announced Smith as his pick to fill the United States Senate seat held by Al Franken, who had announced he would resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct.[24][25] Democrats in the state immediately united around Smith as the party's candidate in the November 2018 special election to fill Franken's term.[26]\n\n\nFranken officially resigned on January 2, 2018.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018 Special[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate special election in Minnesota\n\nIn August 2018, Smith won the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party primary with 76% of the vote. Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer during the George W. Bush administration, finished second with 14%.[29][30]\n\n\nIn the November general election, Smith defeated Republican nominee Karin Housley, a state senator from St. Marys Point, with 53% of the vote to Housley's 42%.[31][32]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in Minnesota\n\nMinnesota was seen as a swing state in the 2020 presidential election, which made Smith a swing-state Democrat up for reelection. Her campaign focused on delivering results for Minnesotans on local issues, such as farming in southern Minnesota, police brutality in wake of the George Floyd protests and North Shore drilling in the Duluth area, and took strong positions on national issues such as the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination. Smith defeated Republican nominee Jason Lewis with 48.8% of the vote to Lewis's 43.5%, thus winning her first full six-year Senate term.[33]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nWith Vice President Mike Pence administering the oath of office, Smith was officially sworn in as a U.S. Senator on January 3, 2018,[34] alongside Doug Jones of Alabama. She was accompanied by fellow Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President and former Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale.[35]\n\n\nSmith was participating in the certification of the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count on January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. She called the participants in the attack \"seditionists\" and blamed Trump for inciting the attack. When the Capitol was secure and the Congress returned to session, Smith supported the certification of the count.[36] In response to the insurrection, she called for Trump's immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and impeachment, saying that the president needed to be held accountable for the attack and that \"he is dangerous to our democracy and to public safety.\"[37][38] She said that Representatives Michelle Fischbach and Jim Hagedorn, who objected to certifying the election, \"were complicit in pushing for the president's big lie\",[37] and also called on Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley to resign for objecting to the certification of the election and spreading falsehoods about election integrity.[39]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commodities, Risk Management and Trade\n\t+ Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, Poultry, Local Food Systems, and Food Safety and Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy (Chair)\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n\n\n[40][41][42][43][44][45]\n\n\nSmith previously served on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from January 10, 2018 to January 3, 2019, during the first session of the 116th Congress.\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nSmith supports abortion rights. She was a vice president at Planned Parenthood from 2003 to 2006, where she lobbied against efforts to oppose abortion rights.[46][47]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Smith voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, saying that the bill \"would override physicians' professional judgment about what is best for their patients\" and \"put physicians in the position of facing criminal penalties if their judgment about what is best for their patient is contrary to what is described in this bill.\"[48]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, just after Politico obtained and released a 98-page U.S. Supreme Court draft opinion striking down *Roe v. Wade*, Smith responded in a tweet, \"This is bullshit.\"[49] After the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade* on June 24, Senators Smith and Elizabeth Warren wrote a *New York Times* op-ed calling on President Joe Biden to unblock \"critical resources and authority that states and the federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health services.\"[50]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Smith and 37 other senators signed a letter to US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program.\"[51]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Smith and 24 other Democratic senators cosponsored a resolution in response to findings of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) report and National Climate Assessment. The resolution affirmed the senators' acceptance of the findings and their support for bold action to address climate change.[52]\n\n\n\n### Digital assets[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2021 letter, Smith and four colleagues wrote to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to criticize the company's Diem digital currency project. In the letter, they argued that \"stablecoins in general\" are \"incompatible with the actual financial regulatory landscape.\"[53] In 2022, Smith and Elizabeth Warren wrote to Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson to object to a plan to allow for the inclusion of Bitcoin in their 401(k)s.[54]\n\n\n\n### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Smith and 20 other senators signed a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb stating their approval of the Food and Drug Administration's actions to hinder youth access to e-cigarettes and urging the FDA \"to take additional, stronger steps to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use among youth.\"[55]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Smith introduced the Substance Regulation and Safety Act to legalize cannabis at the federal level and direct federal agencies to develop various regulations regarding cannabis.[56] During a floor speech on racial justice, she called for passage of the bill along with the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act to end the \"failed policy\" of cannabis prohibition that \"contributes to mass incarceration and over-policing of communities of color\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Smith and 33 other senators signed a letter to then-President Donald Trump asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that by preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\". The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries decreased migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[58]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2018 Smith and nine other senators signed a letter to Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Lamar Alexander and ranking Democrat Patty Murray requesting they schedule a hearing on the causes and remedies of mass shootings in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[59]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the 2018 elections, Smith said her record in the Senate showed she would fight pharmaceutical companies to improve people's lives, and that she would continue to fight to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs in Minnesota, for example by making generic drugs more available, preventing people with preexisting conditions from being charged more, and allowing Minnesotans to buy in to Medicare if they are dissatisfied with their options on the insurance market.[60] Smith has endorsed single-payer healthcare.[61]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Smith and 41 other senators signed a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \"increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.\" The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress.\"[62]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown, Smith and 33 other senators signed a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the efforts of the FDA to address the shutdown's effect on public health and employees while remaining alarmed \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[63]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Smith and ten other senators signed a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi about their increased insulin prices having deprived patients of \"access to the life-saving medications they need.\"[64]\n\n\n\n### Housing and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Smith and 40 other senators signed a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that President Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[65]\n\n\nIn June 2019 Smith was one of eight senators to sponsor the Made in America Act, legislation that would designate federal programs that had funded infrastructure projects not currently subject to Buy America standards and mandate that the materials used in these programs be domestically produced. Bill cosponsor Tammy Baldwin said the bill would strengthen Buy America requirements and that she was hopeful both Democrats and Republicans would support \"this effort to make sure our government is buying American products and supporting American workers.\"[66]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Smith was one of 17 senators to sign a letter spearheaded by Kamala Harris to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying \"trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection.\"[67]\n\n\nIn July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to cease protecting spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Smith was one of 22 senators led by Tammy Duckworth to sign a letter arguing that the protection gave service members the ability \"to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away\" and that its termination would both cause service members personal hardship and negatively affect their combat performance.[68]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2018, Smith and 19 other senators signed a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQ individuals \"subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities\" and that refusing to let LGBTQ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding \"the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.\"[69]\n\n\n\n### Railroad safety[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Smith and nine other senators cosponsored the Safe Freight Act, a bill that would require freight trains to have one or more certified conductors and a certified engineer on board who can collaborate on how to protect the train and people living near the tracks. The legislation was meant to correct a Federal Railroad Administration rollback of a proposed rule intended to establish safety standards.[70]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSmith's husband, Archie Smith, is an independent investor, focusing largely on health care and medical companies.[71] The couple have two sons.[72]\n\n\nIn May 2019, during a speech on the Senate floor, Smith described her experiences with getting help in college and in her early 30s for depression.[73]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2014 Democratic gubernatorial primary election results[74]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Mark Dayton/Tina Smith**  | **177,849**  | **92.99**  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Leslie Davis/Gregor Soderberg\n | 8,530\n | 4.46\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Bill Dahn/James Vigliotti\n | 4,880\n | 2.55\n |\n| Total votes\n | **191,259**  | **100**  |\n\n\n\n\nMinnesota gubernatorial election, 2014[75]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Mark Dayton/Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **989,113**  | **50.07%**  | **+6.44%**  |\n|  | Republican | Jeff Johnson/Bill Kuisle\n | 879,257\n | 44.51%\n | +1.30%\n |\n|  | Independence | Hannah Nicollet/Tim Gieseke\n | 56,900\n | 2.88%\n | -9.06%\n |\n|  | Grassroots | Chris Wright/David Daniels\n | 31,259\n | 1.58%\n | +1.22%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Chris Holbrook/Chris Dock\n | 18,082\n | 0.92%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 795\n | 0.04%\n | -0.05%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,975,406**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic–Farmer–Labor Party primary results, Minnesota 2018[76]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **433,705**  | **76.06%**  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Richard Painter\n | 78,193\n | 13.71%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Ali Chehem Ali\n | 18,897\n | 3.31%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Gregg Iverson\n | 17,825\n | 3.13%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Nick Leonard\n | 16,529\n | 2.90%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Christopher Seymore\n | 5,041\n | 0.88%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **570,190**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Minnesota, 2018[77]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **1,370,540**  | **52.97%**  | **-0.18%**  |\n|  | Republican | Karin Housley\n | 1,095,777\n | 42.35%\n | -0.56%\n |\n|  | Legal Marijuana Now | Sarah Wellington\n | 95,614\n | 3.70%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Independent | Jerry Trooien\n | 24,324\n | 0.94%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 1,101\n | 0.04%\n | N/A\n |\n| Total votes\n | **2,587,356**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** |\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic–Farmer–Labor Party primary results, Minnesota, 2020\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **497,498**  | **87.1%**  |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Paula Overby\n | 30,497\n | 5.3%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Ahmad Hassan\n | 20,037\n | 3.5%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Steve Carlson\n | 16,429\n | 2.9%\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) | Christopher Seymore\n | 6,480\n | 1.1%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **570,941**  | **100.0%**  |\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate election in Minnesota, 2020[78]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic (DFL)** | **Tina Smith (incumbent)**  | **1,566,522**  | **48.74%**  | **-4.23%**  |\n|  | Republican | Jason Lewis | 1,398,145\n | 43.50%\n | +1.15%\n |\n|  | Legal Marijuana Now | Kevin O'Connor\n | 190,154\n | 5.91%\n | +2.21%\n |\n|  | Grassroots | Oliver Steinberg\n | 57,174\n | 1.78%\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 2,261\n | 0.07%\n | +0.03%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **3,214,256**  | **100.0%**  | N/A\n |\n|  | Democratic (DFL) **hold** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of female lieutenant governors in the United States\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Flint, Edward Frances; Flint, Gwendolyn Slaughter (December 16, 1984). *Flint family history of the adventuresome seven*.

A former member of the Democratic Party, Sinema became an independent in December 2022.[2][3][4][5][6]\n\n\nSinema served three terms as a state representative for the 15th legislative district from 2005 to 2011, one term as the state senator for the 15th legislative district from 2011 to 2012, and three terms as the United States representative for the 9th district from 2013 to 2019. She began her political career in the Arizona Green Party and rose to prominence for her progressive advocacy, supporting causes such as LGBT rights and opposing the war on terror. She left the Green Party to join the Arizona Democratic Party in 2004 and was elected to a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2012. After her election, she joined the New Democrat Coalition, the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, amassing one of the most conservative voting records in the Democratic caucus.[7] Sinema won the 2018 Senate election to replace the retiring Jeff Flake, defeating Republican nominee Martha McSally. She is the first bisexual and the second LGBT woman (after Tammy Baldwin) to be elected to Congress, in the House of Representatives in 2012 and in the Senate in 2018.[8] She is also the first woman elected to the Senate from Arizona[9] and the only religiously unaffiliated member of Congress.[10]\n\n\nSinema is considered a key swing vote in the Senate,[11][12][13][14] which was split 50–50 between Democrats and Republicans in the 117th U.S. Congress. She is one of three independents in the Senate, the others being Bernie Sanders and Angus King, both of whom also caucus with the Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSinema was born in Tucson, Arizona, on July 12, 1976,[15] to Marilyn (Wiley) and Dan Sinema.[16][17] Sinema has an older brother and younger sister.[18][19] Her father was an attorney. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother, who had custody of the children, remarried. With her siblings, mother, and stepfather, Sinema moved to DeFuniak Springs, Florida, a small town in the Panhandle.[19]\n\n\nWhen her stepfather lost his job and the bank foreclosed on their home, the family lived for three years in an abandoned gas station.[20] Sinema has said that for two years they had no toilet or electricity while living there.[21] She later recalled, \"My stepdad built a bunkbed for me and my sister. We separated our bunkbed from the kitchen with one of those big chalkboards on rollers. I knew that was weird. A chalkboard shouldn't be a wall. A kitchen should have running water.\"[21]\n\n\nAccording to journalist Jonathan Martin in *The New York Times*, Sinema has given \"contradictory answers about her early life\", and her mother and stepfather have filed court documents saying they had made monthly payments for gas, electricity, and phone bills, even though Sinema had said they had been \"without running water or electricity\".[22] Asked whether she had embellished details from her childhood, Sinema said, \"I've shared what I remember from my childhood. I know what I lived through.\"[22]\n\n\nSinema was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).[23] She graduated as valedictorian from Walton High School in DeFuniak Springs at age 16 and earned her B.A. from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1995 at age 18.[24][20] She left the LDS Church after graduating from BYU.[23] Sinema returned to Arizona in 1995.[25]\n\n\nWhile employed as a social worker, Sinema completed a Master of Social Work degree at Arizona State University in 1999. In 2004, she earned a J.D. degree from Arizona State University College of Law and started working as a criminal defense lawyer.[20][26] In 2012, she earned a Ph.D. in justice studies from Arizona State[20][27] and in 2018, she completed an online M.B.A. from the W. P. Carey School of Business.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Sinema became an adjunct professor teaching master's-level policy and grant-writing classes at Arizona State University School of Social Work and an adjunct business law professor at Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as Phoenix School of Law.[30] Sinema began her political career in the Arizona Green Party before joining the Arizona Democratic Party in 2004,[31] and called herself a \"Prada socialist\".[32][33]\n\n\nIn 2000, Sinema worked on Ralph Nader's presidential campaign.[34] In 2001 and 2002, she ran for local elected offices as an independent and lost.[25] In 2002, *The Arizona Republic* published a letter from Sinema criticizing capitalism. She wrote: \"Until the average American realizes that capitalism damages her livelihood while augmenting the livelihoods of the wealthy, the Almighty Dollar will continue to rule.\"[35] In 2003, she protested Joe Lieberman's unsuccessful 2004 presidential bid, telling the *Hartford Courant*: \"He's a shame to Democrats. I don't even know why he's running. He seems to want to get Republicans voting for him – what kind of strategy is that?\"[36][37]\n\n\nWhile in the Green Party, Sinema was its local spokesperson, working to repeal the death penalty and organizing antiwar protests.[38] She had organized 15 antiwar rallies by the time the Iraq War began.[25] She also opposed the war in Afghanistan.[25] During a February 15, 2003, protest in Patriots Square Park in Phoenix, a group led by Sinema distributed flyers portraying a U.S. service member as a skeleton \"inflicting 'U.S. terror' in Iraq and the Middle East\".[25]\n\n\nIn a 2003 opinion piece, Sinema wrote that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were \"the real Saddam and Osama lovers\".[39] When asked on a local radio show whether she would oppose someone joining the Taliban and fighting on its behalf, Sinema responded: \"Fine ... I don't care if you want to do that, go ahead.\"[25]\n\n\nIn a 2011 address to Netroots Nation, Sinema called Arizona the \"meth lab of democracy\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Arizona State Legislature[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![Sinema walking up stairs and smiling to the camera](image)Sinema in 2009\nIn 2002, Sinema first ran for the Arizona House of Representatives as an independent affiliated with the Arizona Green Party.[41] She finished in last place in a five-candidate field, receiving 8 percent of the vote.[42]\n\n\nSinema joined the Democratic Party in 2004.[31] That year, Sinema and David Lujan won the two seats for Arizona's 15th district, with 37 percent of the vote for Sinema and 34 percent for Lujan over incumbent representative Wally Straughn.[43] Sinema was subsequently reelected three times with over 30 percent of the vote.[44][45][46] In 2008, Sinema completed the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government program for senior executives in state and local government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow. In 2009 and 2010, Sinema was an assistant Minority Leader for the Democratic Caucus of the Arizona House of Representatives.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sinema in 2010\nIn 2010, Sinema was elected to the Arizona Senate, defeating Republican Bob Thomas, 63 to 37 percent.[48]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Elle*, \"her first public comment as an elected official came in 2005, after a Republican colleague's speech insulted LGBT people. 'We're simply people like everyone else who want and deserve respect', she passionately declared. Later, when reporters asked about her use of the first person, Sinema replied, 'Duh, I'm bisexual.'\"[19] In 2012, when running for U.S. House, Sinema said she did not remember disclosing her sexual orientation in 2005 and declined to discuss the significance of being the first openly bisexual member of the House.[49]\n\n\nIn 2006, Sinema told a radio host that she was \"the most liberal member of the Arizona State Legislature\".[50] Also in 2006, she sponsored a bill urging the adoption of the DREAM Act,[51] and co-chaired Arizona Together, the statewide campaign that defeated Proposition 107, which would have banned the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona. In 2008, a similar referendum, Proposition 102, passed.[52]\n\n\nIn 2006, Sinema was asked about \"new feminism\", and responded: \"These women who act like staying at home, leeching off their husbands or boyfriends, and just cashing the checks is some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life. That's bullshit. I mean, what the fuck are we really talking about here?\"[53][54][55] After facing criticism, Sinema apologized and said the interview format was intended to be a \"lighthearted spoof\", adding: \"I was raised by a stay-at-home mom. So she did a pretty good job with me.\"[56]\n\n\nSinema campaigned against Proposition 107, a referendum to ban the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona.[57] In 2008, she led the campaign against Proposition 102, another referendum that would have banned the recognition of same-sex marriage in Arizona. Proposition 102 was approved with 56% of the vote in the general election on November 4, 2008. Sinema chaired a coalition called Protect Arizona's Freedom, which defeated Ward Connerly's goal to place an initiative on the state ballot that would eliminate racial-preference programs.[58][59]\n\n\nIn June 2009, Sinema was one of 32 state legislators appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Health Reform Task Force, which helped shape the Affordable Care Act.[60] \"Thanks in part to her hard work in improving the bill\", she was invited to attend the Obamacare bill signing at the White House in March 2010.[61]\n\n\nIn 2010, Sinema sponsored a bill to give in-state tuition to veterans; it was held in committee and did not receive a vote.[62] Also in 2010, Sinema was named one of *Time* magazine's \"40 Under 40\".[63] The Center for Inquiry gave Sinema its Award for the Advancement of Science and Reason in Public Policy in 2011.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinema's official portrait as U.S. Representative in 2013\nMain article: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona § District 9\n\nIn June 2011, Sinema said she was considering running for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. She lived in the same Phoenix neighborhood as incumbent Democratic congressman Ed Pastor, but was adamant that she would not challenge another Democrat in a primary.[65] On January 3, 2012, Sinema announced her bid for Congress, in the 9th congressional district.[66] The district had previously been the 5th, represented by freshman Republican David Schweikert; it contained 60 percent of the old 5th's territory.[67] Schweikert had been drawn into the 6th district—the old 3rd district—and sought reelection there.\n\n\nAlthough Sinema was not required to resign her State Senate seat under Arizona's resign-to-run laws (since she was in the final year of her term), she did so on the same day that she announced her candidacy. On August 28, 2012, Sinema won the three-way Democratic primary with nearly 42 percent of the vote. Her opponents, state Senator David Schapira and former Arizona Democratic Party chairman Andrei Cherny, a former speechwriter in the Clinton administration, each finished with less than 30 percent of the vote.[20][68][69]\n\n\nIn the general election, Sinema ran against Republican nominee Vernon Parker, the former mayor of Paradise Valley.[20] She was endorsed by *The Arizona Republic*.[20] The campaign was described as a \"nasty\",[70] \"bitterly fought race that featured millions of dollars in attack ads\".[71] Parker ran campaign ads that accused Sinema of being an \"anti-American hippie\" who practiced \"Pagan rituals\".[72] The Republican-aligned outside group American Future Fund spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on attack ads against Sinema.[54] When her religious views were raised as an issue, her campaign said that she simply believes in a secular approach to government.[73]\n\n\nThe November 6 election was initially too close to call, because Arizona election authorities failed to count more than 25 percent of the votes on election day.[74] Sinema held a narrow lead over Parker, while provisional and absentee ballots were still being counted.[75][76] On November 12, when it was apparent that Sinema's lead was too large for Parker to overcome, the Associated Press called the race for Sinema.[77]\n\n\nOnce all ballots were counted, Sinema won by 4 percentage points, over 10,000 votes. Libertarian Powell Gammill finished third with 7 percent of the votes.[78]\n\n\nSinema is the first openly bisexual person and second openly LGBT woman (after Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin) elected to the United States Congress.[79]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona § District 9\n\nSinema ran for reelection in 2014 and was unopposed in the Democratic primary, which took place on August 26, 2014. She faced Republican Wendy Rogers in the general election.[80][81]\n\n\nAccording to *Roll Call*, Sinema considered herself bipartisan. It was drawn as a \"fair-fight\" district, and President Barack Obama won the district by four points in 2012.[34] In September 2014, she was endorsed for reelection by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, becoming one of five Democrats to be endorsed by the Chamber in the 2014 congressional election cycle.[82] She was reelected with approximately 55 percent of the vote, beating Rogers by 13 points.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona § District 9\n\nUnopposed in her primary, Sinema won the general election with 61 percent of the vote. Her opponent, Republican nominee Dave Giles, received 39 percent.[84]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nFollowing her election to Congress, Sinema shifted toward the political center, joining the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and amassing a \"reliably moderate-Democratic\" voting record. Sinema worked for the adoption of the DREAM Act,[85] hiring DREAM Act advocate Erika Andiola as a district outreach staffer.[86]\n\n\nOn the House Financial Services Committee, Sinema supported the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act of 2013, which sought to exempt certain financial instruments from some Dodd-Frank restrictions. Bank lobbyists drafted key amendments, which appeared word-for-word in the bill she supported in the committee and on the House floor. It passed the House, with only 119 Democrats and three Republicans opposing it, but failed to advance in the Senate banking committee.[87][88][89]\n\n\nSinema co-sponsored other anti-regulation bills, including the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2015, which includes provisions that Silicon Valley Bank President Gregory W. Becker called for in testimony before Congress that year. That measure also failed to pass.[88]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Financial Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions[90]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations[90]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* New Democrat Coalition[91]\n* Congressional Arts Caucus[92]\n* Veterinary Medicine Caucus[93]\n* Blue Dog Coalition[94]\n* Problem Solvers Caucus[34]\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Arizona\n\n![](image)Sinema at a U.S. Senate campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona, in October 2018\nOn September 28, 2017, Sinema officially announced her candidacy for the Class I United States Senate seat held by Republican incumbent Jeff Flake, who declined to seek reelection the next month.\n\n\nIn March 2018, Sinema donated to charity $33,800 in campaign contributions she had received from Ed Buck, a prominent Democratic donor who came under scrutiny after a homeless escort died of a drug overdose at his California home in 2017.[95] She had previously donated to charity $53,400 in campaign contributions from people with ties to Backpage, a website that was seized by the United States Department of Justice after it was accused of knowingly accepting ads for sex with underage girls.[96][97]\n\n\nFederal Election Commission filings released in April 2018 showed Sinema had raised over $8.2 million, more than the three leading Republican primary contenders combined.[98]\n\n\nDuring the 2018 campaign, Sinema refused to debate her competitor in the Democratic primary, Deedra Abboud, an attorney and community activist.[99] Sinema won the August Democratic primary for the Senate seat. Her Republican opponent in the general election was fellow Arizona U.S. Representative and eventual Senate colleague Martha McSally.[100][101] Sinema received the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign.[102]\n\n\nWhile Abboud said she would vote against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Sinema \"said she wanted to delve deeper into Kavanaugh's writings and interview him personally before deciding\". She said she was \"running on the issues people care about most, including offering quality, affordable health care and promoting economic opportunity\".[103]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Sinema said she would vote against Chuck Schumer for Minority Leader if elected to the U.S. Senate. \"The Democratic leadership has failed Democrats across the country,\" she said. \"I am unafraid to say what I believe about what I think our party needs to do and I think our party needs to grow and change.\"[104]\n\n\nJournalist Jonathan Martin wrote in *The New York Times* in September 2018 that Sinema was running \"one of the most moderate-sounding and cautious Senate campaigns this year, keeping the media at arms-length and avoiding controversial issues\", and said her campaign was generally reluctant to bring up President Donald Trump.[22] According to Martin, both Republicans and Democrats said that Sinema had \"few major legislative accomplishments to her record\" and was running \"on a political image that she has shaped and reshaped over the years. And nothing is more central to it now than her childhood homelessness.\"[22]\n\n\nOn November 12, many news sources called the U.S. Senate race for Sinema, and the Republican nominee, Martha McSally, conceded.[105][106][107][108] Sinema was sworn in with the 116th United States Congress on January 3, 2019.[109][110]\n\n\nSinema is the first woman to represent Arizona in the United States Senate. She is also the first Democrat elected to represent Arizona in the chamber since Dennis DeConcini, who held her current seat from 1977 to 1995.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nSinema was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Senate on January 3, 2019.[113] During the oath of office ceremony, led by Vice President Mike Pence, she decided to be sworn in not on the traditional Bible, but on copies of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Arizona.[114] She is the senior U.S. senator from Arizona; the junior U.S. senator for Arizona is Democrat Mark Kelly. Kelly defeated Sinema's 2018 general election opponent, Martha McSally, who was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated upon the resignation of Jon Kyl, who had been appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated upon the death of John McCain.[113]\n\n\nOn February 14, 2019, Sinema voted to confirm William Barr as attorney general.[115]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinema was noted for her use of colorful wigs. Her spokeswoman explained that Sinema wore them to emphasize the importance of social distancing: by wearing wigs, she did not need to go to a hair salon.[116]\n\n\nSinema voted to convict Donald Trump in both his first and second impeachment trials.[117][118]\n\n\nSinema urged Senate colleagues to vote in favor of the proposed January 6 commission to further investigate the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. In a joint statement with Senator Joe Manchin, she said, \"we implore our Senate Republican colleagues to work with us to find a path forward on a commission to examine the events of January 6th.\"[119] Sinema was one of two Senate Democrats who did not vote on it, the other being Senator Patty Murray of Washington. Murray and Sinema both cited a \"personal family matter\" for their absence.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn October 2021, five of the veterans Sinema had selected for her advisory council as liaisons to the Arizona service member community resigned. Their resignation letter accused her of \"answering to big donors rather than your own people\" and criticized her opposition to key Democratic Party issues, such as abolishing the filibuster and aspects of Biden's Build Back Better Plan.[123][124]\n\n\nSinema was the only U.S. elected official to attend the 2022 Bilderberg Conference, an annual private gathering of the European and North American political and business elite.[125] About 120 high-level politicians, CEOs, national security experts, academics and journalists from 21 countries attended the closed-door meeting.[126][127]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2022, the Arizona Democratic Party executive board voted to censure Sinema for voting with Senate Republicans to maintain the filibuster, preventing passage of a voting rights bill.[128]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Sinema announced that she had left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent.[2] She continued to caucus with the Democratic Party for committee assignments.[129][130][131][132]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n**Source:**[133]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations, and Innovation (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Space and Science\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade and Export Promotion\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight\n\t+ Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management (Chair)\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n* Special Committee on Aging (116th Congress)\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (116th-118th Congress)\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nSinema has been described as a moderate to conservative Democrat, being generally socially liberal but fiscally moderate-to-conservative.[134][135][136] She has cited U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, as a role model.[22]\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Sinema was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the Problem Solvers Caucus.[94] According to the Bipartisan Index created by the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy, Sinema was the sixth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the first session of the 115th United States Congress.[137] The *National Journal*'s 2013 vote ratings placed Sinema near the center of their liberal–conservative scale.[138] In 2015, she voted with the majority of her party 73% of the time.[139] In 2015 and 2016, Sinema did not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the U.S. House.[140] In 2016, the *National Journal* gave her a composite ideology score of 57% liberal and 43% conservative.[141] She was one of the most conservative House Democrats during her House tenure.[7]\n\n\nAccording to *GovTrack*, Sinema has a centrist to center-right voting record in the Senate, to the right of Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.[142] According to *FiveThirtyEight*, as of January 2021, Sinema had voted in line with Donald Trump's position on legislation about 50% of the time.[143] As a result, the Arizona Democratic Party suggested censuring her. But after delaying the vote[144] and watering down the resolution from a censure to an advisement,[145] the Party ultimately tabled the resolution.[146]\n\n\nAccording to *FiveThirtyEight*, as of July 2022, Sinema had voted with President Biden's position on legislative issues 100% of the time.[147]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Sinema changed her party registration to Independent.[148]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nWhen asked about *Roe v. Wade* in 2018, Sinema said the ruling should not be overturned and that she supports a woman's right to have an abortion.[149] In 2020, she had a 100% rating from the abortion-rights organization Planned Parenthood, and a 0% rating from the anti-abortion organization Campaign for Working Families.[141] She was endorsed by EMILY's List, an abortion-rights-focused political action committee,[150] until 2022, when she voted with Republicans against changing the filibuster to allow passage of the Freedom to Vote and John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.[151] That vote also cost her the support of the abortion-rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America.[151] After *Roe v. Wade* was overturned in June 2022, Sinema said the decision \"endangers the health and well-being of women in Arizona and across America.\"[152]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nWhile working as a spokesperson for the Arizona Green Party, Sinema worked to repeal the death penalty.[22] In her 2009 book, *Unite and Conquer*, she explained her stance on capital punishment, writing that she opposed it \"because I think no civilized society should use it as a punishment\", though \"since we have the death penalty in Arizona, I want to ensure that it's being implemented as fairly and judiciously as possible\".[153][154]\n\n\nAccording to *The Arizona Republic*, while serving in the Arizona State Legislature, she introduced more bills regarding the death penalty than bills regarding military or veterans' families.[155] In 2007, she introduced HB 2278, which would require the Arizona Supreme Court to \"strike\" any prior death sentence and \"enter in its place a sentence of natural life\", as in life without parole.[156]\n\n\nSinema has served as an Advisory Board Member of the Arizona Death Penalty Forum.[157] She was also a presenter at their 2010 Spring Conference, which was co-sponsored by Amnesty International and the ACLU of Arizona.[158]\n\n\nIn 2017, Sinema and 47 other House Democrats voted with the majority of House Republicans on H.R. 115, Thin Blue Line Act of 2017,[159] which was opposed by the ACLU.[160] The bill would \"expand the list of statutory aggravating factors in death penalty determinations\" to include the killing or targeting of a law enforcement officer, first responder, or firefighter.[161]\n\n\n\n### Defense[edit]\n\n\nOn February 5, 2019, Sinema voted for a bill that would make improvements to certain defense and security assistance provisions, authorize the appropriation of funds to Israel, and reauthorize the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015.[162] On March 13, 2019, she voted to remove the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.[163]\n\n\n\n### Economics and taxes[edit]\n\n\nSinema has voted for federal stimulus spending.[150] She has said: \"Raising taxes is more economically sound than cutting vital social services.\"[164]\n\n\nIn 2015, Sinema was one of just seven House Democrats to vote in favor of a Republican-backed bill to repeal the estate tax, which affects about 0.2% of Americans in the U.S. each year (estates of $5.43 million or more for individuals, or $10.86 million or more for couples).[165] That same year, she voted to change the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's leadership from a single director to a bipartisan commission.[166][167]\n\n\nIn 2016, with Republican congressman John Katko of New York, Sinema cosponsored the Working Parents Flexibility Act (H.R. 4699). This legislation would establish a tax-free \"parental savings account\" in which employers and parents could invest savings tax-free, with unused funds eligible to be \"rolled into qualifying retirement, college savings or ABLE accounts for people with disabilities without tax penalties\".[168] In September 2018, she voted \"to make individual tax cuts passed by the GOP [in 2017] permanent\".[169] She was one of three Democrats to break with her party and vote for the tax cuts being made permanent.[170]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2019, Sinema and Senator Bill Cassidy released a proposal under which new parents would be authorized to advance their child tax credit benefits in order to receive a $5,000 cash benefit upon either birth or adoption of a child. The parents' child tax credit would then be reduced by $500 for each year of the following decade.[171]\n\n\nIn 2022, several provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 were changed after negotiations with Sinema: a provision narrowing the carried interest loophole was dropped, a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks was added, and manufacturing exceptions were added to the corporate minimum tax.[172][173][174]\n\n\n\n### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2021, Sinema became the second Democratic senator after Joe Manchin to announce her opposition to including a $15/hour minimum wage as part of a COVID-19 relief bill.[175] On March 5, 2021, Sinema voted against an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[176][177] She did so by flashing a thumbs-down,[178] and some commentators compared her demeanor to that of former Arizona senator John McCain, who had voted with a dramatic thumbs-down gesture in 2017;[179] others compared her to former French queen Marie Antoinette, to whom the phrase \"let them eat cake\" is attributed.[176][180][181][182] Sinema's office responded that any commentary on her clothes and demeanor was sexist.[183] Her vote was at odds with that of fellow Democrat Mark Kelly, the junior Arizona senator, who supports a $15/hour minimum wage.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Sinema was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Employer Participation in Repayment Act, enabling employers to contribute up to $5,250 to their employees' student loans.[186]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Sinema was one of four Democratic-caucusing senators to join all Republicans in voting against the Green New Deal, a stimulus program that aims to address climate change and economic inequality, while most other Democrats voted \"present\".[187][188] In April 2019, Sinema was one of three Democrats who voted with Republicans to confirm David Bernhardt, a former oil executive, as Secretary of the Interior Department.[189]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Sinema voted along with the whole Senate for the Natural Resources Management Act, which provides for the management of the natural resources of the United States.[190]\n\n\nIn 2022, Sinema voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major piece of climate and energy legislation designed to invest in renewable energy, which includes billions of dollars for drought relief.[191]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nSinema supports the use of military force to stop genocide, such as in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda.[192] She wrote a doctoral dissertation on the 1994 Rwandan genocide that Lexington Books published in 2015 under the title *Who Must Die in Rwanda's Genocide?: The State of Exception Realized*.[193][194]\n\n\nSinema was opposed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and helped organize anti-war protests while a law student at Arizona State University.[195] Sinema was involved in organizing a Phoenix-area group called the Arizona Alliance for Peaceful Justice (AAPJ). According to Josh Lederman of *The Hill*, \"The group's mission statement at the time called military action 'an inappropriate response to terrorism' and advocated for using the legal system—not violence—to bring Osama bin Laden and others to justice.\"[196]\n\n\nAs an antiwar activist in the years after 9/11, Sinema \"led a group that distributed flyers depicting an American soldier as a skeleton inflicting 'U.S. terror' in Iraq and the Middle East.\" The flyers \"promoted a February 2003 rally organized by Local to Global Justice, an anti-war group Sinema co-founded\". Sinema was described in news reports as an organizer and sponsor of the rally and was listed as the point of contact for the event. One flyer referred to \"Bush and his fascist, imperialist war\", saying, \"Government is slavery\", and describing laws as \"cobwebs for the rich and chains of steel for the poor\". CNN said that such positions were \"a contrast from the more moderate profile she has developed since her 2012 election to Congress\".[197]\n\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, she co-hosted an Air America radio show with 9/11 truther Jeff Farias.[195] In 2006, Sinema said she opposed \"war in all its forms\", and wrote: \"As one of the core organizers against the war from day one (September 12, 2001), I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms.\"[196][192]\n\n\nAfter joining Congress in 2012, she said her views on military force had \"evolved\", and that \"you should never take military intervention off the table. When you do so, you give an out to a rogue nation or rogue actors.\"[192] Lederman reported that \"she said she favors aggressive diplomacy, crippling sanctions to combat proliferation, and swift, multilateral intervention as a last resort\".[192][196] Since joining Congress, she has voted against the Iran Nuclear Deal and supported Trump's missile attack on Syria.[195]\n\n\n\n### Guns[edit]\n\n\nSinema favors gun control measures such as requiring background checks on gun sales between private citizens at gun shows, and requiring a license for gun possession.[198] In 2014 and 2018 the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), which opposes gun regulations, gave Sinema a \"D\" rating.[199][200][141] Gun Owners of America gave her a 17% rating.[201]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains too many or overly lengthy quotations**. Please help summarize the quotations. Consider transferring direct quotations to Wikiquote or excerpts to Wikisource. *(November 2021)*\n |\n\n\nSinema voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act,[202] but has called for reforms to the law.[203] In a 2012 congressional campaign debate, she said the health care law was not perfect, and that in Congress she would work to amend it to make it work effectively.[204] Sinema voted to delay the imposition of fines on those who did not purchase insurance in 2014. She also voted to repeal the Medical Device Tax and for the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013.[205][206][207]\n\n\nSpeaking about healthcare policy, Sinema said, \"I used to say that I wanted universal health-care coverage in Arizona, which went over like a ton of bricks. Turns out, Arizonans hear the word 'universal' and think 'socialism'—or 'pinko commie'. But when I say that I want all Arizonans to have access to affordable, quality health care, Arizonans agree wholeheartedly. Same basic idea, different language.\"[208]\n\n\nIn 2021, Sinema opposed prescription drug pricing reform proposals in House and Senate versions of a Democrat-crafted spending bill. On October 8, 2021, *Jacobin* reported:\n\n\n\n\n> Early last month, a corporate front group called Center Forward purchased $600,000 worth of television and radio ads promoting Sinema in Arizona. The ads touted her \"independence\" and characterized her as \"a bipartisan leader\" in the mold of the late senator John McCain. As we reported, Center Forward has been heavily bankrolled by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the powerful Washington drug lobby. Two Center Forward board members lobby for PhRMA, as well as drugmakers Amgen, Bayer, Gilead Sciences, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi. A few days after the ad campaign started, Sinema informed the White House she opposed the party’s drug pricing plan.[209]\n> \n> \n\n\nSinema and Senator Joe Manchin met with President Biden the same day to discuss their concerns with the bills. Observers have noted that Sinema is one of the largest beneficiaries of pharmaceutical political action committee money in Congress, and has been described as a \"Pharma Favorite\".[210][211] KHN reported: \"For the 2019–20 election cycle through March, political action committees run by employees of drug companies and their trade groups gave her $98,500 in campaign funds, Kaiser Health News' Pharma Cash to Congress database shows. That stands out in a Congress in which a third of the members got no pharma cash for the period and half of those who did got $10,000 or less.\"[210] Sinema's haul was \"twice that of Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans in November, and approached that of fellow Democrat Steny Hoyer, the powerful House majority leader from Maryland.\"[212] Senator Bernie Sanders indirectly called her out, saying: \"Take a hard look at those people who are opposed to strong legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and take a look at their campaign-finance reports. See where they get their money, how many of them get their money from the pharmaceutical industry, and the executives there. And I think there will be a direct correlation.\"[212] On October 18, 2021, *Politico* reported:\n\n\n\n\n> Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia raked in cash last quarter from a bevy of corporations, executives and lobbyists working to pare back the Democratic reconciliation package that Sinema and Manchin have also been vocal opponents of, according to their latest campaign finance filings. ... Sinema, who has emerged as the leading Democratic opponent in the Senate to her party’s drug pricing proposal, received more than $27,000 from PACs of pharmaceutical companies, including Astellas, Sunovion, Takeda, Horizon, Eli Lilly, Abbvie, Alexion and Lundbeck ...[213]\n> \n> \n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a profile in *The Advocate*, \"Sinema has her sights set on advancing LGBT rights.\"[214] She has a history of policy advocacy regarding LGBT rights and issues. In 2006, Sinema was among the leading opponents of a proposed amendment to the Arizona state constitution which would have banned same-sex marriages and civil unions.[215] The proposal failed in Arizona, the first time that a state rejected a ban on same-sex marriage, but a second proposed amendment banning only same-sex marriage passed in 2008 with Sinema in opposition again.[216] She supports same-sex marriage, domestic partnership recognition, and adding gender identity to anti-discrimination laws.[217]\n\n\nIn 2013, Sinema co-sponsored Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney's letter, which opposed Saudi Arabia for \"the use of torture and capital punishment against the LGBTQ community\".[218]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Sinema was a lead cosponsor and negotiator on the Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate, 61–36.[219][220]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n![A woman in her thirties with fairly short blond hair, wearing sunglasses and a beige and pink top, is surrounded by a crowd.](image)Sinema, then a State Representative, attending a protest at the Arizona State Capitol on the day of the SB 1070's signing\nSinema co-sponsored the Southwest Border Security Threat Assessment Act (H.R. 4482), a bill that calls for border threat analysis of terrorism, smuggling, and human trafficking every five years.[221][222]\n\n\nSinema was one of 24 House Democrats to vote in favor of Kate's Law,[223] a bill that would expand maximum sentences for foreigners who attempt to reenter the country, legally or illegally, after having been deported, denied entry or removed, and for foreign felons who attempt to reenter the country.[224]\n\n\nSinema voted for the SAFE Act, which expanded the refugee screening process to require signatures from the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Director of National Intelligence for each refugee entering the country.[225][226]\n\n\nSinema opposed Arizona SB 1070. She has argued that mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is not an option and supported the DREAM Act. Her 2012 campaign website stated that \"we need to create a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented workers that requires them to get right with the law by paying back taxes, paying a fine and learning English as a condition of gaining citizenship.\"[221] In July 2018, she broke with her party by voting with Republicans against abolishing ICE.[227]\n\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform, a PAC that seeks to limit both legal and illegal immigration, gave Sinema a 33% rating in 2018, and UnidosUS, which supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, gave Sinema a score of 88% in 2014.[201]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2019, Sinema voted against Trump's National Emergency declaration on border security.[228]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2021, Sinema voted against providing COVID-19 pandemic financial support to undocumented immigrants.[229]\n\n\n\n### Privacy[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Sinema became one of 29 original cosponsors of the bipartisan LIBERT-E (Limiting Internet and Blanket Electronic Review of Telecommunications and Email) Act, along with Representative Justin Amash. The legislation would limit the National Security Agency (NSA) to only collecting electronic information from subjects of an investigation.[230]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Sinema joined a bipartisan majority and voted against an amendment to a defense appropriations bill (offered by Amash) to prohibit the NSA from monitoring and recording details of U.S. citizens' telecommunications without a warrant.[231]\n\n\n\n### Senate filibuster[edit]\n\n\nEarly in her career, Sinema expressed enthusiasm about evading the Senate filibuster through the reconciliation process.[232]\n\n\nOn January 25, 2021, a spokesperson for Sinema told *The Washington Post* that she is \"against eliminating the filibuster\" and \"not open to changing her mind\" on the issue.[233][234] Additionally, Sinema has spoken out on the elimination of the judicial filibuster as a key reason for increased politicization of the judiciary.[235]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Sinema and Democratic Senate colleague Joe Manchin voted against changing the Senate filibuster rule. The proposed rule change, which would have allowed certain voting rights bills to advance to the Senate floor without meeting the Senate's 60-vote threshold, was voted down by a 52-48 margin.[236] Days later, the Arizona Democratic Party executive committee censured Sinema for voting to retain the filibuster rule.[237]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Sinema was one of five House Democrats to vote for a Republican-backed bill barring the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from regulating broadband rates. Her vote broke from her party; other Democrats were strongly opposed to the measure, and President Obama said he would veto it if it passed.[238]\n\n\nIn 2019, Sinema was the sole Senate Democrat not to co-sponsor the Save the Internet Act, which would restore Obama-era regulations preventing ISPs from throttling consumers' website traffic. She worked with Senate Republican Roger Wicker to develop their own net neutrality bill.[239]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinema married, and later divorced, her BYU classmate Blake Dain.[240][24] She is bisexual.[241] She has been reported to be the only atheist member of Congress,[242][243] although she has rejected the label.[73]\n\n\n\n### Amateur athlete[edit]\n\n\nSinema has completed numerous marathons. In 2019, she completed a marathon in 3:28:17, which was fast enough for her (female) age group to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Two weeks before her Boston-qualifying race, she ran a three-mile race in 20:42, setting a record for women in Congress.[244] In 2020, she set a personal record of 3:21:45 and later in 2021, she broke her right foot while running a marathon, requiring her to use a hands-free crutch.[245]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2013, Sinema completed an Ironman Triathlon in a little over 15 hours. She was the second active member of Congress, after Senator Jeff Merkley, to finish a long-distance triathlon, and the first to complete an Ironman-branded race.[246] She completed the 2015 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii.[28]\n\n\nOn December 25, 2013, Sinema climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.[247]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Kyrsten Sinema\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Sinema, Kyrsten (2009). *Unite and Conquer: How to Build Coalitions That Win and Last*.

A former member of the Democratic Party, Sinema became an independent in December 2022.[2][3][4][5][6]\n\n\nSinema served three terms as a state representative for the 15th legislative district from 2005 to 2011, one term as the state senator for the 15th legislative district from 2011 to 2012, and three terms as the United States representative for the 9th district from 2013 to 2019. She began her political career in the Arizona Green Party and rose to prominence for her progressive advocacy, supporting causes such as LGBT rights and opposing the war on terror. She left the Green Party to join the Arizona Democratic Party in 2004 and was elected to a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 2012. After her election, she joined the New Democrat Coalition, the Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, amassing one of the most conservative voting records in the Democratic caucus.[7] Sinema won the 2018 Senate election to replace the retiring Jeff Flake, defeating Republican nominee Martha McSally. She is the first bisexual and the second LGBT woman (after Tammy Baldwin) to be elected to Congress, in the House of Representatives in 2012 and in the Senate in 2018.[8] She is also the first woman elected to the Senate from Arizona[9] and the only religiously unaffiliated member of Congress.[10]\n\n\nSinema is considered a key swing vote in the Senate,[11][12][13][14] which was split 50–50 between Democrats and Republicans in the 117th U.S. Congress. She is one of three independents in the Senate, the others being Bernie Sanders and Angus King, both of whom also caucus with the Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nSinema was born in Tucson, Arizona, on July 12, 1976,[15] to Marilyn (Wiley) and Dan Sinema.[16][17] Sinema has an older brother and younger sister.[18][19] Her father was an attorney. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and her mother, who had custody of the children, remarried. With her siblings, mother, and stepfather, Sinema moved to DeFuniak Springs, Florida, a small town in the Panhandle.[19]\n\n\nWhen her stepfather lost his job and the bank foreclosed on their home, the family lived for three years in an abandoned gas station.[20] Sinema has said that for two years they had no toilet or electricity while living there.[21] She later recalled, \"My stepdad built a bunkbed for me and my sister. We separated our bunkbed from the kitchen with one of those big chalkboards on rollers. I knew that was weird. A chalkboard shouldn't be a wall. A kitchen should have running water.\"[21]\n\n\nAccording to journalist Jonathan Martin in *The New York Times*, Sinema has given \"contradictory answers about her early life\", and her mother and stepfather have filed court documents saying they had made monthly payments for gas, electricity, and phone bills, even though Sinema had said they had been \"without running water or electricity\".[22] Asked whether she had embellished details from her childhood, Sinema said, \"I've shared what I remember from my childhood. I know what I lived through.\"[22]\n\n\nSinema was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).[23] She graduated as valedictorian from Walton High School in DeFuniak Springs at age 16 and earned her B.A. from Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1995 at age 18.[24][20] She left the LDS Church after graduating from BYU.[23] Sinema returned to Arizona in 1995.[25]\n\n\nWhile employed as a social worker, Sinema completed a Master of Social Work degree at Arizona State University in 1999. In 2004, she earned a J.D. degree from Arizona State University College of Law and started working as a criminal defense lawyer.[20][26] In 2012, she earned a Ph.D. in justice studies from Arizona State[20][27] and in 2018, she completed an online M.B.A. from the W. P. Carey School of Business.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Sinema became an adjunct professor teaching master's-level policy and grant-writing classes at Arizona State University School of Social Work and an adjunct business law professor at Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as Phoenix School of Law.[30] Sinema began her political career in the Arizona Green Party before joining the Arizona Democratic Party in 2004,[31] and called herself a \"Prada socialist\".[32][33]\n\n\nIn 2000, Sinema worked on Ralph Nader's presidential campaign.[34] In 2001 and 2002, she ran for local elected offices as an independent and lost.[25] In 2002, *The Arizona Republic* published a letter from Sinema criticizing capitalism. She wrote: \"Until the average American realizes that capitalism damages her livelihood while augmenting the livelihoods of the wealthy, the Almighty Dollar will continue to rule.\"[35] In 2003, she protested Joe Lieberman's unsuccessful 2004 presidential bid, telling the *Hartford Courant*: \"He's a shame to Democrats. I don't even know why he's running. He seems to want to get Republicans voting for him – what kind of strategy is that?\"[36][37]\n\n\nWhile in the Green Party, Sinema was its local spokesperson, working to repeal the death penalty and organizing antiwar protests.[38] She had organized 15 antiwar rallies by the time the Iraq War began.[25] She also opposed the war in Afghanistan.[25] During a February 15, 2003, protest in Patriots Square Park in Phoenix, a group led by Sinema distributed flyers portraying a U.S. service member as a skeleton \"inflicting 'U.S. terror' in Iraq and the Middle East\".[25]\n\n\nIn a 2003 opinion piece, Sinema wrote that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were \"the real Saddam and Osama lovers\".[39] When asked on a local radio show whether she would oppose someone joining the Taliban and fighting on its behalf, Sinema responded: \"Fine ... I don't care if you want to do that, go ahead.\"[25]\n\n\nIn a 2011 address to Netroots Nation, Sinema called Arizona the \"meth lab of democracy\".[40]\n\n\n\n## Arizona State Legislature[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![Sinema walking up stairs and smiling to the camera](image)Sinema in 2009\nIn 2002, Sinema first ran for the Arizona House of Representatives as an independent affiliated with the Arizona Green Party.[41] She finished in last place in a five-candidate field, receiving 8 percent of the vote.[42]\n\n\nSinema joined the Democratic Party in 2004.[31] That year, Sinema and David Lujan won the two seats for Arizona's 15th district, with 37 percent of the vote for Sinema and 34 percent for Lujan over incumbent representative Wally Straughn.[43] Sinema was subsequently reelected three times with over 30 percent of the vote.[44][45][46] In 2008, Sinema completed the Harvard University John F. Kennedy School of Government program for senior executives in state and local government as a David Bohnett LGBTQ Victory Institute Leadership Fellow. In 2009 and 2010, Sinema was an assistant Minority Leader for the Democratic Caucus of the Arizona House of Representatives.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sinema in 2010\nIn 2010, Sinema was elected to the Arizona Senate, defeating Republican Bob Thomas, 63 to 37 percent.[48]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Elle*, \"her first public comment as an elected official came in 2005, after a Republican colleague's speech insulted LGBT people. 'We're simply people like everyone else who want and deserve respect', she passionately declared. Later, when reporters asked about her use of the first person, Sinema replied, 'Duh, I'm bisexual.'\"[19] In 2012, when running for U.S. House, Sinema said she did not remember disclosing her sexual orientation in 2005 and declined to discuss the significance of being the first openly bisexual member of the House.[49]\n\n\nIn 2006, Sinema told a radio host that she was \"the most liberal member of the Arizona State Legislature\".[50] Also in 2006, she sponsored a bill urging the adoption of the DREAM Act,[51] and co-chaired Arizona Together, the statewide campaign that defeated Proposition 107, which would have banned the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona. In 2008, a similar referendum, Proposition 102, passed.[52]\n\n\nIn 2006, Sinema was asked about \"new feminism\", and responded: \"These women who act like staying at home, leeching off their husbands or boyfriends, and just cashing the checks is some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life. That's bullshit. I mean, what the fuck are we really talking about here?\"[53][54][55] After facing criticism, Sinema apologized and said the interview format was intended to be a \"lighthearted spoof\", adding: \"I was raised by a stay-at-home mom. So she did a pretty good job with me.\"[56]\n\n\nSinema campaigned against Proposition 107, a referendum to ban the recognition of same-sex marriage and civil unions in Arizona.[57] In 2008, she led the campaign against Proposition 102, another referendum that would have banned the recognition of same-sex marriage in Arizona. Proposition 102 was approved with 56% of the vote in the general election on November 4, 2008. Sinema chaired a coalition called Protect Arizona's Freedom, which defeated Ward Connerly's goal to place an initiative on the state ballot that would eliminate racial-preference programs.[58][59]\n\n\nIn June 2009, Sinema was one of 32 state legislators appointed by President Barack Obama to the White House Health Reform Task Force, which helped shape the Affordable Care Act.[60] \"Thanks in part to her hard work in improving the bill\", she was invited to attend the Obamacare bill signing at the White House in March 2010.[61]\n\n\nIn 2010, Sinema sponsored a bill to give in-state tuition to veterans; it was held in committee and did not receive a vote.[62] Also in 2010, Sinema was named one of *Time* magazine's \"40 Under 40\".[63] The Center for Inquiry gave Sinema its Award for the Advancement of Science and Reason in Public Policy in 2011.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinema's official portrait as U.S. Representative in 2013\nMain article: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona § District 9\n\nIn June 2011, Sinema said she was considering running for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012. She lived in the same Phoenix neighborhood as incumbent Democratic congressman Ed Pastor, but was adamant that she would not challenge another Democrat in a primary.[65] On January 3, 2012, Sinema announced her bid for Congress, in the 9th congressional district.[66] The district had previously been the 5th, represented by freshman Republican David Schweikert; it contained 60 percent of the old 5th's territory.[67] Schweikert had been drawn into the 6th district—the old 3rd district—and sought reelection there.\n\n\nAlthough Sinema was not required to resign her State Senate seat under Arizona's resign-to-run laws (since she was in the final year of her term), she did so on the same day that she announced her candidacy. On August 28, 2012, Sinema won the three-way Democratic primary with nearly 42 percent of the vote. Her opponents, state Senator David Schapira and former Arizona Democratic Party chairman Andrei Cherny, a former speechwriter in the Clinton administration, each finished with less than 30 percent of the vote.[20][68][69]\n\n\nIn the general election, Sinema ran against Republican nominee Vernon Parker, the former mayor of Paradise Valley.[20] She was endorsed by *The Arizona Republic*.[20] The campaign was described as a \"nasty\",[70] \"bitterly fought race that featured millions of dollars in attack ads\".[71] Parker ran campaign ads that accused Sinema of being an \"anti-American hippie\" who practiced \"Pagan rituals\".[72] The Republican-aligned outside group American Future Fund spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on attack ads against Sinema.[54] When her religious views were raised as an issue, her campaign said that she simply believes in a secular approach to government.[73]\n\n\nThe November 6 election was initially too close to call, because Arizona election authorities failed to count more than 25 percent of the votes on election day.[74] Sinema held a narrow lead over Parker, while provisional and absentee ballots were still being counted.[75][76] On November 12, when it was apparent that Sinema's lead was too large for Parker to overcome, the Associated Press called the race for Sinema.[77]\n\n\nOnce all ballots were counted, Sinema won by 4 percentage points, over 10,000 votes. Libertarian Powell Gammill finished third with 7 percent of the votes.[78]\n\n\nSinema is the first openly bisexual person and second openly LGBT woman (after Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin) elected to the United States Congress.[79]\n\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona § District 9\n\nSinema ran for reelection in 2014 and was unopposed in the Democratic primary, which took place on August 26, 2014. She faced Republican Wendy Rogers in the general election.[80][81]\n\n\nAccording to *Roll Call*, Sinema considered herself bipartisan. It was drawn as a \"fair-fight\" district, and President Barack Obama won the district by four points in 2012.[34] In September 2014, she was endorsed for reelection by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, becoming one of five Democrats to be endorsed by the Chamber in the 2014 congressional election cycle.[82] She was reelected with approximately 55 percent of the vote, beating Rogers by 13 points.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona § District 9\n\nUnopposed in her primary, Sinema won the general election with 61 percent of the vote. Her opponent, Republican nominee Dave Giles, received 39 percent.[84]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nFollowing her election to Congress, Sinema shifted toward the political center, joining the conservative Democratic Blue Dog Coalition and the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and amassing a \"reliably moderate-Democratic\" voting record. Sinema worked for the adoption of the DREAM Act,[85] hiring DREAM Act advocate Erika Andiola as a district outreach staffer.[86]\n\n\nOn the House Financial Services Committee, Sinema supported the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act of 2013, which sought to exempt certain financial instruments from some Dodd-Frank restrictions. Bank lobbyists drafted key amendments, which appeared word-for-word in the bill she supported in the committee and on the House floor. It passed the House, with only 119 Democrats and three Republicans opposing it, but failed to advance in the Senate banking committee.[87][88][89]\n\n\nSinema co-sponsored other anti-regulation bills, including the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2015, which includes provisions that Silicon Valley Bank President Gregory W. Becker called for in testimony before Congress that year. That measure also failed to pass.[88]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Financial Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions[90]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations[90]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* New Democrat Coalition[91]\n* Congressional Arts Caucus[92]\n* Veterinary Medicine Caucus[93]\n* Blue Dog Coalition[94]\n* Problem Solvers Caucus[34]\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Arizona\n\n![](image)Sinema at a U.S. Senate campaign event in Phoenix, Arizona, in October 2018\nOn September 28, 2017, Sinema officially announced her candidacy for the Class I United States Senate seat held by Republican incumbent Jeff Flake, who declined to seek reelection the next month.\n\n\nIn March 2018, Sinema donated to charity $33,800 in campaign contributions she had received from Ed Buck, a prominent Democratic donor who came under scrutiny after a homeless escort died of a drug overdose at his California home in 2017.[95] She had previously donated to charity $53,400 in campaign contributions from people with ties to Backpage, a website that was seized by the United States Department of Justice after it was accused of knowingly accepting ads for sex with underage girls.[96][97]\n\n\nFederal Election Commission filings released in April 2018 showed Sinema had raised over $8.2 million, more than the three leading Republican primary contenders combined.[98]\n\n\nDuring the 2018 campaign, Sinema refused to debate her competitor in the Democratic primary, Deedra Abboud, an attorney and community activist.[99] Sinema won the August Democratic primary for the Senate seat. Her Republican opponent in the general election was fellow Arizona U.S. Representative and eventual Senate colleague Martha McSally.[100][101] Sinema received the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign.[102]\n\n\nWhile Abboud said she would vote against the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Sinema \"said she wanted to delve deeper into Kavanaugh's writings and interview him personally before deciding\". She said she was \"running on the issues people care about most, including offering quality, affordable health care and promoting economic opportunity\".[103]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Sinema said she would vote against Chuck Schumer for Minority Leader if elected to the U.S. Senate. \"The Democratic leadership has failed Democrats across the country,\" she said. \"I am unafraid to say what I believe about what I think our party needs to do and I think our party needs to grow and change.\"[104]\n\n\nJournalist Jonathan Martin wrote in *The New York Times* in September 2018 that Sinema was running \"one of the most moderate-sounding and cautious Senate campaigns this year, keeping the media at arms-length and avoiding controversial issues\", and said her campaign was generally reluctant to bring up President Donald Trump.[22] According to Martin, both Republicans and Democrats said that Sinema had \"few major legislative accomplishments to her record\" and was running \"on a political image that she has shaped and reshaped over the years. And nothing is more central to it now than her childhood homelessness.\"[22]\n\n\nOn November 12, many news sources called the U.S. Senate race for Sinema, and the Republican nominee, Martha McSally, conceded.[105][106][107][108] Sinema was sworn in with the 116th United States Congress on January 3, 2019.[109][110]\n\n\nSinema is the first woman to represent Arizona in the United States Senate. She is also the first Democrat elected to represent Arizona in the chamber since Dennis DeConcini, who held her current seat from 1977 to 1995.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nSinema was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Senate on January 3, 2019.[113] During the oath of office ceremony, led by Vice President Mike Pence, she decided to be sworn in not on the traditional Bible, but on copies of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of Arizona.[114] She is the senior U.S. senator from Arizona; the junior U.S. senator for Arizona is Democrat Mark Kelly. Kelly defeated Sinema's 2018 general election opponent, Martha McSally, who was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated upon the resignation of Jon Kyl, who had been appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated upon the death of John McCain.[113]\n\n\nOn February 14, 2019, Sinema voted to confirm William Barr as attorney general.[115]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinema was noted for her use of colorful wigs. Her spokeswoman explained that Sinema wore them to emphasize the importance of social distancing: by wearing wigs, she did not need to go to a hair salon.[116]\n\n\nSinema voted to convict Donald Trump in both his first and second impeachment trials.[117][118]\n\n\nSinema urged Senate colleagues to vote in favor of the proposed January 6 commission to further investigate the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. In a joint statement with Senator Joe Manchin, she said, \"we implore our Senate Republican colleagues to work with us to find a path forward on a commission to examine the events of January 6th.\"[119] Sinema was one of two Senate Democrats who did not vote on it, the other being Senator Patty Murray of Washington. Murray and Sinema both cited a \"personal family matter\" for their absence.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn October 2021, five of the veterans Sinema had selected for her advisory council as liaisons to the Arizona service member community resigned. Their resignation letter accused her of \"answering to big donors rather than your own people\" and criticized her opposition to key Democratic Party issues, such as abolishing the filibuster and aspects of Biden's Build Back Better Plan.[123][124]\n\n\nSinema was the only U.S. elected official to attend the 2022 Bilderberg Conference, an annual private gathering of the European and North American political and business elite.[125] About 120 high-level politicians, CEOs, national security experts, academics and journalists from 21 countries attended the closed-door meeting.[126][127]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2022, the Arizona Democratic Party executive board voted to censure Sinema for voting with Senate Republicans to maintain the filibuster, preventing passage of a voting rights bill.[128]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Sinema announced that she had left the Democratic Party and registered as an independent.[2] She continued to caucus with the Democratic Party for committee assignments.[129][130][131][132]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n**Source:**[133]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation Safety, Operations, and Innovation (Chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Space and Science\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade and Export Promotion\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight\n\t+ Subcommittee on Government Operations and Border Management (Chair)\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n* Special Committee on Aging (116th Congress)\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (116th-118th Congress)\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nSinema has been described as a moderate to conservative Democrat, being generally socially liberal but fiscally moderate-to-conservative.[134][135][136] She has cited U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, as a role model.[22]\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Sinema was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the Problem Solvers Caucus.[94] According to the Bipartisan Index created by the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy, Sinema was the sixth most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the first session of the 115th United States Congress.[137] The *National Journal*'s 2013 vote ratings placed Sinema near the center of their liberal–conservative scale.[138] In 2015, she voted with the majority of her party 73% of the time.[139] In 2015 and 2016, Sinema did not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the U.S. House.[140] In 2016, the *National Journal* gave her a composite ideology score of 57% liberal and 43% conservative.[141] She was one of the most conservative House Democrats during her House tenure.[7]\n\n\nAccording to *GovTrack*, Sinema has a centrist to center-right voting record in the Senate, to the right of Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.[142] According to *FiveThirtyEight*, as of January 2021, Sinema had voted in line with Donald Trump's position on legislation about 50% of the time.[143] As a result, the Arizona Democratic Party suggested censuring her. But after delaying the vote[144] and watering down the resolution from a censure to an advisement,[145] the Party ultimately tabled the resolution.[146]\n\n\nAccording to *FiveThirtyEight*, as of July 2022, Sinema had voted with President Biden's position on legislative issues 100% of the time.[147]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Sinema changed her party registration to Independent.[148]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nWhen asked about *Roe v. Wade* in 2018, Sinema said the ruling should not be overturned and that she supports a woman's right to have an abortion.[149] In 2020, she had a 100% rating from the abortion-rights organization Planned Parenthood, and a 0% rating from the anti-abortion organization Campaign for Working Families.[141] She was endorsed by EMILY's List, an abortion-rights-focused political action committee,[150] until 2022, when she voted with Republicans against changing the filibuster to allow passage of the Freedom to Vote and John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act.[151] That vote also cost her the support of the abortion-rights advocacy group NARAL Pro-Choice America.[151] After *Roe v. Wade* was overturned in June 2022, Sinema said the decision \"endangers the health and well-being of women in Arizona and across America.\"[152]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nWhile working as a spokesperson for the Arizona Green Party, Sinema worked to repeal the death penalty.[22] In her 2009 book, *Unite and Conquer*, she explained her stance on capital punishment, writing that she opposed it \"because I think no civilized society should use it as a punishment\", though \"since we have the death penalty in Arizona, I want to ensure that it's being implemented as fairly and judiciously as possible\".[153][154]\n\n\nAccording to *The Arizona Republic*, while serving in the Arizona State Legislature, she introduced more bills regarding the death penalty than bills regarding military or veterans' families.[155] In 2007, she introduced HB 2278, which would require the Arizona Supreme Court to \"strike\" any prior death sentence and \"enter in its place a sentence of natural life\", as in life without parole.[156]\n\n\nSinema has served as an Advisory Board Member of the Arizona Death Penalty Forum.[157] She was also a presenter at their 2010 Spring Conference, which was co-sponsored by Amnesty International and the ACLU of Arizona.[158]\n\n\nIn 2017, Sinema and 47 other House Democrats voted with the majority of House Republicans on H.R. 115, Thin Blue Line Act of 2017,[159] which was opposed by the ACLU.[160] The bill would \"expand the list of statutory aggravating factors in death penalty determinations\" to include the killing or targeting of a law enforcement officer, first responder, or firefighter.[161]\n\n\n\n### Defense[edit]\n\n\nOn February 5, 2019, Sinema voted for a bill that would make improvements to certain defense and security assistance provisions, authorize the appropriation of funds to Israel, and reauthorize the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015.[162] On March 13, 2019, she voted to remove the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.[163]\n\n\n\n### Economics and taxes[edit]\n\n\nSinema has voted for federal stimulus spending.[150] She has said: \"Raising taxes is more economically sound than cutting vital social services.\"[164]\n\n\nIn 2015, Sinema was one of just seven House Democrats to vote in favor of a Republican-backed bill to repeal the estate tax, which affects about 0.2% of Americans in the U.S. each year (estates of $5.43 million or more for individuals, or $10.86 million or more for couples).[165] That same year, she voted to change the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's leadership from a single director to a bipartisan commission.[166][167]\n\n\nIn 2016, with Republican congressman John Katko of New York, Sinema cosponsored the Working Parents Flexibility Act (H.R. 4699). This legislation would establish a tax-free \"parental savings account\" in which employers and parents could invest savings tax-free, with unused funds eligible to be \"rolled into qualifying retirement, college savings or ABLE accounts for people with disabilities without tax penalties\".[168] In September 2018, she voted \"to make individual tax cuts passed by the GOP [in 2017] permanent\".[169] She was one of three Democrats to break with her party and vote for the tax cuts being made permanent.[170]\n\n\nOn July 30, 2019, Sinema and Senator Bill Cassidy released a proposal under which new parents would be authorized to advance their child tax credit benefits in order to receive a $5,000 cash benefit upon either birth or adoption of a child. The parents' child tax credit would then be reduced by $500 for each year of the following decade.[171]\n\n\nIn 2022, several provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 were changed after negotiations with Sinema: a provision narrowing the carried interest loophole was dropped, a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks was added, and manufacturing exceptions were added to the corporate minimum tax.[172][173][174]\n\n\n\n### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2021, Sinema became the second Democratic senator after Joe Manchin to announce her opposition to including a $15/hour minimum wage as part of a COVID-19 relief bill.[175] On March 5, 2021, Sinema voted against an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders as part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[176][177] She did so by flashing a thumbs-down,[178] and some commentators compared her demeanor to that of former Arizona senator John McCain, who had voted with a dramatic thumbs-down gesture in 2017;[179] others compared her to former French queen Marie Antoinette, to whom the phrase \"let them eat cake\" is attributed.[176][180][181][182] Sinema's office responded that any commentary on her clothes and demeanor was sexist.[183] Her vote was at odds with that of fellow Democrat Mark Kelly, the junior Arizona senator, who supports a $15/hour minimum wage.[184][185]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Sinema was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Employer Participation in Repayment Act, enabling employers to contribute up to $5,250 to their employees' student loans.[186]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Sinema was one of four Democratic-caucusing senators to join all Republicans in voting against the Green New Deal, a stimulus program that aims to address climate change and economic inequality, while most other Democrats voted \"present\".[187][188] In April 2019, Sinema was one of three Democrats who voted with Republicans to confirm David Bernhardt, a former oil executive, as Secretary of the Interior Department.[189]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2019, Sinema voted along with the whole Senate for the Natural Resources Management Act, which provides for the management of the natural resources of the United States.[190]\n\n\nIn 2022, Sinema voted for the Inflation Reduction Act, a major piece of climate and energy legislation designed to invest in renewable energy, which includes billions of dollars for drought relief.[191]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nSinema supports the use of military force to stop genocide, such as in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda.[192] She wrote a doctoral dissertation on the 1994 Rwandan genocide that Lexington Books published in 2015 under the title *Who Must Die in Rwanda's Genocide?: The State of Exception Realized*.[193][194]\n\n\nSinema was opposed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and helped organize anti-war protests while a law student at Arizona State University.[195] Sinema was involved in organizing a Phoenix-area group called the Arizona Alliance for Peaceful Justice (AAPJ). According to Josh Lederman of *The Hill*, \"The group's mission statement at the time called military action 'an inappropriate response to terrorism' and advocated for using the legal system—not violence—to bring Osama bin Laden and others to justice.\"[196]\n\n\nAs an antiwar activist in the years after 9/11, Sinema \"led a group that distributed flyers depicting an American soldier as a skeleton inflicting 'U.S. terror' in Iraq and the Middle East.\" The flyers \"promoted a February 2003 rally organized by Local to Global Justice, an anti-war group Sinema co-founded\". Sinema was described in news reports as an organizer and sponsor of the rally and was listed as the point of contact for the event. One flyer referred to \"Bush and his fascist, imperialist war\", saying, \"Government is slavery\", and describing laws as \"cobwebs for the rich and chains of steel for the poor\". CNN said that such positions were \"a contrast from the more moderate profile she has developed since her 2012 election to Congress\".[197]\n\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, she co-hosted an Air America radio show with 9/11 truther Jeff Farias.[195] In 2006, Sinema said she opposed \"war in all its forms\", and wrote: \"As one of the core organizers against the war from day one (September 12, 2001), I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms.\"[196][192]\n\n\nAfter joining Congress in 2012, she said her views on military force had \"evolved\", and that \"you should never take military intervention off the table. When you do so, you give an out to a rogue nation or rogue actors.\"[192] Lederman reported that \"she said she favors aggressive diplomacy, crippling sanctions to combat proliferation, and swift, multilateral intervention as a last resort\".[192][196] Since joining Congress, she has voted against the Iran Nuclear Deal and supported Trump's missile attack on Syria.[195]\n\n\n\n### Guns[edit]\n\n\nSinema favors gun control measures such as requiring background checks on gun sales between private citizens at gun shows, and requiring a license for gun possession.[198] In 2014 and 2018 the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF), which opposes gun regulations, gave Sinema a \"D\" rating.[199][200][141] Gun Owners of America gave her a 17% rating.[201]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains too many or overly lengthy quotations**. Please help summarize the quotations. Consider transferring direct quotations to Wikiquote or excerpts to Wikisource. *(November 2021)*\n |\n\n\nSinema voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act,[202] but has called for reforms to the law.[203] In a 2012 congressional campaign debate, she said the health care law was not perfect, and that in Congress she would work to amend it to make it work effectively.[204] Sinema voted to delay the imposition of fines on those who did not purchase insurance in 2014. She also voted to repeal the Medical Device Tax and for the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013.[205][206][207]\n\n\nSpeaking about healthcare policy, Sinema said, \"I used to say that I wanted universal health-care coverage in Arizona, which went over like a ton of bricks. Turns out, Arizonans hear the word 'universal' and think 'socialism'—or 'pinko commie'. But when I say that I want all Arizonans to have access to affordable, quality health care, Arizonans agree wholeheartedly. Same basic idea, different language.\"[208]\n\n\nIn 2021, Sinema opposed prescription drug pricing reform proposals in House and Senate versions of a Democrat-crafted spending bill. On October 8, 2021, *Jacobin* reported:\n\n\n\n\n> Early last month, a corporate front group called Center Forward purchased $600,000 worth of television and radio ads promoting Sinema in Arizona. The ads touted her \"independence\" and characterized her as \"a bipartisan leader\" in the mold of the late senator John McCain. As we reported, Center Forward has been heavily bankrolled by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the powerful Washington drug lobby. Two Center Forward board members lobby for PhRMA, as well as drugmakers Amgen, Bayer, Gilead Sciences, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi. A few days after the ad campaign started, Sinema informed the White House she opposed the party’s drug pricing plan.[209]\n> \n> \n\n\nSinema and Senator Joe Manchin met with President Biden the same day to discuss their concerns with the bills. Observers have noted that Sinema is one of the largest beneficiaries of pharmaceutical political action committee money in Congress, and has been described as a \"Pharma Favorite\".[210][211] KHN reported: \"For the 2019–20 election cycle through March, political action committees run by employees of drug companies and their trade groups gave her $98,500 in campaign funds, Kaiser Health News' Pharma Cash to Congress database shows. That stands out in a Congress in which a third of the members got no pharma cash for the period and half of those who did got $10,000 or less.\"[210] Sinema's haul was \"twice that of Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans in November, and approached that of fellow Democrat Steny Hoyer, the powerful House majority leader from Maryland.\"[212] Senator Bernie Sanders indirectly called her out, saying: \"Take a hard look at those people who are opposed to strong legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and take a look at their campaign-finance reports. See where they get their money, how many of them get their money from the pharmaceutical industry, and the executives there. And I think there will be a direct correlation.\"[212] On October 18, 2021, *Politico* reported:\n\n\n\n\n> Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia raked in cash last quarter from a bevy of corporations, executives and lobbyists working to pare back the Democratic reconciliation package that Sinema and Manchin have also been vocal opponents of, according to their latest campaign finance filings. ... Sinema, who has emerged as the leading Democratic opponent in the Senate to her party’s drug pricing proposal, received more than $27,000 from PACs of pharmaceutical companies, including Astellas, Sunovion, Takeda, Horizon, Eli Lilly, Abbvie, Alexion and Lundbeck ...[213]\n> \n> \n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a profile in *The Advocate*, \"Sinema has her sights set on advancing LGBT rights.\"[214] She has a history of policy advocacy regarding LGBT rights and issues. In 2006, Sinema was among the leading opponents of a proposed amendment to the Arizona state constitution which would have banned same-sex marriages and civil unions.[215] The proposal failed in Arizona, the first time that a state rejected a ban on same-sex marriage, but a second proposed amendment banning only same-sex marriage passed in 2008 with Sinema in opposition again.[216] She supports same-sex marriage, domestic partnership recognition, and adding gender identity to anti-discrimination laws.[217]\n\n\nIn 2013, Sinema co-sponsored Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney's letter, which opposed Saudi Arabia for \"the use of torture and capital punishment against the LGBTQ community\".[218]\n\n\nIn December 2022, Sinema was a lead cosponsor and negotiator on the Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the Senate, 61–36.[219][220]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n![A woman in her thirties with fairly short blond hair, wearing sunglasses and a beige and pink top, is surrounded by a crowd.](image)Sinema, then a State Representative, attending a protest at the Arizona State Capitol on the day of the SB 1070's signing\nSinema co-sponsored the Southwest Border Security Threat Assessment Act (H.R. 4482), a bill that calls for border threat analysis of terrorism, smuggling, and human trafficking every five years.[221][222]\n\n\nSinema was one of 24 House Democrats to vote in favor of Kate's Law,[223] a bill that would expand maximum sentences for foreigners who attempt to reenter the country, legally or illegally, after having been deported, denied entry or removed, and for foreign felons who attempt to reenter the country.[224]\n\n\nSinema voted for the SAFE Act, which expanded the refugee screening process to require signatures from the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Director of National Intelligence for each refugee entering the country.[225][226]\n\n\nSinema opposed Arizona SB 1070. She has argued that mass deportation of undocumented immigrants is not an option and supported the DREAM Act. Her 2012 campaign website stated that \"we need to create a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented workers that requires them to get right with the law by paying back taxes, paying a fine and learning English as a condition of gaining citizenship.\"[221] In July 2018, she broke with her party by voting with Republicans against abolishing ICE.[227]\n\n\nThe Federation for American Immigration Reform, a PAC that seeks to limit both legal and illegal immigration, gave Sinema a 33% rating in 2018, and UnidosUS, which supports a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, gave Sinema a score of 88% in 2014.[201]\n\n\nOn March 14, 2019, Sinema voted against Trump's National Emergency declaration on border security.[228]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2021, Sinema voted against providing COVID-19 pandemic financial support to undocumented immigrants.[229]\n\n\n\n### Privacy[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Sinema became one of 29 original cosponsors of the bipartisan LIBERT-E (Limiting Internet and Blanket Electronic Review of Telecommunications and Email) Act, along with Representative Justin Amash. The legislation would limit the National Security Agency (NSA) to only collecting electronic information from subjects of an investigation.[230]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Sinema joined a bipartisan majority and voted against an amendment to a defense appropriations bill (offered by Amash) to prohibit the NSA from monitoring and recording details of U.S. citizens' telecommunications without a warrant.[231]\n\n\n\n### Senate filibuster[edit]\n\n\nEarly in her career, Sinema expressed enthusiasm about evading the Senate filibuster through the reconciliation process.[232]\n\n\nOn January 25, 2021, a spokesperson for Sinema told *The Washington Post* that she is \"against eliminating the filibuster\" and \"not open to changing her mind\" on the issue.[233][234] Additionally, Sinema has spoken out on the elimination of the judicial filibuster as a key reason for increased politicization of the judiciary.[235]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Sinema and Democratic Senate colleague Joe Manchin voted against changing the Senate filibuster rule. The proposed rule change, which would have allowed certain voting rights bills to advance to the Senate floor without meeting the Senate's 60-vote threshold, was voted down by a 52-48 margin.[236] Days later, the Arizona Democratic Party executive committee censured Sinema for voting to retain the filibuster rule.[237]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Sinema was one of five House Democrats to vote for a Republican-backed bill barring the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from regulating broadband rates. Her vote broke from her party; other Democrats were strongly opposed to the measure, and President Obama said he would veto it if it passed.[238]\n\n\nIn 2019, Sinema was the sole Senate Democrat not to co-sponsor the Save the Internet Act, which would restore Obama-era regulations preventing ISPs from throttling consumers' website traffic. She worked with Senate Republican Roger Wicker to develop their own net neutrality bill.[239]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinema married, and later divorced, her BYU classmate Blake Dain.[240][24] She is bisexual.[241] She has been reported to be the only atheist member of Congress,[242][243] although she has rejected the label.[73]\n\n\n\n### Amateur athlete[edit]\n\n\nSinema has completed numerous marathons. In 2019, she completed a marathon in 3:28:17, which was fast enough for her (female) age group to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Two weeks before her Boston-qualifying race, she ran a three-mile race in 20:42, setting a record for women in Congress.[244] In 2020, she set a personal record of 3:21:45 and later in 2021, she broke her right foot while running a marathon, requiring her to use a hands-free crutch.[245]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2013, Sinema completed an Ironman Triathlon in a little over 15 hours. She was the second active member of Congress, after Senator Jeff Merkley, to finish a long-distance triathlon, and the first to complete an Ironman-branded race.[246] She completed the 2015 Ironman World Championship in Kona, Hawaii.[28]\n\n\nOn December 25, 2013, Sinema climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.[247]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Kyrsten Sinema\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Sinema, Kyrsten (2009). *Unite and Conquer: How to Build Coalitions That Win and Last*.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the U.S. representative for Nevada's 3rd congressional district from 2017 to 2019.\n\n\nRosen was elected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Dean Heller.[1] She was the only House freshman to win a Senate seat in the 2018 midterm elections and the only challenger to defeat a Republican incumbent senator in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nRosen was born on August 2, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois, to Carol, a homemaker,[2][3][4] and Leonard Spektor, a car dealership owner who had served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War.[3] Rosen's mother was of Irish, German, and Austrian descent, and her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia and Austria.[5]\n\n\nRosen attended the University of Minnesota and graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1979.[6] While she was in college, her parents moved to Las Vegas, where Rosen moved after graduating. She took a job with Summa Corporation and worked summers as a waitress at Caesars Palace throughout the 1980s. While working for Summa, she attended Clark County Community College (now the College of Southern Nevada) and received an associate degree in computing and information technology in 1985.[6] She began working for Southwest Gas from 1990 to 1993.[7]\n\n\nRosen has touted her efforts to \"build a business\", but a Reno Gazette Journal review of public records found no evidence that she held a state or local business license. According to Rosen, she ran a company between 1993 and 2002 of which she was the only employee. Her business served two main clients, Southwest Gas, which was Rosen’s former employer, and Radiology Specialists, a Las Vegas-based physician group that employed Rosen’s husband.[8]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosen during the 115th Congress as a U.S. Representative\nSee also: 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada § District 3\n\nA former computer programmer with no political experience at the time, Rosen was asked by U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, also from Nevada, to run in the 2016 election for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Republican Joe Heck.[9] On January 26, she declared her candidacy for Nevada's 3rd congressional district.[10] Rosen won 60% of the vote in the Democratic primary election[11] and narrowly[9] defeated Republican nominee Danny Tarkanian in the general election.[12] She was sworn into office on January 3, 2017.\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Personnel\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces\n* Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Research and Technology\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Arts Caucus[13]\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[14]\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues[15]\n* Problem Solvers Caucus[16]\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Nevada\n\nRosen was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 6, 2018, defeating one-term Republican senator Dean Heller to become the junior senator from Nevada. Her candidacy, announced on July 5, 2017, was endorsed by former President Barack Obama[17] and former vice president Joe Biden.[9] During the campaign, Rosen emphasized her support for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and criticized Heller's vote to repeal it in 2017.[18][19] At the time, Rosen voted in the U.S. House against Republicans' attempts to repeal Obamacare.[19]\n\n\nRosen defeated Heller, 50.4%–45.4%. Heller carried 15 of Nevada's 17 county-level jurisdictions, but Rosen carried the state's two largest, Clark (home to Las Vegas) and Washoe (home to Reno). She won Clark County by over 92,000 votes, almost double her statewide margin of more than 48,900 votes.[20]\n\n\nRosen was one of only two non-incumbent Democrats, alongside Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, to win election to the Senate in 2018. She is also the 37th freshman member of the U.S. House to win a Senate seat and the first woman to do so.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nRosen was on Capitol Hill for the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. At the time, she was in the Russell Senate Office Building before being evacuated to a secure, undisclosed location. She tweeted during the attack, calling the event \"reprehensible\" and writing, \"It's time for us as a nation to come together and denounce hate and violence.\"[22]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation and Space\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Security\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\t+ Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n* Special Committee on Aging\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nRosen has been described as a liberal Democrat at times and as a moderate at others.[23][24][25] As of April 2020, *FiveThirtyEight* found that Rosen's votes aligned with President Trump's legislative positions about 36% of the time.[26] The American Conservative Union gave her a 5% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[27]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports abortion rights and has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America.[28]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Rosen was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America.\" The letter asserted that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[29]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports an assault weapons ban.[24]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports the Affordable Care Act and its provisions that prevent patients from being denied insurance or charged more due to age or a preexisting condition. She supports allowing citizens to buy into Medicaid as an alternative option that would compete with private insurance companies.[30][31]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018-2019 government shutdown, Rosen was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the FDA's efforts to address the effect of the shutdown on the public health and employees while remaining alarmed \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[32]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Rosen was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi over increased insulin prices, saying the increases kept patients from receiving \"access to the life-saving medications they need.\"[33]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Rosen was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences if the *Texas v. United States* Affordable Care Act lawsuit prevailed in courts. They wrote that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".[34]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Rosen was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[35]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports \"comprehensive immigration reform\" but does not believe the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency should be abolished.[24]\n\n\n\n### Jobs and economy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Rosen was one of three U.S. House Democrats to break with their party and vote to make individual tax cuts permanent.[36] She supports a $15 hourly minimum wage.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRosen resides in Henderson, Nevada, with her husband, Larry, a radiologist.[37][7] They have a daughter.[38] Before entering politics, she served as the president of the Congregation Ner Tamid synagogue, a Reform Jewish synagogue in Henderson.[7][39] She has cited the philosophy of *tikkun olam* as a key part of her decision to enter politics.[40]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2016 Nevada's 3rd congressional district primary election\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **14,219**  | **62.2%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Jesse Sbaih\n | 2,928\n | 12.8%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Barry Michaels\n | 2,218\n | 9.7%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Steven Schiffman\n | 1,237\n | 5.4%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Alex Singer\n | 1,207\n | 5.3%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Neil Waite\n | 1,055\n | 4.6%\n |\n\n\n**Source:**[41]\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Nevada's 3rd congressional district election[42]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **146,869**  | **47.2%**  |\n|  | Republican | Danny Tarkanian\n | 142,926\n | 46.0%\n |\n|  | Independent American | Warren Markowitz\n | 11,602\n | 3.7 %\n |\n|  | Independent | David Goossen\n | 9,566\n | 3.1%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **310,963**  | **100.0**  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican |\n\n\n**Source:**[42]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018 United States Senate Democratic primary in Nevada\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **110,530**  | **77.1%**  |\n|  | None of These Candidates | None of These Candidates\n | 10,070\n | 7.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | David Knight\n | 6,340\n | 4.4%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Allen Rheinhart\n | 4,774\n | 3.3%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Jesse Sbaih\n | 4,538\n | 3.2%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bobby Mahendra\n | 3,833\n | 2.7%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Danny Burleigh\n | 3,244\n | 2.3%\n |\n\n\n**Source:**[43]\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 United States Senate election in Nevada[44]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **490,071**  | **50.4%**  |\n|  | Republican | Dean Heller (Incumbent)\n | 441,202\n | 45.4%\n |\n|  | None of These Candidates | None of These Candidates\n | 15,303\n | 1.6%\n |\n|  | Independent | Barry Michaels\n | 9,269\n | 1.0%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Tim Hagan\n | 9,196\n | 0.9%\n |\n|  | Independent American | Kamau Bakari\n | 7,091\n | 0.7%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **972,132**  | **100.0**  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican |\n\n\n**Source:**[44]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Jewish members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Midterm Election Results Leave a Divided Congress\". *The New York Times*.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the U.S. representative for Nevada's 3rd congressional district from 2017 to 2019.\n\n\nRosen was elected to the Senate in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Dean Heller.[1] She was the only House freshman to win a Senate seat in the 2018 midterm elections and the only challenger to defeat a Republican incumbent senator in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nRosen was born on August 2, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois, to Carol, a homemaker,[2][3][4] and Leonard Spektor, a car dealership owner who had served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War.[3] Rosen's mother was of Irish, German, and Austrian descent, and her father's family were Jewish emigrants from Russia and Austria.[5]\n\n\nRosen attended the University of Minnesota and graduated with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1979.[6] While she was in college, her parents moved to Las Vegas, where Rosen moved after graduating. She took a job with Summa Corporation and worked summers as a waitress at Caesars Palace throughout the 1980s. While working for Summa, she attended Clark County Community College (now the College of Southern Nevada) and received an associate degree in computing and information technology in 1985.[6] She began working for Southwest Gas from 1990 to 1993.[7]\n\n\nRosen has touted her efforts to \"build a business\", but a Reno Gazette Journal review of public records found no evidence that she held a state or local business license. According to Rosen, she ran a company between 1993 and 2002 of which she was the only employee. Her business served two main clients, Southwest Gas, which was Rosen’s former employer, and Radiology Specialists, a Las Vegas-based physician group that employed Rosen’s husband.[8]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rosen during the 115th Congress as a U.S. Representative\nSee also: 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada § District 3\n\nA former computer programmer with no political experience at the time, Rosen was asked by U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, also from Nevada, to run in the 2016 election for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Republican Joe Heck.[9] On January 26, she declared her candidacy for Nevada's 3rd congressional district.[10] Rosen won 60% of the vote in the Democratic primary election[11] and narrowly[9] defeated Republican nominee Danny Tarkanian in the general election.[12] She was sworn into office on January 3, 2017.\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Personnel\n\t+ Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces\n* Committee on Science, Space, and Technology\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Research and Technology\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Arts Caucus[13]\n* Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus[14]\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues[15]\n* Problem Solvers Caucus[16]\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Nevada\n\nRosen was elected to the U.S. Senate on November 6, 2018, defeating one-term Republican senator Dean Heller to become the junior senator from Nevada. Her candidacy, announced on July 5, 2017, was endorsed by former President Barack Obama[17] and former vice president Joe Biden.[9] During the campaign, Rosen emphasized her support for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and criticized Heller's vote to repeal it in 2017.[18][19] At the time, Rosen voted in the U.S. House against Republicans' attempts to repeal Obamacare.[19]\n\n\nRosen defeated Heller, 50.4%–45.4%. Heller carried 15 of Nevada's 17 county-level jurisdictions, but Rosen carried the state's two largest, Clark (home to Las Vegas) and Washoe (home to Reno). She won Clark County by over 92,000 votes, almost double her statewide margin of more than 48,900 votes.[20]\n\n\nRosen was one of only two non-incumbent Democrats, alongside Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, to win election to the Senate in 2018. She is also the 37th freshman member of the U.S. House to win a Senate seat and the first woman to do so.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nRosen was on Capitol Hill for the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol. At the time, she was in the Russell Senate Office Building before being evacuated to a secure, undisclosed location. She tweeted during the attack, calling the event \"reprehensible\" and writing, \"It's time for us as a nation to come together and denounce hate and violence.\"[22]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Aviation and Space\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet\n\t+ Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Trade and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Security\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\n\t+ Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n* Special Committee on Aging\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nRosen has been described as a liberal Democrat at times and as a moderate at others.[23][24][25] As of April 2020, *FiveThirtyEight* found that Rosen's votes aligned with President Trump's legislative positions about 36% of the time.[26] The American Conservative Union gave her a 5% lifetime conservative rating in 2020.[27]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports abortion rights and has been endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice America.[28]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Rosen was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Trump encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America.\" The letter asserted that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S. by helping to improve conditions in those countries.[29]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports an assault weapons ban.[24]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports the Affordable Care Act and its provisions that prevent patients from being denied insurance or charged more due to age or a preexisting condition. She supports allowing citizens to buy into Medicaid as an alternative option that would compete with private insurance companies.[30][31]\n\n\nIn January 2019, during the 2018-2019 government shutdown, Rosen was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to Commissioner of Food and Drugs Scott Gottlieb recognizing the FDA's efforts to address the effect of the shutdown on the public health and employees while remaining alarmed \"that the continued shutdown will result in increasingly harmful effects on the agency's employees and the safety and security of the nation's food and medical products.\"[32]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Rosen was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to insulin manufactures Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi over increased insulin prices, saying the increases kept patients from receiving \"access to the life-saving medications they need.\"[33]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Rosen was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar requesting data from the Trump administration in order to help states and Congress understand the potential consequences if the *Texas v. United States* Affordable Care Act lawsuit prevailed in courts. They wrote that an overhaul of the present health care system would form \"an enormous hole in the pocketbooks of the people we serve as well as wreck state budgets\".[34]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Rosen was one of 41 senators to sign a bipartisan letter to the housing subcommittee praising the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 4 Capacity Building program as authorizing \"HUD to partner with national nonprofit community development organizations to provide education, training, and financial support to local community development corporations (CDCs) across the country\" and expressing disappointment that Trump's budget \"has slated this program for elimination after decades of successful economic and community development.\" The senators wrote of their hope that the subcommittee would support continued funding for Section 4 in Fiscal Year 2020.[35]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nRosen supports \"comprehensive immigration reform\" but does not believe the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency should be abolished.[24]\n\n\n\n### Jobs and economy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Rosen was one of three U.S. House Democrats to break with their party and vote to make individual tax cuts permanent.[36] She supports a $15 hourly minimum wage.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRosen resides in Henderson, Nevada, with her husband, Larry, a radiologist.[37][7] They have a daughter.[38] Before entering politics, she served as the president of the Congregation Ner Tamid synagogue, a Reform Jewish synagogue in Henderson.[7][39] She has cited the philosophy of *tikkun olam* as a key part of her decision to enter politics.[40]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2016 Nevada's 3rd congressional district primary election\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **14,219**  | **62.2%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Jesse Sbaih\n | 2,928\n | 12.8%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Barry Michaels\n | 2,218\n | 9.7%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Steven Schiffman\n | 1,237\n | 5.4%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Alex Singer\n | 1,207\n | 5.3%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Neil Waite\n | 1,055\n | 4.6%\n |\n\n\n**Source:**[41]\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Nevada's 3rd congressional district election[42]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **146,869**  | **47.2%**  |\n|  | Republican | Danny Tarkanian\n | 142,926\n | 46.0%\n |\n|  | Independent American | Warren Markowitz\n | 11,602\n | 3.7 %\n |\n|  | Independent | David Goossen\n | 9,566\n | 3.1%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **310,963**  | **100.0**  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican |\n\n\n**Source:**[42]\n\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018 United States Senate Democratic primary in Nevada\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **110,530**  | **77.1%**  |\n|  | None of These Candidates | None of These Candidates\n | 10,070\n | 7.0%\n |\n|  | Democratic | David Knight\n | 6,340\n | 4.4%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Allen Rheinhart\n | 4,774\n | 3.3%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Jesse Sbaih\n | 4,538\n | 3.2%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bobby Mahendra\n | 3,833\n | 2.7%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Danny Burleigh\n | 3,244\n | 2.3%\n |\n\n\n**Source:**[43]\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 United States Senate election in Nevada[44]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Jacky Rosen**  | **490,071**  | **50.4%**  |\n|  | Republican | Dean Heller (Incumbent)\n | 441,202\n | 45.4%\n |\n|  | None of These Candidates | None of These Candidates\n | 15,303\n | 1.6%\n |\n|  | Independent | Barry Michaels\n | 9,269\n | 1.0%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Tim Hagan\n | 9,196\n | 0.9%\n |\n|  | Independent American | Kamau Bakari\n | 7,091\n | 0.7%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **972,132**  | **100.0**  |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican |\n\n\n**Source:**[44]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Jewish members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Midterm Election Results Leave a Divided Congress\". *The New York Times*.

A member of the Republican Party, she has held her seat since 1997 and is Maine's longest-serving senator.\n\n\nBorn in Caribou, Maine, Collins is a graduate of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. Beginning her career as a staff assistant for Senator William Cohen in 1975, she became staff director of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee of the Committee on Governmental Affairs (which later became the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs)[1] in 1981. Governor John R. McKernan Jr. then appointed her commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation in 1987. In 1992 President George H. W. Bush appointed her director of the Small Business Administration's regional office in Boston. Collins became a deputy state treasurer in the office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts in 1993.[2] After moving back to Maine in 1994, she became the Republican nominee for governor of Maine in the 1994 general election. She was the first female major-party nominee for the post, finishing third in a four-way race with 23% of the vote. After her bid for governor in 1994, she became the founding director of the Center for Family Business at Husson University in Bangor, Maine.\n\n\nCollins was first elected to the Senate in 1996. She was reelected in 2002, in 2008, in 2014, and in 2020. She chaired the Senate Special Committee on Aging from 2015 to 2021 and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs from 2003 to 2007. Collins is a senior Republican woman in the Senate, the dean of Maine's congressional delegation, and the only New England Republican in the 116th, 117th, and 118th Congresses.[3] As of the 118th Congress, Collins is the only Republican to represent a Northeastern state in the Senate. She has been called a moderate Republican, and is often a pivotal vote in the Senate.[4][5] To date, Collins is the longest-serving Republican woman in the Senate.[6][7]\n\n\nCollins, who has described herself as a pro-choice Republican, attracted controversy for her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She attributed her vote to her belief that Kavanaugh would not support overturning *Roe v. Wade*; in June 2022, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe*. \n\n\nDuring the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, Collins was one of 10 Republican senators to vote to acquit him on the first charge and one of five to vote to acquit on the second, and during the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Collins joined all Senate Republicans but one in voting to acquit him on the first charge, and all Republicans to acquit on the second. She was the only Republican senator to vote against confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020. On February 13, 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nOne of six children, Collins was born in Caribou, Maine, where her family operates a lumber business established by her great-great-great-grandfather, Samuel W. Collins, in 1844.[8] Her parents, Patricia (née McGuigan) and Donald Collins (1925–2018), each served as mayor of Caribou.[8] Her father, a decorated veteran of World War II, also served in the Maine Legislature, with one term in the House, and four in the Senate.[9][10]\n\n\nCollins's mother was born in Barrancabermeja, Colombia, to American parents.[11] Collins is of English and Irish ancestry. Her uncle, Samuel W. Collins Jr., sat on the Maine Supreme Judicial Court from 1988 to 1994 and served in the Maine Senate from 1973 to 1984.[12]\n\n\nCollins attended Caribou High School, where she was president of the student council.[13] During her senior year of high school in 1971, she was chosen to participate in the U.S. Senate Youth Program, through which she visited Washington, D.C., for the first time and had a two-hour conversation with Maine's first female United States Senator, Margaret Chase Smith, also a Republican. Collins is the first program delegate elected to the Senate and holds the seat once held by Smith.[13] After graduating from high school, she continued her education at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York.[14] Like her father, she was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa national academic honor society. She graduated from St. Lawrence *magna cum laude* with a bachelor's degree in government in 1975.[15]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nFollowing graduation, Collins worked as a legislative assistant to U.S. Representative and later U.S. Senator William Cohen from 1975 to 1987.[14] She was also staff director of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee on the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs from 1981 to 1987.[14]\n\n\nIn 1987, Collins joined the cabinet of Governor John R. McKernan Jr. as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation.[15] President George H. W. Bush appointed her the New England regional director for the Small Business Administration in 1992.[10] After briefly serving in this post until the 1992 election of President Bill Clinton, she moved to Massachusetts and became Deputy State Treasurer of Massachusetts under Joe Malone in 1993.[14]\n\n\nReturning to Maine, Collins won an eight-way Republican primary in the 1994 gubernatorial election, becoming the first woman nominated by a major party for governor of Maine.[10] During the campaign, she received little support from Republican leaders and was criticized by conservative groups for her more liberal views on social issues. She lost the general election, receiving 23% of the vote and placing third behind Democrat Joseph E. Brennan and the winner, Independent candidate Angus King, her future Senate colleague.[16]\n\n\nIn December 1994, Collins became the founding executive director of the Richard E. Dyke Center for Family Business at Husson College.[15] She served in this post until 1996, when she announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by her former boss, William Cohen, who retired to become United States Secretary of Defense under President Clinton. With Cohen's public endorsement, she won a difficult four-way primary and faced Brennan, her opponent in the 1994 gubernatorial election, in the general election. She defeated him, 49% to 44%.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Collins with President Barack Obama\nCollins was elected to the Senate in 1996. During the campaign she pledged that, if elected, she would serve only two terms.[19]\n\n\nCollins was reelected in 2002 over State Senator Chellie Pingree, 58%–42%, in 2008 over Representative Tom Allen, 61.5%–38.5%, and in 2014 over Shenna Bellows, 68.5%–31.5%. In her first three reelection campaigns, she carried every county in Maine.[20]\n\n\nIn 2020, Collins was challenged by Democratic State House Speaker Sara Gideon. The hotly contested race became the most expensive in Maine history, with Collins spending $23 million and Gideon nearly $48 million.[21] The race also had national implications, as defeating Collins was a key part of the Democrats' strategy to achieve a Senate majority. Despite trailing Gideon in every public poll of the race,[22] Collins defeated Gideon[23] by a decisive margin.[24]\n\n\nIn 2009, Collins was called one of \"the last survivors of a once common species of moderate Northeastern Republican\".[12] She is considered a centrist Republican and an influential player in the Senate.[25][26][27]\n\n\nAlthough she shared a centrist ideology with Maine's former senator, Olympia Snowe, Collins is considered a \"half-turn more conservative\" than Snowe.[12] She was consistently endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, until 2020.[28] She supported John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. She became the state's senior senator in 2013 when Snowe left the Senate and was replaced by independent Angus King, who defeated Collins in the 1994 governor election.[29]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### First term[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Collins played an important role during the Senate's impeachment trial of Bill Clinton when she and Snowe sponsored a motion that would have allowed the Senate to vote separately on the charges and the remedy. The motion failed, and Snowe and Collins voted to acquit, believing that while Clinton had committed perjury, that was not grounds for removal from office.[30]\n\n\nIn March 1997, the Senate adopted a broader investigation into White House and Congressional campaign fund-raising practices than Senate Republicans initially wanted. Collins said there were \"a number of allegations that may or may not be illegal, but they may be improper.\"[31]\n\n\nIn a May 1997 interview, Collins stated her support for a proposal by Tom Daschle banning all abortions after the fetus is capable of living outside the womb except to save the life of the woman or protect her from physical injury. Of an alternative measure proposed by Rick Santorum that would ban partial-birth abortion, Collins said it \"ignores cases in the medical literature involving women with very serious physical health problems\".[32]\n\n\nIn 2001 Collins authored a measure that granted the United States Secretary of Education authority to grant waivers that would relieve reservists and members of the National Guard from making federal student loan payments during active duty and grant the same privileges to victims and families of those affected by the September 11 attacks. The bill passed the Senate and House in December 2001.[33]\n\n\nIn November 2002, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Department of Homeland Security while a Democratic effort to remove the bill's provisions fell short on a 52-to-47 vote that came after President George W. Bush lobbied against the vote. Collins and other senators said that Senate and House Republicans, as well as the White House, had given them an \"ironclad promise\" to essentially rescind provisions in the first spending bill to pass Congress the following year.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Second term[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Collins was one of the primary sponsors of legislation overhauling the U.S. intelligence community by creating a new post, Director of National Intelligence, to oversee budgets and most assets of the spy agencies, and mandating that federal agencies establish minimum standards for states pertaining to issuing driver's licenses and birth certificates along with directing the United States Department of Homeland Security to form standards for ID used to board airplanes. The bill passed in the House and Senate in December. Collins said, \"This was the most difficult bill to bring from conception to birth that I can imagine being involved with. But that makes the victory doubly satisfying.\"[35] Bush signed the bill, formally known as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, on December 17, 2004.[36]\n\n\nIn May 2005, Collins was one of 14 senators (seven Democrats and seven Republicans) to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus allowing the Republican leadership to end debate without having to exercise the nuclear option. Under the agreement, Democrats agreed they would filibuster Bush's judicial nominees only in \"extraordinary circumstances\"; three Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate; and two others, Henry Saad and William Myers, were expressly denied such protection (both eventually withdrew their names from consideration).[37][38]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Collins criticized robocalls by the McCain campaign claiming that Barack Obama \"has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans\", asserting that those \"kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics\" and urging McCain to cease the calls immediately.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Third term[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Collins was criticized for blocking flu relief funding during the swine flu pandemic. She said she had done so on procedural grounds, because the funding did not belong in a stimulus bill: \"while worthwhile, [it does] not boost our economy,\" and \"it does not make sense to include $870 million for pandemic flu preparedness.\"[40]\n\n\nIn April 2010, Collins and Senator Joe Lieberman issued a subpoena seeking documents and interviews associated with the American government's investigation into the conduct of investigators during their interactions with Nidal Hasan before the Fort Hood shooting. The Pentagon announced that the Obama administration would not authorize Senate investigators to question intelligence agents who reviewed e-mails between Hasan and an extremist Islamic cleric before the shooting. Collins and Lieberman issued a statement accusing the Departments of Justice and Defense of refusing \"to provide access to their agents who reportedly reviewed Major Hasan's communications with radical extremist cleric Anwar al Awlaki and to transcripts of prosecution interviews with Hasan's associates and superiors, which DOD already provided to its internal review.\"[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Collins, right, stands near President Barack Obama as he signs the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell\nIn May 2010, Collins and Snowe were the only two Republicans to vote for an unsuccessful Democratic measure that would have prevented bailouts, highlighted financial products of complexity and toughened consumer protection.[42]\n\n\nIn February 2013, Collins announced her opposition to the confirmation of Chuck Hagel for United States Secretary of Defense, citing her belief that Hagel's \"past positions, votes and statements [do not] match the challenges of our time.\" The announcement came as a surprise, as Collins was considered a possible supporter of his nomination, and it occurred while the nomination was being filibustered.[43] The filibuster on Hagel's nomination was defeated,[44] and he was confirmed later that month.[45]\n\n\nIn May 2013, following a report that the Internal Revenue Service had put additional scrutiny on conservative groups, Collins said the revelation \"contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government\" and added that she was disappointed that Obama \"hasn't personally condemned this and spoken out\".[46]\n\n\nIn April 2014, the Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over two years.[47] The bill was strongly supported by Obama and many Democratic senators but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.[48][49][50] Collins tried to negotiate a compromise bill that centrist Republicans could agree to but was unable to do so.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Collins, Lamar Alexander, and Lindsey Graham meet with President Donald Trump in November 2017\nIn May 2016, the Senate passed an appropriations bill containing an amendment by Collins that she said would help prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from gaining \"national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country\". The legislation was given a veto threat by the White House, which was said by the Office of Management and Budget to oppose \"the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation\".[51]\n\n\nIn 2016, Collins authored the Safe Treatments and Opportunities to Prevent Pain Act, a provision intended to encourage the National Institutes of Health to further its research into opioid therapy alternatives for pain management, and the Infant Plan of Safe Care Act, which mandated that states ensure safe care plans are developed for infants who are drug-dependent before they are discharged from hospitals. These provisions were included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act,[52] legislation that created programs and expanded treatment access alongside implementing $181 million in new spending as part of an attempt to curb heroin and opioid addiction. Obama signed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act into law on July 22, 2016.[53]\n\n\nOn August 8, 2016, Collins announced that she would not vote for Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election. She said that as a lifelong Republican she did not make the decision lightly but felt he was unsuitable for office, \"based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics\".[54] She considered voting for the Libertarian Party's ticket or a write-in candidate.[55][56]\n\n\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Collins received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Washington.[57]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski voted for Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, within the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, passing DeVos's nomination by a vote of 12–11 to allow the full Senate to vote. Collins justified her vote, saying, \"Presidents are entitled to considerable deference in the selection of Cabinet members.\"[58][59][60] Later, she and Murkowski were the only Republicans to break party lines and vote against DeVos's confirmation.[61][62] This caused a 50–50 tie that was broken by Senate President Mike Pence to confirm DeVos.[63]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Collins said she could not support the American Health Care Act, the House Republicans' plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[64] She announced she would vote against the Senate version of the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare.[65] Collins also clarified that she opposed repealing the ACA without a replacement proposal.[66] On July 26, Collins was one of seven Republicans in voting against repealing the ACA without a suitable replacement.[67] On July 27, she joined two other Republicans in voting against the \"skinny\" repeal of the ACA.[68] In October, Collins called on Trump to support a bipartisan Congressional effort led by Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray to reinstate insurer payments, saying that what Trump was doing was \"affecting people's access and the cost of health care right now\".[69]\n\n\nOn December 14, 2017, the day the FCC was set to hold a vote on net neutrality, Collins and King sent the FCC a letter asking that the vote be postponed to allow public hearings on the merits of repealing net neutrality.[70] They expressed concerns that repealing net neutrality could adversely affect the U.S. economy.[70] As part of this drive, Collins is reported to support using the authority under the Congressional Review Act to nullify the FCC's repeal vote.[71] In 2018, Collins was one of three Republicans voting with Democrats to repeal rule changes enacted by the Republican-controlled FCC.[72] The measure was meant to restore Obama-era net neutrality rules.[73]\n\n\nIn 2017, The Lugar Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded by Senator Richard Lugar, released a bipartisan index in cooperation with Georgetown University that ranked Collins the most bipartisan senator during the first session of the 115th Congress (and the only U.S. Senator from the Northeast ranked among the top 10 most bipartisan senators).[74][75]\n\n\nIn January 2018, in response to the Trump administration's not implementing congressionally approved sanctions on Russia, Collins said it was confirmed Russia had tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, adding, \"not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year.\" She noted that the legislation received bipartisan support and predicted Russia would also attempt to interfere in the 2018 elections.[76] In January 2019, Collins was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to block Trump from lifting sanctions on three Russian companies. She said she disagreed with \"the easing of the sanctions because I think it sends the wrong message to Russia and to the oligarch and close ally of Mr. Putin, Oleg Deripaska, who will in my judgment continue to maintain considerable [ownership] under the Treasury's plan.\"[77]\n\n\nIn 2018, Collins and Senators Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Shelley Moore Capito authored the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, legislation centered on providing a public health approach to Alzheimer's. The bill would authorize $20 million annually to establish the \"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Public Health Centers of Excellence\" and aid statewide efforts to promote brain health and reduce cognitive decline. It passed the Senate and House and was signed by Trump in January 2019.[78]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Collins authored two bills as part of the Opioid Crisis Response Act, a bipartisan package of 70 Senate bills that would alter programs across multiple agencies in an effort to prevent opioids from being shipped through the U.S. Postal Service and grant doctors the ability to prescribe medications designed to wean opioid addictions. The bills passed 99 to 1.[79][80]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Collins was one of five senators to sponsor legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to mint coins honoring George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush under the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005[81] and introduced the Reviving America's Scenic Byways Act of 2019 along with Ben Cardin. The bill required the Secretary of Transportation to request nominations and make determinations in regard to roads that would be designed under a voluntary, community-based program and was signed into law by Trump in September of that year.[82] After the Senate Intelligence Committee held a closed-door meeting with Michael Cohen, Collins said senators \"clearly need to re-interview some witnesses whose accounts [Cohen] contradicts\". Her comment was seen as hinting at the Intelligence Committee's interest in speaking with Donald Trump Jr. again.[83] In June, Collins cosponsored an amendment to form the John S. McCain III Human Rights Commission, which would hold hearings and briefings on human rights violations ahead of collaborations with the Trump administration to address the violations, and be included in a defense authorization bill McCain had helped create as Armed Services Committee chairman.[84]\n\n\nIn her May 2019 commencement speech at Maine Maritime Academy, Collins said getting the Senate to approve funding for a new training ship for the academy was her \"number one priority\" and that funding was included in Trump's proposed budget while she would still seek further funds through other measures.[85]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Collins cosponsored the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a new, privately funded memorial that would be constructed on federal lands in Washington, D.C. in order to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters who died in the line of duty. Collins called freedom of the press \"one of our fundamental constitutional rights\" and spoke of the risks of reprisals faced by reporters around the world for their work.[86]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Collins voted \"not guilty\" on both articles in the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump.[87]\n\n\nOn October 26, 2020, Collins was the only Republican senator to vote against the confirmation of Trump's nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 52–48.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Fifth term[edit]\n\n\nCollins giving her 2021 United States Electoral College vote count speech after the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nOn January 6, 2021, Collins was participating in the certification of the Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. She was on the Senate floor listening to speeches related to the objection to counting Arizona's votes when the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate and U.S. Capitol Police removed Vice President Mike Pence and Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. She called the experience \"frightening and appalling.\"[89] Collins later called the attack \"a dangerous, shameful, and outrageous attack on our democracy\" and blamed Trump for \"working up the crowd and inciting this mob\". She called on him to call off the rioters. When Congress reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Collins voted to certify the count.[90]\n\n\nToward the end of January 2021, Collins led a group of 10 Republican senators who requested that President Joe Biden join bipartisan negotiations when creating his COVID-19 economic relief package.[91] After meeting with the group, Biden opted to pass his relief package using the reconciliation process, for which he did not need Republican support.[92]\n\n\nOn February 13, 2021, Collins was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial.[93]\n\n\nPolitical analysis website FiveThirtyEight found that Collins had voted in line with President Joe Biden around 67% of the time in the 117th Congress.[94]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2021, Axios[95] revealed the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation of defense contractor Martin Kao, former CEO of Navatek,[96][97] who funneled $150,000 to a pro-Collins super PAC, 1820PAC, via a shell LLC, Society for Young Women Scientists and Engineers, as a federal contractor, and reimbursed donations to the Collins 2020 campaign, both of which are illegal. A spokesperson said that the campaign had no knowledge of the exchange.[98][99]\n\n\nCollins cast her 8,000th consecutive roll call vote on October 28, 2021; only Chuck Grassley and William Proxmire have set longer streaks.[100]\n\n\nCollins voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her one of the only three GOP senators to support her nomination, the other two being Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney.[101]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nCollins's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[102]\n\n\n\n* **Committee on Appropriations (Vice Chair)**\n\t+ As Vice Chair, Collins is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees. Nevertheless, she also serves as vice chair of the Subcommittee on Defense in an individual capacity.\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Afterschool Caucuses[103]\n* Republican Main Street Partnership[104]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Susan Collins\n\n![](image)With former U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe (also R-ME)\nCollins has been described as a moderate Republican and a centrist,[105][106] having voted with her party 59% of the time from 1997 to 2016. She voted with her party more often, about 87% of the time, in 2017, at the beginning of the Trump administration.[107][108][109]\n\n\nIn 2013, Collins sided with Obama's position 75.9% of the time, one of only two Republicans to vote with him more than 70% of the time.[110] As of January 2021, according to *FiveThirtyEight*, she had voted with Trump's positions about 65% of the time, the lowest among all Republican senators.[111] During Trump's presidency she voted with the Republican majority on party-line votes much more often than during Obama's presidency.[107] According to FiveThirtyEight, as of October 2022, she has voted with Biden's position about 69.1% of the time.[112]\n\n\nCollins voted to acquit Trump of all charges at his first impeachment trial.[113] She said she did not think Trump's request that the Ukrainian President announce an investigation into Joe Biden met the \"high bar\" for \"removing a duly elected president\".[114] She said Trump had \"learned from this case\" and \"will be much more cautious in the future.\"[114] Shortly after his acquittal, Trump fired witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.[115][116] In the following months, he fired inspectors general of the State Department and the intelligence community. Collins criticized the firing, provoking a retaliatory response from Trump.[117]\n\n\nOn February 13, 2021, Collins was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial.[118] On May 27, 2021, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, she voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack. She had amended the bill in the hopes of drawing sufficient Republicans to support it, but the vote failed for lack of 60 required \"yes\" votes to prevent a filibuster.[119]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nCollins is one of two Republican U.S. Senators, along with Lisa Murkowski, who describe themselves as pro-choice, or pro-abortion rights, and supported *Roe v. Wade*.[120][121][122]\n\n\nAccording to *HuffPost*, Collins has repeatedly voted to confirm judges who have signaled opposition to abortion rights. She has defended these votes by citing her support for both of Obama's Supreme Court appointments.[123] She voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying she did not believe he would overturn *Roe*.[124][125] She said she felt \"vindication\" in 2018 when Kavanaugh voted with the court's four Democratic-appointed justices and Chief Justice John Roberts not to hear cases against Planned Parenthood from Kansas and Louisiana, although Planned Parenthood disagreed with her assessment of the situation.[126][127] In 2020, Collins faced renewed criticism of her vote by progressive groups when Kavanaugh said states should be permitted to severely reduce access to and availability of abortion in his dissent in *June Medical Services LLC v Russo*.[128][129]\n\n\nIn 2021, Collins was one of three Republican senators to decline to sign an *amicus* brief supporting an anti-abortion Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.[130] She faced renewed criticism after Kavanaugh voted with the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject an emergency petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; the law went into effect while facing continued challenges in the courts.[131] Responding to the legislation and criticism, Collins denounced the Texas anti-abortion law as \"extreme, inhumane, and unconstitutional\" and said she supports the *Roe* precedent as the \"law of the land\".[132]\n\n\nIn 2022, Collins received additional criticism for her support of Kavanaugh after a leaked draft of the Supreme Court opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization indicated the Court would overturn *Roe v. Wade*, with Kavanaugh breaking with his statements that *Roe* was \"settled law\".[133][134][135][136] She has also received criticism for calling the police in reaction to chalk protests due to her votes to confirm justices involved in the draft ruling.[137][138][139][140]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Collins voted against the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022, a bill that would prohibit a variety of restrictions on access to abortion, on the basis that it went too far beyond the standards established in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[141][142] Collins joined Murkowski and Senator Kyrsten Sinema in drafting the Reproductive Choice Act, alternative legislation that would codify *Roe* and *Casey* into federal law more narrowly.[141][143][144]\n\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Collins expressed concerns about how the Bush administration wanted to implement its proposed plan to cut taxes.[145] She cited deficit concerns as a reason for opposing the plan,[145] but ultimately voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts in 2003 and for their extension in 2006.[146][147][148] Collins was one of just three Republican lawmakers to vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,[149] prompting heated criticism from the right for crossing party lines.\n\n\nIn December 2017, Collins voted to pass the 2017 Republican tax plan.[150] The bill greatly reduces corporate taxes while reducing taxes for some individuals and increasing them for others by removing some popular deductions.[150] The bill also repeals Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, leaving thirteen million Americans uninsured and raising premiums by an estimated additional 10% per year.[151][152] After the vote, Collins said she received assurances from congressional leaders that they would pass legislation intended to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the individual mandate's repeal.[152] When asked how she could vote for a bill that would increase the deficit by an estimated $1 trillion (over ten years) after having railed against the deficit during the Obama administration, Collins insisted that it would not increase the deficit. She said she had been advised in this determination by economists Glenn Hubbard, Larry Lindsey, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin.[153][150] Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote that Hubbard and Holtz-Eakin denied saying the plan would not increase the deficit.[154][155]\n\n\nAfter voting for the tax plan, Collins became the top recipient of political donations from private equity firms.[156] Blackstone chief executive Steven Schwarzman donated $2 million to Collins's PAC, and Ken Griffin of the hedge fund Citadel donated $1.5 million.[156]\n\n\nAlong with all other Senate and House Republicans, Collins voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[157] On September 30, 2021, she was one of 15 Senate Republicans to join all Democrats and both Independents to approve a temporary spending bill to continue government funding and avoid a government shutdown.[158][159] On October 7, 2021, she voted with 10 other Republicans and all members of the Democratic caucus to break the filibuster on raising the debt ceiling.[160][161] She voted with all Republicans against the legislation to raise the debt ceiling.[162]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Collins joined the bipartisan Gang of 20, which sought to break a deadlock on a bill allowing offshore drilling that would devote billions in proceeds to renewable energy development.[163][164]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Collins was the only Republican to vote against undoing an Obama administration rule that required coal mining companies to avoid contaminating local waterways.[165] She was the only Republican to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and later Andrew Wheeler, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.[166][167]\n\n\nIn 2017, Collins voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, after unsuccessfully attempting to remove that part of the bill.[168][*better source needed*]\n\n\nAs of 2022, Collins has a lifetime score of 60% from the League of Conservation Voters, the highest of any incumbent Senate Republican.[169]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy and national security[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Collins voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution authorizing President Bush to go to war against Iraq.[170] In November 2007, she was one of four Republicans to vote for a Democratic proposal of $50 billion that would condition further spending on a timeline for withdrawing troops, mandating that a withdrawal begin 30 days after the bill was enacted as part of a goal of removing all U.S. troops in Iraq by December 15, 2008. The bill failed to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.[171] In April 2008, Collins and Senators Ben Nelson and Evan Bayh met with Bush's advisor on Iraq and Afghanistan, Douglas Lute, and expressed support for a prohibition on spending for major reconstruction projects, the proposal requiring Iraqis to pay for its security forces to be trained and equipped and reimburse the American military for the estimated $153 million a month the military spent on fueling in combat operations in Iraq. Collins said after the meeting that while the administration did not have a view entirely similar to the senators', it at least seemed open to their proposal.[172] In June 2014, while growing violence erupted in Iraq under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Collins said the violence would have been slower had a residual NATO force been present in Iraq and that the question was whether airstrikes were effective.[173]\n\n\nIn September 2009, Collins said she was unsure whether sending more American troops to Afghanistan would help end the Afghanistan War, but cited the need for \"more American civilians to help build up institutions\" and growth of the Afghan army.[174] In 2010, she called for the removal of Arnold Fields as Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, citing his repeated expressing of concern for the SIGAR and his disappointment with the Obama administration's \"ongoing failure to take decisive action\".[175] In August 2017, Collins commended Trump for providing clarity after years of the U.S. lacking a \"clear focus and defined strategy\" with respect to Afghanistan and said he made the case that the Afghan government must participate \"in defending its people, ending havens for terrorists, and curtailing corruption\".[176]\n\n\nBefore Obama met President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping at an informal retreat in June 2013, Collins cosponsored legislation that would authorize the Commerce Department to investigate whether currency manipulation is a form of subsidization.[177] In April 2018, she said the U.S. needed \"a more nuanced approach\" in dealing with China but gave Trump \"credit for levying these tariffs against the Chinese, with whom we've talked for a decade about their unfair trade practices and their theft of intellectual property from American firms\", adding that while the U.S. needed to toughen its stance against China, it would need to do this in a manner that did not create \"a trade war and retaliation that will end up with our European and Asian competitors getting business that otherwise would have come to American farmers\".[178]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Collins was one of seven Senate Republicans not to sign a March 2015 letter to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran attempting to cast doubt on the Obama administration's authority to engage in nuclear-proliferation negotiations with Iran.[179] She announced her opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement later that year, saying it was \"fundamentally flawed because it leaves Iran as capable of building a nuclear weapon at the expiration of the agreement as it is today\", and predicted Iran \"will be a more dangerous and stronger nuclear threshold state\" after the agreement expires.[180] In June 2019, after the United States nearly launched an airstrike on Iran after Iran downed an American surveillance drone, Collins said the U.S. could not \"allow Iran to continue to launch this kind of attack\" but warned that miscalculations by either side \"could lead to a war in the Middle East\".[181]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Collins co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[182] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[183]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Collins was one of five Republican senators to vote against tabling a resolution that would cease the U.S. military's support for Saudi Arabia's bombing operations in Yemen.[184] In December, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote for the resolution withdrawing American armed forces' support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and an amendment by Todd Young ensuring midair refueling between American and Saudi Air Force did not resume.[185] Collins was one of seven Republicans to vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen in February 2019, and, in May 2019, she was one of seven Republicans to vote to override Trump's veto of the resolution on Yemen.[186] In June 2019, Collins was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump's Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales.[187]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Collins voted to confirm U.S. Representative John Ratcliffe as Director of National Intelligence. In 2019, there was bipartisan opposition to Ratcliffe's nomination. *The Washington Post* called Collins's support for Ratcliffe \"key\" to his 2020 confirmation.[188]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nCollins voted for the Manchin–Toomey bill to amend federal law to expand background checks for gun purchases.[189] She voted against a ban on high-capacity (more than ten rounds) magazines.[190] In 2014 she received a \"C\" grade on gun rights from the NRA Political Victory Fund,[191] rising to a \"B\" rating in 2020.[192] She received a D− from Gun Owners of America in 2012.[193]\n\n\nIn 2018, Collins co-sponsored the NICS Denial Notification Act,[194] legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.[195]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Collins supported the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, legislation enabling the attorney general to deny the sale of a firearm to people on the no-fly list or selectee list. It passed the House but failed to advance in the Senate.[196]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gun Owners of Maine gave Collins a B rating, writing, \"On 2nd Amendment issues, Susan Collins generally stands with gun owners. She has opposed magazine capacity restrictions and voted to prohibit lawsuits against gun manufacturers for crimes committed with guns.\"[197]\n\n\nIn 2022, Collins became one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which included a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases.[198]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Collins was one of six senators to introduce the Medicaid Coverage for Addiction Recovery Expansion Act, legislation that would allow treatment facilities with up to 40 beds reimbursement by Medicaid for 60 consecutive days of inpatient services and serve as a modification of the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Disease law, which authorized Medicaid coverage only for facilities with 16 or fewer beds.[199]\n\n\nThough she voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Collins (along with fellow Republicans John McCain and Lisa Murkowski) voted against an unsuccessful \"skinny repeal\" attempt in July 2017.[200] Later that year, she voted with Republican senators to repeal the individual mandate of the ACA.[201] The absence of the individual mandate weakened the ACA's legal stability, leading the Trump administration in 2020 to seek to have the ACA ruled unconstitutional by the courts (in a 5–4 Supreme Court decision in 2012, Chief Justice Roberts upheld the ACA by citing the individual mandate).[202][201] The ACA remained intact, despite the lack of the individual mandate, following a 7-2 Supreme Court decision to reject a challenge to the law.[203]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Collins was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing opioid use as a nonpartisan issue that was \"ravaging communities in every state and preys upon individuals and families regardless of party affiliation\" and requesting that they \"make every effort to ensure that new, substantial and sustained funding for the opioid epidemic is included in any legislative package\".[204]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Collins cosponsored the Protecting Jessica Grubb's Legacy Act, legislation that authorized the sharing of the medical records of patients being treated for substance use disorder among healthcare providers if the patient provided the information. Cosponsor Shelley Moore Capito said the bill also prevented medical providers from unintentionally providing opioids to individuals in recovery.[205]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Collins voted against the bipartisan McCain-Kennedy comprehensive immigration reform proposal, which would have given undocumented immigrants (including those brought into the United States as minors) a pathway to citizenship if they met certain requirements, while also substantially increasing border enforcement.[206] In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act.[207] In 2013, Collins was one of 14 Republicans to vote in favor of a comprehensive immigration bill that included border security and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.[208] She opposed Obama's decision to achieve immigration reform through executive action, which gave deportation relief to as many as five million undocumented immigrants through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).[209]\n\n\nIn 2017, Collins opposed Trump's executive order to ban entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, \"The worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic.\"[210] In 2019, she introduced bipartisan legislation to oppose Trump's declaration emergency at the southern border in order to build a wall.[211] She was one of a dozen Republicans who broke with their party, joining all Democrats, to vote for the resolution rejecting the emergency declaration.[212] In September 2019, she again voted with 10 other Republicans to overturn Trump's emergency declaration on the border.[213]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Collins was one of six Republicans who voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage.[214] She voted in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and was the primary Republican sponsor of the repeal effort.[215][216][217][218][219] In 2015, she was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to give Social Security benefits to same-sex couples in states where same-sex marriage was not yet recognized.[220]\n\n\nIn 2017 and 2019, Collins co-sponsored bills with Democratic senators to prevent Trump from banning transgender people from the United States military[221] and prohibit anti-LGBT housing discrimination.[222][223][224] She was the only Republican co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which aims to comprehensively prohibit LGBT discrimination.[225] In February 2021, Collins announced she would no longer co-sponsor the bill over amendments that were not made.[226]\n\n\nIn 2021, Collins was one of 49 senators to vote for an amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which aimed to defund schools allowing transgender students to compete in sports.[227]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which rates politicians' support for LGBT issues, gave Collins a score of 85% during the 114th Congress (2015–17),[228] and a score of 33% during the 115th Congress (2017–19).[229] She received a 49% score in the 116th Congress.[230] In 2020, the HRC endorsed an opponent of Collins for the first time since 1996, citing her votes for judicial nominees, particularly Brett Kavanaugh.[231][232] In 2022, Collins was one of 12 Republicans in the Senate voting to advance and pass the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation intended to codify same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[233]\n\n\n\n### Net neutrality[edit]\n\n\nCollins strongly supports FCC Open Internet Order 2010. After former Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai repealed net neutrality regulations in 2017, Collins and Senator Angus King announced they would support a bipartisan enactment of the Congressional Review Act to reverse the FCC's decision.[234] In another statement, Collins argued that net neutrality regulations would help rural communities obtain access to the internet and that the regulations strengthened consumer privacy protections, citing the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal for failing to protect consumers' privacy.[235]\n\n\n\n### United States Postal Service[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Collins sponsored the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate unanimously. It requires the USPS to prepay 50 years' worth of employee health and retirement benefits.[236] Since the act passed, the USPS has defaulted on payments.[237][238]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group, awarded Collins the 2013 Spirit of Enterprise Award for her support of its positions.[239]\n\n\nOn May 7, 2014, *The National Journal* recognized Collins as the senator with \"perfect attendance\", noting that she had not missed a single vote since her election to the Senate in 1997.[240]\n\n\nIn 2014, *Elle* magazine named Collins one of its \"10 Most Powerful Women in D.C\".[241]\n\n\nCollins received the Publius Award from the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress on March 12, 2014.[242]\n\n\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars gave Collins its 2017 Congressional Award, which is annually given to one member of Congress for their significant legislative contributions on behalf of military veterans.[243]\n\n\nIn 2022, Collins received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award.[244][245]\n\n\n\n## Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHonorary degrees awarded to Susan Collins\n| Location\n | Date\n | School\n | Degree\n | Gave commencement address\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bangor, Maine | 1997 | Husson University | Doctor of Public Service[246][247] | No\n |\n| Biddeford, Maine | 1999 | University of New England | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[248] | Yes\n |\n| Castine, Maine | 2007 | Maine Maritime Academy | Doctorate[249][250] | Yes\n |\n| Waterville, Maine | September 13, 2014 | Colby College | Doctorate[251][252] | No\n |\n| Augusta, Maine | May 9, 2015 | University of Maine at Augusta | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[253] | Yes\n |\n| Middlebury, Vermont | May 29, 2016 | Middlebury College | Doctorate[254] | No\n |\n| Canton, New York | May 21, 2017 | St. Lawrence University | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[255] | Yes[256] |\n| Lewiston, Maine | May 28, 2017 | Bates College | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[257][258] | No[259] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(July 2020)*\n |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nCollins is married to Thomas Daffron, a lobbyist who worked as chief operating officer at Jefferson Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. from 2006 to 2016; he consulted on Collins's 1996, 2002 and 2008 Senate campaigns.[260] They were married on August 11, 2012, at the Gray Memorial United Methodist Church in Caribou, Maine.[261][262] Collins is Roman Catholic.[263]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Susan Collins\n\nCollins has been on the general-election ballot six times in Maine: once for governor, five times for U.S. senator. She has been defeated just once, in her 1994 campaign for governor.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** \"History – Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee\". *hsgac.senate.gov*.

A member of the Republican Party, she has held her seat since 1997 and is Maine's longest-serving senator.\n\n\nBorn in Caribou, Maine, Collins is a graduate of St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. Beginning her career as a staff assistant for Senator William Cohen in 1975, she became staff director of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee of the Committee on Governmental Affairs (which later became the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs)[1] in 1981. Governor John R. McKernan Jr. then appointed her commissioner of the Maine Department of Professional and Financial Regulation in 1987. In 1992 President George H. W. Bush appointed her director of the Small Business Administration's regional office in Boston. Collins became a deputy state treasurer in the office of the Treasurer and Receiver-General of Massachusetts in 1993.[2] After moving back to Maine in 1994, she became the Republican nominee for governor of Maine in the 1994 general election. She was the first female major-party nominee for the post, finishing third in a four-way race with 23% of the vote. After her bid for governor in 1994, she became the founding director of the Center for Family Business at Husson University in Bangor, Maine.\n\n\nCollins was first elected to the Senate in 1996. She was reelected in 2002, in 2008, in 2014, and in 2020. She chaired the Senate Special Committee on Aging from 2015 to 2021 and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs from 2003 to 2007. Collins is a senior Republican woman in the Senate, the dean of Maine's congressional delegation, and the only New England Republican in the 116th, 117th, and 118th Congresses.[3] As of the 118th Congress, Collins is the only Republican to represent a Northeastern state in the Senate. She has been called a moderate Republican, and is often a pivotal vote in the Senate.[4][5] To date, Collins is the longest-serving Republican woman in the Senate.[6][7]\n\n\nCollins, who has described herself as a pro-choice Republican, attracted controversy for her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She attributed her vote to her belief that Kavanaugh would not support overturning *Roe v. Wade*; in June 2022, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe*. \n\n\nDuring the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, Collins was one of 10 Republican senators to vote to acquit him on the first charge and one of five to vote to acquit on the second, and during the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Collins joined all Senate Republicans but one in voting to acquit him on the first charge, and all Republicans to acquit on the second. She was the only Republican senator to vote against confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court in 2020. On February 13, 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nOne of six children, Collins was born in Caribou, Maine, where her family operates a lumber business established by her great-great-great-grandfather, Samuel W. Collins, in 1844.[8] Her parents, Patricia (née McGuigan) and Donald Collins (1925–2018), each served as mayor of Caribou.[8] Her father, a decorated veteran of World War II, also served in the Maine Legislature, with one term in the House, and four in the Senate.[9][10]\n\n\nCollins's mother was born in Barrancabermeja, Colombia, to American parents.[11] Collins is of English and Irish ancestry. Her uncle, Samuel W. Collins Jr., sat on the Maine Supreme Judicial Court from 1988 to 1994 and served in the Maine Senate from 1973 to 1984.[12]\n\n\nCollins attended Caribou High School, where she was president of the student council.[13] During her senior year of high school in 1971, she was chosen to participate in the U.S. Senate Youth Program, through which she visited Washington, D.C., for the first time and had a two-hour conversation with Maine's first female United States Senator, Margaret Chase Smith, also a Republican. Collins is the first program delegate elected to the Senate and holds the seat once held by Smith.[13] After graduating from high school, she continued her education at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York.[14] Like her father, she was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa national academic honor society. She graduated from St. Lawrence *magna cum laude* with a bachelor's degree in government in 1975.[15]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nFollowing graduation, Collins worked as a legislative assistant to U.S. Representative and later U.S. Senator William Cohen from 1975 to 1987.[14] She was also staff director of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee on the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs from 1981 to 1987.[14]\n\n\nIn 1987, Collins joined the cabinet of Governor John R. McKernan Jr. as Commissioner of the Department of Professional and Financial Regulation.[15] President George H. W. Bush appointed her the New England regional director for the Small Business Administration in 1992.[10] After briefly serving in this post until the 1992 election of President Bill Clinton, she moved to Massachusetts and became Deputy State Treasurer of Massachusetts under Joe Malone in 1993.[14]\n\n\nReturning to Maine, Collins won an eight-way Republican primary in the 1994 gubernatorial election, becoming the first woman nominated by a major party for governor of Maine.[10] During the campaign, she received little support from Republican leaders and was criticized by conservative groups for her more liberal views on social issues. She lost the general election, receiving 23% of the vote and placing third behind Democrat Joseph E. Brennan and the winner, Independent candidate Angus King, her future Senate colleague.[16]\n\n\nIn December 1994, Collins became the founding executive director of the Richard E. Dyke Center for Family Business at Husson College.[15] She served in this post until 1996, when she announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by her former boss, William Cohen, who retired to become United States Secretary of Defense under President Clinton. With Cohen's public endorsement, she won a difficult four-way primary and faced Brennan, her opponent in the 1994 gubernatorial election, in the general election. She defeated him, 49% to 44%.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Collins with President Barack Obama\nCollins was elected to the Senate in 1996. During the campaign she pledged that, if elected, she would serve only two terms.[19]\n\n\nCollins was reelected in 2002 over State Senator Chellie Pingree, 58%–42%, in 2008 over Representative Tom Allen, 61.5%–38.5%, and in 2014 over Shenna Bellows, 68.5%–31.5%. In her first three reelection campaigns, she carried every county in Maine.[20]\n\n\nIn 2020, Collins was challenged by Democratic State House Speaker Sara Gideon. The hotly contested race became the most expensive in Maine history, with Collins spending $23 million and Gideon nearly $48 million.[21] The race also had national implications, as defeating Collins was a key part of the Democrats' strategy to achieve a Senate majority. Despite trailing Gideon in every public poll of the race,[22] Collins defeated Gideon[23] by a decisive margin.[24]\n\n\nIn 2009, Collins was called one of \"the last survivors of a once common species of moderate Northeastern Republican\".[12] She is considered a centrist Republican and an influential player in the Senate.[25][26][27]\n\n\nAlthough she shared a centrist ideology with Maine's former senator, Olympia Snowe, Collins is considered a \"half-turn more conservative\" than Snowe.[12] She was consistently endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, a major LGBT rights organization, until 2020.[28] She supported John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. She became the state's senior senator in 2013 when Snowe left the Senate and was replaced by independent Angus King, who defeated Collins in the 1994 governor election.[29]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n#### First term[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Collins played an important role during the Senate's impeachment trial of Bill Clinton when she and Snowe sponsored a motion that would have allowed the Senate to vote separately on the charges and the remedy. The motion failed, and Snowe and Collins voted to acquit, believing that while Clinton had committed perjury, that was not grounds for removal from office.[30]\n\n\nIn March 1997, the Senate adopted a broader investigation into White House and Congressional campaign fund-raising practices than Senate Republicans initially wanted. Collins said there were \"a number of allegations that may or may not be illegal, but they may be improper.\"[31]\n\n\nIn a May 1997 interview, Collins stated her support for a proposal by Tom Daschle banning all abortions after the fetus is capable of living outside the womb except to save the life of the woman or protect her from physical injury. Of an alternative measure proposed by Rick Santorum that would ban partial-birth abortion, Collins said it \"ignores cases in the medical literature involving women with very serious physical health problems\".[32]\n\n\nIn 2001 Collins authored a measure that granted the United States Secretary of Education authority to grant waivers that would relieve reservists and members of the National Guard from making federal student loan payments during active duty and grant the same privileges to victims and families of those affected by the September 11 attacks. The bill passed the Senate and House in December 2001.[33]\n\n\nIn November 2002, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Department of Homeland Security while a Democratic effort to remove the bill's provisions fell short on a 52-to-47 vote that came after President George W. Bush lobbied against the vote. Collins and other senators said that Senate and House Republicans, as well as the White House, had given them an \"ironclad promise\" to essentially rescind provisions in the first spending bill to pass Congress the following year.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Second term[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Collins was one of the primary sponsors of legislation overhauling the U.S. intelligence community by creating a new post, Director of National Intelligence, to oversee budgets and most assets of the spy agencies, and mandating that federal agencies establish minimum standards for states pertaining to issuing driver's licenses and birth certificates along with directing the United States Department of Homeland Security to form standards for ID used to board airplanes. The bill passed in the House and Senate in December. Collins said, \"This was the most difficult bill to bring from conception to birth that I can imagine being involved with. But that makes the victory doubly satisfying.\"[35] Bush signed the bill, formally known as the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, on December 17, 2004.[36]\n\n\nIn May 2005, Collins was one of 14 senators (seven Democrats and seven Republicans) to forge a compromise on the Democrats' use of the judicial filibuster, thus allowing the Republican leadership to end debate without having to exercise the nuclear option. Under the agreement, Democrats agreed they would filibuster Bush's judicial nominees only in \"extraordinary circumstances\"; three Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate; and two others, Henry Saad and William Myers, were expressly denied such protection (both eventually withdrew their names from consideration).[37][38]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Collins criticized robocalls by the McCain campaign claiming that Barack Obama \"has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans\", asserting that those \"kind of tactics have no place in Maine politics\" and urging McCain to cease the calls immediately.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Third term[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Collins was criticized for blocking flu relief funding during the swine flu pandemic. She said she had done so on procedural grounds, because the funding did not belong in a stimulus bill: \"while worthwhile, [it does] not boost our economy,\" and \"it does not make sense to include $870 million for pandemic flu preparedness.\"[40]\n\n\nIn April 2010, Collins and Senator Joe Lieberman issued a subpoena seeking documents and interviews associated with the American government's investigation into the conduct of investigators during their interactions with Nidal Hasan before the Fort Hood shooting. The Pentagon announced that the Obama administration would not authorize Senate investigators to question intelligence agents who reviewed e-mails between Hasan and an extremist Islamic cleric before the shooting. Collins and Lieberman issued a statement accusing the Departments of Justice and Defense of refusing \"to provide access to their agents who reportedly reviewed Major Hasan's communications with radical extremist cleric Anwar al Awlaki and to transcripts of prosecution interviews with Hasan's associates and superiors, which DOD already provided to its internal review.\"[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Collins, right, stands near President Barack Obama as he signs the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell\nIn May 2010, Collins and Snowe were the only two Republicans to vote for an unsuccessful Democratic measure that would have prevented bailouts, highlighted financial products of complexity and toughened consumer protection.[42]\n\n\nIn February 2013, Collins announced her opposition to the confirmation of Chuck Hagel for United States Secretary of Defense, citing her belief that Hagel's \"past positions, votes and statements [do not] match the challenges of our time.\" The announcement came as a surprise, as Collins was considered a possible supporter of his nomination, and it occurred while the nomination was being filibustered.[43] The filibuster on Hagel's nomination was defeated,[44] and he was confirmed later that month.[45]\n\n\nIn May 2013, following a report that the Internal Revenue Service had put additional scrutiny on conservative groups, Collins said the revelation \"contributes to the profound distrust that the American people have in government\" and added that she was disappointed that Obama \"hasn't personally condemned this and spoken out\".[46]\n\n\nIn April 2014, the Senate debated the Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour over two years.[47] The bill was strongly supported by Obama and many Democratic senators but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.[48][49][50] Collins tried to negotiate a compromise bill that centrist Republicans could agree to but was unable to do so.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth term[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Collins, Lamar Alexander, and Lindsey Graham meet with President Donald Trump in November 2017\nIn May 2016, the Senate passed an appropriations bill containing an amendment by Collins that she said would help prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development from gaining \"national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country\". The legislation was given a veto threat by the White House, which was said by the Office of Management and Budget to oppose \"the inclusion of problematic ideological provisions that are beyond the scope of funding legislation\".[51]\n\n\nIn 2016, Collins authored the Safe Treatments and Opportunities to Prevent Pain Act, a provision intended to encourage the National Institutes of Health to further its research into opioid therapy alternatives for pain management, and the Infant Plan of Safe Care Act, which mandated that states ensure safe care plans are developed for infants who are drug-dependent before they are discharged from hospitals. These provisions were included in the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act,[52] legislation that created programs and expanded treatment access alongside implementing $181 million in new spending as part of an attempt to curb heroin and opioid addiction. Obama signed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act into law on July 22, 2016.[53]\n\n\nOn August 8, 2016, Collins announced that she would not vote for Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election. She said that as a lifelong Republican she did not make the decision lightly but felt he was unsuitable for office, \"based on his disregard for the precept of treating others with respect, an idea that should transcend politics\".[54] She considered voting for the Libertarian Party's ticket or a write-in candidate.[55][56]\n\n\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Collins received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Washington.[57]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski voted for Trump's nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, within the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, passing DeVos's nomination by a vote of 12–11 to allow the full Senate to vote. Collins justified her vote, saying, \"Presidents are entitled to considerable deference in the selection of Cabinet members.\"[58][59][60] Later, she and Murkowski were the only Republicans to break party lines and vote against DeVos's confirmation.[61][62] This caused a 50–50 tie that was broken by Senate President Mike Pence to confirm DeVos.[63]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Collins said she could not support the American Health Care Act, the House Republicans' plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.[64] She announced she would vote against the Senate version of the Republican bill to repeal Obamacare.[65] Collins also clarified that she opposed repealing the ACA without a replacement proposal.[66] On July 26, Collins was one of seven Republicans in voting against repealing the ACA without a suitable replacement.[67] On July 27, she joined two other Republicans in voting against the \"skinny\" repeal of the ACA.[68] In October, Collins called on Trump to support a bipartisan Congressional effort led by Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray to reinstate insurer payments, saying that what Trump was doing was \"affecting people's access and the cost of health care right now\".[69]\n\n\nOn December 14, 2017, the day the FCC was set to hold a vote on net neutrality, Collins and King sent the FCC a letter asking that the vote be postponed to allow public hearings on the merits of repealing net neutrality.[70] They expressed concerns that repealing net neutrality could adversely affect the U.S. economy.[70] As part of this drive, Collins is reported to support using the authority under the Congressional Review Act to nullify the FCC's repeal vote.[71] In 2018, Collins was one of three Republicans voting with Democrats to repeal rule changes enacted by the Republican-controlled FCC.[72] The measure was meant to restore Obama-era net neutrality rules.[73]\n\n\nIn 2017, The Lugar Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit founded by Senator Richard Lugar, released a bipartisan index in cooperation with Georgetown University that ranked Collins the most bipartisan senator during the first session of the 115th Congress (and the only U.S. Senator from the Northeast ranked among the top 10 most bipartisan senators).[74][75]\n\n\nIn January 2018, in response to the Trump administration's not implementing congressionally approved sanctions on Russia, Collins said it was confirmed Russia had tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, adding, \"not only should there be a price to pay in terms of sanctions, but also we need to put safeguards in place right now for the elections for this year.\" She noted that the legislation received bipartisan support and predicted Russia would also attempt to interfere in the 2018 elections.[76] In January 2019, Collins was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to block Trump from lifting sanctions on three Russian companies. She said she disagreed with \"the easing of the sanctions because I think it sends the wrong message to Russia and to the oligarch and close ally of Mr. Putin, Oleg Deripaska, who will in my judgment continue to maintain considerable [ownership] under the Treasury's plan.\"[77]\n\n\nIn 2018, Collins and Senators Tim Kaine, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Shelley Moore Capito authored the Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, legislation centered on providing a public health approach to Alzheimer's. The bill would authorize $20 million annually to establish the \"Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Public Health Centers of Excellence\" and aid statewide efforts to promote brain health and reduce cognitive decline. It passed the Senate and House and was signed by Trump in January 2019.[78]\n\n\nIn September 2018, Collins authored two bills as part of the Opioid Crisis Response Act, a bipartisan package of 70 Senate bills that would alter programs across multiple agencies in an effort to prevent opioids from being shipped through the U.S. Postal Service and grant doctors the ability to prescribe medications designed to wean opioid addictions. The bills passed 99 to 1.[79][80]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Collins was one of five senators to sponsor legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to mint coins honoring George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush under the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005[81] and introduced the Reviving America's Scenic Byways Act of 2019 along with Ben Cardin. The bill required the Secretary of Transportation to request nominations and make determinations in regard to roads that would be designed under a voluntary, community-based program and was signed into law by Trump in September of that year.[82] After the Senate Intelligence Committee held a closed-door meeting with Michael Cohen, Collins said senators \"clearly need to re-interview some witnesses whose accounts [Cohen] contradicts\". Her comment was seen as hinting at the Intelligence Committee's interest in speaking with Donald Trump Jr. again.[83] In June, Collins cosponsored an amendment to form the John S. McCain III Human Rights Commission, which would hold hearings and briefings on human rights violations ahead of collaborations with the Trump administration to address the violations, and be included in a defense authorization bill McCain had helped create as Armed Services Committee chairman.[84]\n\n\nIn her May 2019 commencement speech at Maine Maritime Academy, Collins said getting the Senate to approve funding for a new training ship for the academy was her \"number one priority\" and that funding was included in Trump's proposed budget while she would still seek further funds through other measures.[85]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Collins cosponsored the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act, a bill introduced by Ben Cardin and Rob Portman that would create a new, privately funded memorial that would be constructed on federal lands in Washington, D.C. in order to honor journalists, photographers, and broadcasters who died in the line of duty. Collins called freedom of the press \"one of our fundamental constitutional rights\" and spoke of the risks of reprisals faced by reporters around the world for their work.[86]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Collins voted \"not guilty\" on both articles in the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump.[87]\n\n\nOn October 26, 2020, Collins was the only Republican senator to vote against the confirmation of Trump's nominee Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 52–48.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Fifth term[edit]\n\n\nCollins giving her 2021 United States Electoral College vote count speech after the January 6 United States Capitol attack.\nOn January 6, 2021, Collins was participating in the certification of the Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. She was on the Senate floor listening to speeches related to the objection to counting Arizona's votes when the Sergeant at Arms of the U.S. Senate and U.S. Capitol Police removed Vice President Mike Pence and Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. She called the experience \"frightening and appalling.\"[89] Collins later called the attack \"a dangerous, shameful, and outrageous attack on our democracy\" and blamed Trump for \"working up the crowd and inciting this mob\". She called on him to call off the rioters. When Congress reconvened after the Capitol was secure, Collins voted to certify the count.[90]\n\n\nToward the end of January 2021, Collins led a group of 10 Republican senators who requested that President Joe Biden join bipartisan negotiations when creating his COVID-19 economic relief package.[91] After meeting with the group, Biden opted to pass his relief package using the reconciliation process, for which he did not need Republican support.[92]\n\n\nOn February 13, 2021, Collins was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial.[93]\n\n\nPolitical analysis website FiveThirtyEight found that Collins had voted in line with President Joe Biden around 67% of the time in the 117th Congress.[94]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2021, Axios[95] revealed the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation of defense contractor Martin Kao, former CEO of Navatek,[96][97] who funneled $150,000 to a pro-Collins super PAC, 1820PAC, via a shell LLC, Society for Young Women Scientists and Engineers, as a federal contractor, and reimbursed donations to the Collins 2020 campaign, both of which are illegal. A spokesperson said that the campaign had no knowledge of the exchange.[98][99]\n\n\nCollins cast her 8,000th consecutive roll call vote on October 28, 2021; only Chuck Grassley and William Proxmire have set longer streaks.[100]\n\n\nCollins voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, making her one of the only three GOP senators to support her nomination, the other two being Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney.[101]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nCollins's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[102]\n\n\n\n* **Committee on Appropriations (Vice Chair)**\n\t+ As Vice Chair, Collins is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees. Nevertheless, she also serves as vice chair of the Subcommittee on Defense in an individual capacity.\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Select Committee on Intelligence\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Afterschool Caucuses[103]\n* Republican Main Street Partnership[104]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Susan Collins\n\n![](image)With former U.S. Senator Olympia Snowe (also R-ME)\nCollins has been described as a moderate Republican and a centrist,[105][106] having voted with her party 59% of the time from 1997 to 2016. She voted with her party more often, about 87% of the time, in 2017, at the beginning of the Trump administration.[107][108][109]\n\n\nIn 2013, Collins sided with Obama's position 75.9% of the time, one of only two Republicans to vote with him more than 70% of the time.[110] As of January 2021, according to *FiveThirtyEight*, she had voted with Trump's positions about 65% of the time, the lowest among all Republican senators.[111] During Trump's presidency she voted with the Republican majority on party-line votes much more often than during Obama's presidency.[107] According to FiveThirtyEight, as of October 2022, she has voted with Biden's position about 69.1% of the time.[112]\n\n\nCollins voted to acquit Trump of all charges at his first impeachment trial.[113] She said she did not think Trump's request that the Ukrainian President announce an investigation into Joe Biden met the \"high bar\" for \"removing a duly elected president\".[114] She said Trump had \"learned from this case\" and \"will be much more cautious in the future.\"[114] Shortly after his acquittal, Trump fired witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.[115][116] In the following months, he fired inspectors general of the State Department and the intelligence community. Collins criticized the firing, provoking a retaliatory response from Trump.[117]\n\n\nOn February 13, 2021, Collins was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial.[118] On May 27, 2021, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, she voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack. She had amended the bill in the hopes of drawing sufficient Republicans to support it, but the vote failed for lack of 60 required \"yes\" votes to prevent a filibuster.[119]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nCollins is one of two Republican U.S. Senators, along with Lisa Murkowski, who describe themselves as pro-choice, or pro-abortion rights, and supported *Roe v. Wade*.[120][121][122]\n\n\nAccording to *HuffPost*, Collins has repeatedly voted to confirm judges who have signaled opposition to abortion rights. She has defended these votes by citing her support for both of Obama's Supreme Court appointments.[123] She voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying she did not believe he would overturn *Roe*.[124][125] She said she felt \"vindication\" in 2018 when Kavanaugh voted with the court's four Democratic-appointed justices and Chief Justice John Roberts not to hear cases against Planned Parenthood from Kansas and Louisiana, although Planned Parenthood disagreed with her assessment of the situation.[126][127] In 2020, Collins faced renewed criticism of her vote by progressive groups when Kavanaugh said states should be permitted to severely reduce access to and availability of abortion in his dissent in *June Medical Services LLC v Russo*.[128][129]\n\n\nIn 2021, Collins was one of three Republican senators to decline to sign an *amicus* brief supporting an anti-abortion Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.[130] She faced renewed criticism after Kavanaugh voted with the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject an emergency petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; the law went into effect while facing continued challenges in the courts.[131] Responding to the legislation and criticism, Collins denounced the Texas anti-abortion law as \"extreme, inhumane, and unconstitutional\" and said she supports the *Roe* precedent as the \"law of the land\".[132]\n\n\nIn 2022, Collins received additional criticism for her support of Kavanaugh after a leaked draft of the Supreme Court opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization indicated the Court would overturn *Roe v. Wade*, with Kavanaugh breaking with his statements that *Roe* was \"settled law\".[133][134][135][136] She has also received criticism for calling the police in reaction to chalk protests due to her votes to confirm justices involved in the draft ruling.[137][138][139][140]\n\n\nOn May 11, 2022, Collins voted against the Women's Health Protection Act of 2022, a bill that would prohibit a variety of restrictions on access to abortion, on the basis that it went too far beyond the standards established in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[141][142] Collins joined Murkowski and Senator Kyrsten Sinema in drafting the Reproductive Choice Act, alternative legislation that would codify *Roe* and *Casey* into federal law more narrowly.[141][143][144]\n\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Collins expressed concerns about how the Bush administration wanted to implement its proposed plan to cut taxes.[145] She cited deficit concerns as a reason for opposing the plan,[145] but ultimately voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts in 2003 and for their extension in 2006.[146][147][148] Collins was one of just three Republican lawmakers to vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,[149] prompting heated criticism from the right for crossing party lines.\n\n\nIn December 2017, Collins voted to pass the 2017 Republican tax plan.[150] The bill greatly reduces corporate taxes while reducing taxes for some individuals and increasing them for others by removing some popular deductions.[150] The bill also repeals Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, leaving thirteen million Americans uninsured and raising premiums by an estimated additional 10% per year.[151][152] After the vote, Collins said she received assurances from congressional leaders that they would pass legislation intended to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the individual mandate's repeal.[152] When asked how she could vote for a bill that would increase the deficit by an estimated $1 trillion (over ten years) after having railed against the deficit during the Obama administration, Collins insisted that it would not increase the deficit. She said she had been advised in this determination by economists Glenn Hubbard, Larry Lindsey, and Douglas Holtz-Eakin.[153][150] Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote that Hubbard and Holtz-Eakin denied saying the plan would not increase the deficit.[154][155]\n\n\nAfter voting for the tax plan, Collins became the top recipient of political donations from private equity firms.[156] Blackstone chief executive Steven Schwarzman donated $2 million to Collins's PAC, and Ken Griffin of the hedge fund Citadel donated $1.5 million.[156]\n\n\nAlong with all other Senate and House Republicans, Collins voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[157] On September 30, 2021, she was one of 15 Senate Republicans to join all Democrats and both Independents to approve a temporary spending bill to continue government funding and avoid a government shutdown.[158][159] On October 7, 2021, she voted with 10 other Republicans and all members of the Democratic caucus to break the filibuster on raising the debt ceiling.[160][161] She voted with all Republicans against the legislation to raise the debt ceiling.[162]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Collins joined the bipartisan Gang of 20, which sought to break a deadlock on a bill allowing offshore drilling that would devote billions in proceeds to renewable energy development.[163][164]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Collins was the only Republican to vote against undoing an Obama administration rule that required coal mining companies to avoid contaminating local waterways.[165] She was the only Republican to vote against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, and later Andrew Wheeler, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.[166][167]\n\n\nIn 2017, Collins voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, allowing oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, after unsuccessfully attempting to remove that part of the bill.[168][*better source needed*]\n\n\nAs of 2022, Collins has a lifetime score of 60% from the League of Conservation Voters, the highest of any incumbent Senate Republican.[169]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy and national security[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Collins voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution authorizing President Bush to go to war against Iraq.[170] In November 2007, she was one of four Republicans to vote for a Democratic proposal of $50 billion that would condition further spending on a timeline for withdrawing troops, mandating that a withdrawal begin 30 days after the bill was enacted as part of a goal of removing all U.S. troops in Iraq by December 15, 2008. The bill failed to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster.[171] In April 2008, Collins and Senators Ben Nelson and Evan Bayh met with Bush's advisor on Iraq and Afghanistan, Douglas Lute, and expressed support for a prohibition on spending for major reconstruction projects, the proposal requiring Iraqis to pay for its security forces to be trained and equipped and reimburse the American military for the estimated $153 million a month the military spent on fueling in combat operations in Iraq. Collins said after the meeting that while the administration did not have a view entirely similar to the senators', it at least seemed open to their proposal.[172] In June 2014, while growing violence erupted in Iraq under the leadership of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, Collins said the violence would have been slower had a residual NATO force been present in Iraq and that the question was whether airstrikes were effective.[173]\n\n\nIn September 2009, Collins said she was unsure whether sending more American troops to Afghanistan would help end the Afghanistan War, but cited the need for \"more American civilians to help build up institutions\" and growth of the Afghan army.[174] In 2010, she called for the removal of Arnold Fields as Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, citing his repeated expressing of concern for the SIGAR and his disappointment with the Obama administration's \"ongoing failure to take decisive action\".[175] In August 2017, Collins commended Trump for providing clarity after years of the U.S. lacking a \"clear focus and defined strategy\" with respect to Afghanistan and said he made the case that the Afghan government must participate \"in defending its people, ending havens for terrorists, and curtailing corruption\".[176]\n\n\nBefore Obama met President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping at an informal retreat in June 2013, Collins cosponsored legislation that would authorize the Commerce Department to investigate whether currency manipulation is a form of subsidization.[177] In April 2018, she said the U.S. needed \"a more nuanced approach\" in dealing with China but gave Trump \"credit for levying these tariffs against the Chinese, with whom we've talked for a decade about their unfair trade practices and their theft of intellectual property from American firms\", adding that while the U.S. needed to toughen its stance against China, it would need to do this in a manner that did not create \"a trade war and retaliation that will end up with our European and Asian competitors getting business that otherwise would have come to American farmers\".[178]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Collins was one of seven Senate Republicans not to sign a March 2015 letter to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran attempting to cast doubt on the Obama administration's authority to engage in nuclear-proliferation negotiations with Iran.[179] She announced her opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement later that year, saying it was \"fundamentally flawed because it leaves Iran as capable of building a nuclear weapon at the expiration of the agreement as it is today\", and predicted Iran \"will be a more dangerous and stronger nuclear threshold state\" after the agreement expires.[180] In June 2019, after the United States nearly launched an airstrike on Iran after Iran downed an American surveillance drone, Collins said the U.S. could not \"allow Iran to continue to launch this kind of attack\" but warned that miscalculations by either side \"could lead to a war in the Middle East\".[181]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Collins co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[182] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[183]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Collins was one of five Republican senators to vote against tabling a resolution that would cease the U.S. military's support for Saudi Arabia's bombing operations in Yemen.[184] In December, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote for the resolution withdrawing American armed forces' support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and an amendment by Todd Young ensuring midair refueling between American and Saudi Air Force did not resume.[185] Collins was one of seven Republicans to vote to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen in February 2019, and, in May 2019, she was one of seven Republicans to vote to override Trump's veto of the resolution on Yemen.[186] In June 2019, Collins was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump's Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales.[187]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Collins voted to confirm U.S. Representative John Ratcliffe as Director of National Intelligence. In 2019, there was bipartisan opposition to Ratcliffe's nomination. *The Washington Post* called Collins's support for Ratcliffe \"key\" to his 2020 confirmation.[188]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nCollins voted for the Manchin–Toomey bill to amend federal law to expand background checks for gun purchases.[189] She voted against a ban on high-capacity (more than ten rounds) magazines.[190] In 2014 she received a \"C\" grade on gun rights from the NRA Political Victory Fund,[191] rising to a \"B\" rating in 2020.[192] She received a D− from Gun Owners of America in 2012.[193]\n\n\nIn 2018, Collins co-sponsored the NICS Denial Notification Act,[194] legislation developed in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that would require federal authorities to inform states within a day after a person failing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System attempted to buy a firearm.[195]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Collins supported the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act, legislation enabling the attorney general to deny the sale of a firearm to people on the no-fly list or selectee list. It passed the House but failed to advance in the Senate.[196]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gun Owners of Maine gave Collins a B rating, writing, \"On 2nd Amendment issues, Susan Collins generally stands with gun owners. She has opposed magazine capacity restrictions and voted to prohibit lawsuits against gun manufacturers for crimes committed with guns.\"[197]\n\n\nIn 2022, Collins became one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which included a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases.[198]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Collins was one of six senators to introduce the Medicaid Coverage for Addiction Recovery Expansion Act, legislation that would allow treatment facilities with up to 40 beds reimbursement by Medicaid for 60 consecutive days of inpatient services and serve as a modification of the Medicaid Institutions for Mental Disease law, which authorized Medicaid coverage only for facilities with 16 or fewer beds.[199]\n\n\nThough she voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Collins (along with fellow Republicans John McCain and Lisa Murkowski) voted against an unsuccessful \"skinny repeal\" attempt in July 2017.[200] Later that year, she voted with Republican senators to repeal the individual mandate of the ACA.[201] The absence of the individual mandate weakened the ACA's legal stability, leading the Trump administration in 2020 to seek to have the ACA ruled unconstitutional by the courts (in a 5–4 Supreme Court decision in 2012, Chief Justice Roberts upheld the ACA by citing the individual mandate).[202][201] The ACA remained intact, despite the lack of the individual mandate, following a 7-2 Supreme Court decision to reject a challenge to the law.[203]\n\n\nIn December 2017, Collins was one of nine senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer describing opioid use as a nonpartisan issue that was \"ravaging communities in every state and preys upon individuals and families regardless of party affiliation\" and requesting that they \"make every effort to ensure that new, substantial and sustained funding for the opioid epidemic is included in any legislative package\".[204]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Collins cosponsored the Protecting Jessica Grubb's Legacy Act, legislation that authorized the sharing of the medical records of patients being treated for substance use disorder among healthcare providers if the patient provided the information. Cosponsor Shelley Moore Capito said the bill also prevented medical providers from unintentionally providing opioids to individuals in recovery.[205]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Collins voted against the bipartisan McCain-Kennedy comprehensive immigration reform proposal, which would have given undocumented immigrants (including those brought into the United States as minors) a pathway to citizenship if they met certain requirements, while also substantially increasing border enforcement.[206] In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act.[207] In 2013, Collins was one of 14 Republicans to vote in favor of a comprehensive immigration bill that included border security and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.[208] She opposed Obama's decision to achieve immigration reform through executive action, which gave deportation relief to as many as five million undocumented immigrants through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).[209]\n\n\nIn 2017, Collins opposed Trump's executive order to ban entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, \"The worldwide refugee ban set forth in the executive order is overly broad and implementing it will be immediately problematic.\"[210] In 2019, she introduced bipartisan legislation to oppose Trump's declaration emergency at the southern border in order to build a wall.[211] She was one of a dozen Republicans who broke with their party, joining all Democrats, to vote for the resolution rejecting the emergency declaration.[212] In September 2019, she again voted with 10 other Republicans to overturn Trump's emergency declaration on the border.[213]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Collins was one of six Republicans who voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would ban same-sex marriage.[214] She voted in favor of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 and was the primary Republican sponsor of the repeal effort.[215][216][217][218][219] In 2015, she was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to give Social Security benefits to same-sex couples in states where same-sex marriage was not yet recognized.[220]\n\n\nIn 2017 and 2019, Collins co-sponsored bills with Democratic senators to prevent Trump from banning transgender people from the United States military[221] and prohibit anti-LGBT housing discrimination.[222][223][224] She was the only Republican co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which aims to comprehensively prohibit LGBT discrimination.[225] In February 2021, Collins announced she would no longer co-sponsor the bill over amendments that were not made.[226]\n\n\nIn 2021, Collins was one of 49 senators to vote for an amendment to the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, which aimed to defund schools allowing transgender students to compete in sports.[227]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign (HRC), which rates politicians' support for LGBT issues, gave Collins a score of 85% during the 114th Congress (2015–17),[228] and a score of 33% during the 115th Congress (2017–19).[229] She received a 49% score in the 116th Congress.[230] In 2020, the HRC endorsed an opponent of Collins for the first time since 1996, citing her votes for judicial nominees, particularly Brett Kavanaugh.[231][232] In 2022, Collins was one of 12 Republicans in the Senate voting to advance and pass the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation intended to codify same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[233]\n\n\n\n### Net neutrality[edit]\n\n\nCollins strongly supports FCC Open Internet Order 2010. After former Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai repealed net neutrality regulations in 2017, Collins and Senator Angus King announced they would support a bipartisan enactment of the Congressional Review Act to reverse the FCC's decision.[234] In another statement, Collins argued that net neutrality regulations would help rural communities obtain access to the internet and that the regulations strengthened consumer privacy protections, citing the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal for failing to protect consumers' privacy.[235]\n\n\n\n### United States Postal Service[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Collins sponsored the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, which passed the Senate unanimously. It requires the USPS to prepay 50 years' worth of employee health and retirement benefits.[236] Since the act passed, the USPS has defaulted on payments.[237][238]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a lobbying group, awarded Collins the 2013 Spirit of Enterprise Award for her support of its positions.[239]\n\n\nOn May 7, 2014, *The National Journal* recognized Collins as the senator with \"perfect attendance\", noting that she had not missed a single vote since her election to the Senate in 1997.[240]\n\n\nIn 2014, *Elle* magazine named Collins one of its \"10 Most Powerful Women in D.C\".[241]\n\n\nCollins received the Publius Award from the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress on March 12, 2014.[242]\n\n\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars gave Collins its 2017 Congressional Award, which is annually given to one member of Congress for their significant legislative contributions on behalf of military veterans.[243]\n\n\nIn 2022, Collins received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award.[244][245]\n\n\n\n## Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHonorary degrees awarded to Susan Collins\n| Location\n | Date\n | School\n | Degree\n | Gave commencement address\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Bangor, Maine | 1997 | Husson University | Doctor of Public Service[246][247] | No\n |\n| Biddeford, Maine | 1999 | University of New England | Doctor of Laws (LL.D.)[248] | Yes\n |\n| Castine, Maine | 2007 | Maine Maritime Academy | Doctorate[249][250] | Yes\n |\n| Waterville, Maine | September 13, 2014 | Colby College | Doctorate[251][252] | No\n |\n| Augusta, Maine | May 9, 2015 | University of Maine at Augusta | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[253] | Yes\n |\n| Middlebury, Vermont | May 29, 2016 | Middlebury College | Doctorate[254] | No\n |\n| Canton, New York | May 21, 2017 | St. Lawrence University | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[255] | Yes[256] |\n| Lewiston, Maine | May 28, 2017 | Bates College | Doctor of Humane Letters (DHL)[257][258] | No[259] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(July 2020)*\n |\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nCollins is married to Thomas Daffron, a lobbyist who worked as chief operating officer at Jefferson Consulting Group in Washington, D.C. from 2006 to 2016; he consulted on Collins's 1996, 2002 and 2008 Senate campaigns.[260] They were married on August 11, 2012, at the Gray Memorial United Methodist Church in Caribou, Maine.[261][262] Collins is Roman Catholic.[263]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Susan Collins\n\nCollins has been on the general-election ballot six times in Maine: once for governor, five times for U.S. senator. She has been defeated just once, in her 1994 campaign for governor.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** \"History – Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee\". *hsgac.senate.gov*.

She is the first woman to represent Alaska in the Senate and the Senate's second-most senior Republican woman, after Susan Collins of Maine. She became dean of Alaska's congressional delegation upon Representative Don Young's death.\n\n\nMurkowski is the daughter of former U.S. senator and governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski. Before her appointment to the Senate, she served in the Alaska House of Representatives and was elected majority leader. She was controversially appointed to the Senate by her father, who resigned his seat in December 2002 to become governor of Alaska. She completed her father's unexpired Senate term, which ended in January 2005, and became the first Alaskan-born member of Congress.\n\n\nMurkowski ran for and won a full term in 2004. After losing the 2010 Republican primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller, she ran as a write-in candidate and defeated both Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in the general election. She is the second U.S. senator (after Strom Thurmond in 1954) to be elected by write-in vote. She was elected to a third term in 2016 and a fourth term in 2022, running as a Republican.\n\n\nMurkowski was vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference from 2009 to 2010, chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee from 2015 to 2021, and has been vice chair of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee since 2021.\n\n\nShe is often described as one of the Senate's most moderate Republicans, and a crucial swing vote. According to *CQ Roll Call*, she voted with President Barack Obama's position 72.3% of the time in 2013, one of only two Republicans to do so over 70% of the time. In recent years, she opposed Brett Kavanaugh and supported Ketanji Brown Jackson in their respective nominations to the Supreme Court. On February 13, 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial, for which she was censured by the Alaska Republican Party.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early career[edit]\n\n\nMurkowski was born in Ketchikan in the Territory of Alaska, the daughter of Nancy Rena (née Gore) and Frank Murkowski.[1] Her paternal great-grandfather was of Polish descent, and her mother's ancestry is Irish and French Canadian.[2] As a child, she and her family moved around the state with her father's job as a banker.\n\n\nShe earned a B.A. degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1980, the same year her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. She is a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority[3] and represented Alaska as the 1980 Cherry Blossom Princess.[4] She received her J.D. degree in 1985 from Willamette University College of Law.[5]\n\n\nMurkowski worked as an attorney in the Anchorage District Court Clerk's office from 1987 to 1989.[6] From 1989 to 1998, she was an attorney in private practice in Anchorage. She served on the Mayor's Task Force for the Homeless from 1990 to 1991.[7]\n\n\n\n## Alaska House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Murkowski was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives. Her District 18 included northeast Anchorage, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base (now Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, or JBER), and suburban parts of Eagle River-Chugiak. In 1999, she introduced legislation establishing a Joint Armed Services Committee. She was reelected in 2000 and, after her district boundaries changed, in 2002. That year she had a conservative primary opponent, Nancy Dahlstrom, who challenged her because Murkowski supported abortion rights and rejected conservative economics. Murkowski prevailed by 56 votes.[8][9] She was named as House Majority Leader for the 2003–04 legislative session. She resigned her House seat before taking office, due to her appointment by her father to the seat he had vacated in the U.S. Senate, upon his stepping down to assume the Alaska governorship.[10] Murkowski sat on the Alaska Commission on Post Secondary Education and chaired both the Labor and Commerce and the Military and Veterans Affairs Committees. After she resigned to join the U.S. Senate, her father appointed Dahlstrom, the District Republican committee's choice, as her replacement.[9]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2002, Murkowski—while a member of the state House—was appointed by her father, Governor Frank Murkowski, to fill his own U.S. Senate seat made vacant when he resigned from the Senate after being elected governor.\n\n\nThe appointment caused controversy in Alaska. Many voters disapproved of the nepotism. Her appointment eventually resulted in a referendum that stripped the governor of his power to directly appoint replacement senators.[11] Along with others eligible to be considered, future Alaska governor Sarah Palin interviewed unsuccessfully for the seat.[8]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Murkowski in 2005\nMurkowski has had several close challenges but has never lost an election. She has won four full terms to the Senate; she won 48.6% of the vote in 2004, 39.5% in 2010, 44.4% in 2016 and 53.7% in 2022.[12]\n\n\n\n#### 2004[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2004 United States Senate election in Alaska\n\nMurkowski ran for a full Senate term against former Governor Tony Knowles in the 2004 election after winning a primary challenge by a large margin. She was considered vulnerable due to the controversy over her appointment, and polling showed the race was very close. The centrist Republican Main Street Partnership, which wanted to run TV ads for Murkowski, was told no airtime was left to buy.[13] Near the end of the campaign, senior U.S. Senator Ted Stevens shot ads for Murkowski and claimed that if a Democrat replaced Murkowski, Alaska would likely receive fewer federal dollars.[*citation needed*] Murkowski defeated Knowles by a narrow margin.\n\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2010 United States Senate election in Alaska and Miller v. Campbell\n\nMurkowski faced the most difficult election of her career in the August 24, 2010, Republican Party primary election against Joe Miller, a former U.S. magistrate judge[14] supported by former Governor Sarah Palin.[15][16] The initial results showed her trailing Miller, 51–49%, with absentee ballots yet to be tallied.[17] After the first round of absentee ballots were counted on August 31, Murkowski conceded, saying that she did not believe that Miller's lead could be overcome in the next round of absentee vote counting.[18][19]\n\n\nAfter the primary, the Murkowski campaign floated the idea of her running as a Libertarian in the general election.[20] But on August 29, 2010, the state Libertarian Party executive board voted not to consider Murkowski as its Senate nominee.[21]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2010, Murkowski said that she would mount a write-in campaign for the Senate seat.[22] Her campaign was aided in large part by substantial monetary assistance from Native corporations and PACs, as well as state teachers' and firefighters' unions.[23]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Murkowski had become only the second Senate candidate (after Strom Thurmond in 1954) to win a write-in campaign, thereby retaining her seat.[24][25] She emerged victorious after a two-week count of write-in ballots showed she had overtaken Miller.[26][27] Miller did not concede.[27] U.S. Federal District Judge Ralph Beistline granted an injunction to stop the certification of the election due to \"serious\" legal issues and irregularities Miller raised about the hand count of absentee ballots.[28] On December 10, 2010, an Alaskan judge dismissed Miller's case, clearing the way for Murkowski,[29] but on December 13, Miller appealed the Alaska Superior Court decision of the previous week to the Alaska Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court rejected Miller's appeal on December 22.[30] On December 28, U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline dismissed Miller's lawsuit. Governor Sean Parnell certified Murkowski as the winner on December 30.[31]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2016 United States Senate election in Alaska\n\nAfter securing the Republican Party nomination by a wide margin, Murkowski was again reelected to the Senate in 2016. Joe Miller, this time the Libertarian Party nominee, was again the runner-up.\n\n\nThe election was unusual in featuring a Libertarian Party nominee who endorsed the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, running against a Republican incumbent who did not.[32] The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld, endorsed Murkowski, citing Miller's support for Trump and \"devoted social conservative\" views as incompatible with libertarianism.\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Alaska\n\nIn 2017, Murkowski filed to run for a fourth term in 2022.[33] Due to her opposition to some of his initiatives and her vote to convict him during his second impeachment trial, former President Donald Trump pledged in June 2020 to campaign against Murkowski, implicitly endorsing a primary challenge in the process.[34][35] Of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump, Murkowski was the only one up for reelection in 2022. After the second impeachment trial, Alaska's GOP had censured her and demanded her resignation.[35] Despite Trump's pledge, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Republican senators' commitment to back Murkowski's 2022 campaign.[36]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Trump endorsed former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka for the Senate in 2022, calling her \"MAGA all the way\".[37] Murkowski later called Tshibaka \"apparently...someone with a pulse\",[38] referencing Trump's previous statement that \"if [any 2022 Murkowski challenger has] a pulse, [he is] with [them]\".[39] On July 10, 2021, the Alaska Republican Party endorsed Tshibaka.[40] Murkowski won reelection by beating Tshibaka in ranked-choice voting.[41] Murkowski's votes amounted to 53.7% after the ranked-choice tabulation.[42]\n\n\n\n### Tenure and political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Lisa Murkowski\n\nMurkowski is considered a moderate Republican.[43][44] Since she was reelected in 2010, some have deemed her voting record \"more moderate\" than that of her previous years in the Senate.[45] In 2013, the *National Journal* gave Murkowski a composite score of 56% conservative and 45% liberal[46] and ranked her the 56th most liberal and 44th most conservative member of the Senate.[47]\n\n\nAccording to GovTrack, Murkowski is the second most liberal Republican senator and, as of 2017[update], is placed by GovTrack's analysis to the left of all Republicans except Susan Collins, and to the left of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.[48] *The New York Times* arranged Republican senators by ideology and also ranked Murkowski the second most liberal Republican.[49][50] According to FiveThirtyEight, which tracks congressional votes, she voted with Trump's position approximately 72.6% of the time as of January 2021[update].[51] According to FiveThirtyEight, as of October 2022, Murkowski has voted with Biden's position about 67% of the time.[52] According to *CQ Roll Call*, Murkowski voted with President Barack Obama's position 72.3% of the time in 2013, one of only two Republicans voting for his positions over 70% of the time.[53] According to the American Conservative Union's Center for Legislative Accountability, Murkowski has a lifetime conservative score of 56.72.[54] The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave her a score of 10% in 2019.[55]\n\n\nIn 2018, she voted \"present\" on the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States as a favor to Senator Steve Daines, who was unable to attend the vote because his daughter's wedding took place that day.[56] In 2020, she voted against procedural motions to accelerate Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to that court, though she later voted to confirm Barrett.[57] On April 7, 2022, she voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, with only two other Republicans joining her: Mitt Romney and Susan Collins.[58]\n\n\nIn a March 2019 op-ed for *The Washington Post*, Murkowski and Joe Manchin wrote that climate change debate in Congress was depicted as \"an issue with just two sides—those who support drastic, unattainable measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and those who want to do nothing\" and affirmed their support for \"adopting reasonable policies that maintain that edge, build on and accelerate current efforts, and ensure a robust innovation ecosystem.\"[59]\n\n\nIn December 2020, during his lame-duck period, Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.[60] The veto left new Coast Guard cutters that were scheduled to be homeported in Alaska without port facilities to maintain them.[60] Murkowski issued a press release that said, in part, \"It’s incredible that the President chose to veto the annual National Defense Authorization Act, particularly because his reason for doing so is an issue not related to national defense.\"[60]\n\n\nAfter Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, Murkowski said Trump should resign for inciting the insurrection. With this call for his resignation, she became the first Republican in the Senate to say that Trump should leave office before the inauguration of Joe Biden. When asked whether she would remain a Republican, she replied, \"if the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me\",[61] but added, \"I have absolutely no desire to move over to the Democratic side of the aisle. I can't be somebody that I'm not.\"[62] On May 27, 2021, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, Murkowski voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack. The vote failed for lack of 60 required \"yes\" votes.[63] She was one of seven Republican senators to vote on February 13, 2021, to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. That vote failed for lack of a two-thirds majority.[64]\n\n\nMurkowski, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[65] On September 30, 2021, she was among the 15 Senate Republicans to vote with all Democrats and both Independents for a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.[66][67] On October 7, 2021, Murkowski voted with 10 other Republicans and all members of the Democratic caucus to break the filibuster of raising the debt ceiling.[68][69] However, she voted with all Republicans against the bill to raise the debt ceiling.[70] On February 5, 2022, Murkowski joined Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in condemning the Republican National Committee's censure of Representatives Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for supporting and participating in the Select Committee of the U.S. House that was tasked with investigating the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[71] The RNC contended that the Capitol riot was \"legitimate political discourse.\"[71] During her 2022 reelection campaign, Murkowski was supported by Democratic colleagues, including Jeanne Shaheen, and Independent Senator Angus King.[72]\n\n\nMurkowski supports the Equal Rights Amendment.[73]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Murkowski supports ConocoPhillips's controversial Willow oil drilling project on North Slope Borough, Alaska.[74]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Legislative Branch\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n* Committee on Indian Affairs (Vice Chair)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Senate Oceans Caucus (co-chairwoman)\n* Senate Cultural Caucus\n* Afterschool Caucuses[75]\n* Senate Republican Conference\n* Senate Arctic Caucus (chairwoman)\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, Republican primary results, 1998[76]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski**  | **830**  | **65.6%**  |\n|  | Republican | Mike Miller\n | 436\n | 34.4%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,266**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, election results, 1998[77]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski**  | **2,676**  | **96.5%**  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 96\n | 3.5%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **2,772**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, Republican primary results, 2000[78]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski (incumbent)**  | **368**  | **100%**  |\n| Total votes\n | **368**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, election results, 2000[79]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski (incumbent)**  | **3,828**  | **96.40%**  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 145\n | 3.6%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **3,973**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 18, Republican primary results, 2002[80]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski**  | **486**  | **53.1%**  |\n|  | Republican | Nancy A.

She is the first woman to represent Alaska in the Senate and the Senate's second-most senior Republican woman, after Susan Collins of Maine. She became dean of Alaska's congressional delegation upon Representative Don Young's death.\n\n\nMurkowski is the daughter of former U.S. senator and governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski. Before her appointment to the Senate, she served in the Alaska House of Representatives and was elected majority leader. She was controversially appointed to the Senate by her father, who resigned his seat in December 2002 to become governor of Alaska. She completed her father's unexpired Senate term, which ended in January 2005, and became the first Alaskan-born member of Congress.\n\n\nMurkowski ran for and won a full term in 2004. After losing the 2010 Republican primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller, she ran as a write-in candidate and defeated both Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in the general election. She is the second U.S. senator (after Strom Thurmond in 1954) to be elected by write-in vote. She was elected to a third term in 2016 and a fourth term in 2022, running as a Republican.\n\n\nMurkowski was vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference from 2009 to 2010, chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee from 2015 to 2021, and has been vice chair of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee since 2021.\n\n\nShe is often described as one of the Senate's most moderate Republicans, and a crucial swing vote. According to *CQ Roll Call*, she voted with President Barack Obama's position 72.3% of the time in 2013, one of only two Republicans to do so over 70% of the time. In recent years, she opposed Brett Kavanaugh and supported Ketanji Brown Jackson in their respective nominations to the Supreme Court. On February 13, 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial, for which she was censured by the Alaska Republican Party.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early career[edit]\n\n\nMurkowski was born in Ketchikan in the Territory of Alaska, the daughter of Nancy Rena (née Gore) and Frank Murkowski.[1] Her paternal great-grandfather was of Polish descent, and her mother's ancestry is Irish and French Canadian.[2] As a child, she and her family moved around the state with her father's job as a banker.\n\n\nShe earned a B.A. degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1980, the same year her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. She is a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority[3] and represented Alaska as the 1980 Cherry Blossom Princess.[4] She received her J.D. degree in 1985 from Willamette University College of Law.[5]\n\n\nMurkowski worked as an attorney in the Anchorage District Court Clerk's office from 1987 to 1989.[6] From 1989 to 1998, she was an attorney in private practice in Anchorage. She served on the Mayor's Task Force for the Homeless from 1990 to 1991.[7]\n\n\n\n## Alaska House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Murkowski was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives. Her District 18 included northeast Anchorage, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base (now Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, or JBER), and suburban parts of Eagle River-Chugiak. In 1999, she introduced legislation establishing a Joint Armed Services Committee. She was reelected in 2000 and, after her district boundaries changed, in 2002. That year she had a conservative primary opponent, Nancy Dahlstrom, who challenged her because Murkowski supported abortion rights and rejected conservative economics. Murkowski prevailed by 56 votes.[8][9] She was named as House Majority Leader for the 2003–04 legislative session. She resigned her House seat before taking office, due to her appointment by her father to the seat he had vacated in the U.S. Senate, upon his stepping down to assume the Alaska governorship.[10] Murkowski sat on the Alaska Commission on Post Secondary Education and chaired both the Labor and Commerce and the Military and Veterans Affairs Committees. After she resigned to join the U.S. Senate, her father appointed Dahlstrom, the District Republican committee's choice, as her replacement.[9]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2002, Murkowski—while a member of the state House—was appointed by her father, Governor Frank Murkowski, to fill his own U.S. Senate seat made vacant when he resigned from the Senate after being elected governor.\n\n\nThe appointment caused controversy in Alaska. Many voters disapproved of the nepotism. Her appointment eventually resulted in a referendum that stripped the governor of his power to directly appoint replacement senators.[11] Along with others eligible to be considered, future Alaska governor Sarah Palin interviewed unsuccessfully for the seat.[8]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Murkowski in 2005\nMurkowski has had several close challenges but has never lost an election. She has won four full terms to the Senate; she won 48.6% of the vote in 2004, 39.5% in 2010, 44.4% in 2016 and 53.7% in 2022.[12]\n\n\n\n#### 2004[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2004 United States Senate election in Alaska\n\nMurkowski ran for a full Senate term against former Governor Tony Knowles in the 2004 election after winning a primary challenge by a large margin. She was considered vulnerable due to the controversy over her appointment, and polling showed the race was very close. The centrist Republican Main Street Partnership, which wanted to run TV ads for Murkowski, was told no airtime was left to buy.[13] Near the end of the campaign, senior U.S. Senator Ted Stevens shot ads for Murkowski and claimed that if a Democrat replaced Murkowski, Alaska would likely receive fewer federal dollars.[*citation needed*] Murkowski defeated Knowles by a narrow margin.\n\n\n\n#### 2010[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2010 United States Senate election in Alaska and Miller v. Campbell\n\nMurkowski faced the most difficult election of her career in the August 24, 2010, Republican Party primary election against Joe Miller, a former U.S. magistrate judge[14] supported by former Governor Sarah Palin.[15][16] The initial results showed her trailing Miller, 51–49%, with absentee ballots yet to be tallied.[17] After the first round of absentee ballots were counted on August 31, Murkowski conceded, saying that she did not believe that Miller's lead could be overcome in the next round of absentee vote counting.[18][19]\n\n\nAfter the primary, the Murkowski campaign floated the idea of her running as a Libertarian in the general election.[20] But on August 29, 2010, the state Libertarian Party executive board voted not to consider Murkowski as its Senate nominee.[21]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2010, Murkowski said that she would mount a write-in campaign for the Senate seat.[22] Her campaign was aided in large part by substantial monetary assistance from Native corporations and PACs, as well as state teachers' and firefighters' unions.[23]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Murkowski had become only the second Senate candidate (after Strom Thurmond in 1954) to win a write-in campaign, thereby retaining her seat.[24][25] She emerged victorious after a two-week count of write-in ballots showed she had overtaken Miller.[26][27] Miller did not concede.[27] U.S. Federal District Judge Ralph Beistline granted an injunction to stop the certification of the election due to \"serious\" legal issues and irregularities Miller raised about the hand count of absentee ballots.[28] On December 10, 2010, an Alaskan judge dismissed Miller's case, clearing the way for Murkowski,[29] but on December 13, Miller appealed the Alaska Superior Court decision of the previous week to the Alaska Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court rejected Miller's appeal on December 22.[30] On December 28, U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline dismissed Miller's lawsuit. Governor Sean Parnell certified Murkowski as the winner on December 30.[31]\n\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2016 United States Senate election in Alaska\n\nAfter securing the Republican Party nomination by a wide margin, Murkowski was again reelected to the Senate in 2016. Joe Miller, this time the Libertarian Party nominee, was again the runner-up.\n\n\nThe election was unusual in featuring a Libertarian Party nominee who endorsed the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, running against a Republican incumbent who did not.[32] The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld, endorsed Murkowski, citing Miller's support for Trump and \"devoted social conservative\" views as incompatible with libertarianism.\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Alaska\n\nIn 2017, Murkowski filed to run for a fourth term in 2022.[33] Due to her opposition to some of his initiatives and her vote to convict him during his second impeachment trial, former President Donald Trump pledged in June 2020 to campaign against Murkowski, implicitly endorsing a primary challenge in the process.[34][35] Of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump, Murkowski was the only one up for reelection in 2022. After the second impeachment trial, Alaska's GOP had censured her and demanded her resignation.[35] Despite Trump's pledge, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Republican senators' commitment to back Murkowski's 2022 campaign.[36]\n\n\nOn June 18, 2021, Trump endorsed former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka for the Senate in 2022, calling her \"MAGA all the way\".[37] Murkowski later called Tshibaka \"apparently...someone with a pulse\",[38] referencing Trump's previous statement that \"if [any 2022 Murkowski challenger has] a pulse, [he is] with [them]\".[39] On July 10, 2021, the Alaska Republican Party endorsed Tshibaka.[40] Murkowski won reelection by beating Tshibaka in ranked-choice voting.[41] Murkowski's votes amounted to 53.7% after the ranked-choice tabulation.[42]\n\n\n\n### Tenure and political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Lisa Murkowski\n\nMurkowski is considered a moderate Republican.[43][44] Since she was reelected in 2010, some have deemed her voting record \"more moderate\" than that of her previous years in the Senate.[45] In 2013, the *National Journal* gave Murkowski a composite score of 56% conservative and 45% liberal[46] and ranked her the 56th most liberal and 44th most conservative member of the Senate.[47]\n\n\nAccording to GovTrack, Murkowski is the second most liberal Republican senator and, as of 2017[update], is placed by GovTrack's analysis to the left of all Republicans except Susan Collins, and to the left of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin.[48] *The New York Times* arranged Republican senators by ideology and also ranked Murkowski the second most liberal Republican.[49][50] According to FiveThirtyEight, which tracks congressional votes, she voted with Trump's position approximately 72.6% of the time as of January 2021[update].[51] According to FiveThirtyEight, as of October 2022, Murkowski has voted with Biden's position about 67% of the time.[52] According to *CQ Roll Call*, Murkowski voted with President Barack Obama's position 72.3% of the time in 2013, one of only two Republicans voting for his positions over 70% of the time.[53] According to the American Conservative Union's Center for Legislative Accountability, Murkowski has a lifetime conservative score of 56.72.[54] The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave her a score of 10% in 2019.[55]\n\n\nIn 2018, she voted \"present\" on the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States as a favor to Senator Steve Daines, who was unable to attend the vote because his daughter's wedding took place that day.[56] In 2020, she voted against procedural motions to accelerate Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to that court, though she later voted to confirm Barrett.[57] On April 7, 2022, she voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, with only two other Republicans joining her: Mitt Romney and Susan Collins.[58]\n\n\nIn a March 2019 op-ed for *The Washington Post*, Murkowski and Joe Manchin wrote that climate change debate in Congress was depicted as \"an issue with just two sides—those who support drastic, unattainable measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and those who want to do nothing\" and affirmed their support for \"adopting reasonable policies that maintain that edge, build on and accelerate current efforts, and ensure a robust innovation ecosystem.\"[59]\n\n\nIn December 2020, during his lame-duck period, Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.[60] The veto left new Coast Guard cutters that were scheduled to be homeported in Alaska without port facilities to maintain them.[60] Murkowski issued a press release that said, in part, \"It’s incredible that the President chose to veto the annual National Defense Authorization Act, particularly because his reason for doing so is an issue not related to national defense.\"[60]\n\n\nAfter Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, Murkowski said Trump should resign for inciting the insurrection. With this call for his resignation, she became the first Republican in the Senate to say that Trump should leave office before the inauguration of Joe Biden. When asked whether she would remain a Republican, she replied, \"if the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me\",[61] but added, \"I have absolutely no desire to move over to the Democratic side of the aisle. I can't be somebody that I'm not.\"[62] On May 27, 2021, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, Murkowski voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack. The vote failed for lack of 60 required \"yes\" votes.[63] She was one of seven Republican senators to vote on February 13, 2021, to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. That vote failed for lack of a two-thirds majority.[64]\n\n\nMurkowski, along with all other Senate and House Republicans, voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[65] On September 30, 2021, she was among the 15 Senate Republicans to vote with all Democrats and both Independents for a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.[66][67] On October 7, 2021, Murkowski voted with 10 other Republicans and all members of the Democratic caucus to break the filibuster of raising the debt ceiling.[68][69] However, she voted with all Republicans against the bill to raise the debt ceiling.[70] On February 5, 2022, Murkowski joined Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in condemning the Republican National Committee's censure of Representatives Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for supporting and participating in the Select Committee of the U.S. House that was tasked with investigating the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[71] The RNC contended that the Capitol riot was \"legitimate political discourse.\"[71] During her 2022 reelection campaign, Murkowski was supported by Democratic colleagues, including Jeanne Shaheen, and Independent Senator Angus King.[72]\n\n\nMurkowski supports the Equal Rights Amendment.[73]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Murkowski supports ConocoPhillips's controversial Willow oil drilling project on North Slope Borough, Alaska.[74]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Legislative Branch\n\t+ Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n* Committee on Indian Affairs (Vice Chair)\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Senate Oceans Caucus (co-chairwoman)\n* Senate Cultural Caucus\n* Afterschool Caucuses[75]\n* Senate Republican Conference\n* Senate Arctic Caucus (chairwoman)\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, Republican primary results, 1998[76]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski**  | **830**  | **65.6%**  |\n|  | Republican | Mike Miller\n | 436\n | 34.4%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,266**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, election results, 1998[77]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski**  | **2,676**  | **96.5%**  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 96\n | 3.5%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **2,772**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, Republican primary results, 2000[78]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski (incumbent)**  | **368**  | **100%**  |\n| Total votes\n | **368**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 14, election results, 2000[79]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski (incumbent)**  | **3,828**  | **96.40%**  |\n|  | Write-ins\n |  | 145\n | 3.6%\n |\n| Total votes\n | **3,973**  | **100%**  |\n\n\n\n\nAlaska House of Representatives, District 18, Republican primary results, 2002[80]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Lisa Murkowski**  | **486**  | **53.1%**  |\n|  | Republican | Nancy A.

A resident of Charleston, Capito was educated at the Holton-Arms School, a private college-preparatory school in Bethesda, Maryland;[3] Duke University, where she earned her bachelor's degree in zoology; and the University of Virginia School of Education and Human Development, where she earned her master's degree.[4] She is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority[5] and represented West Virginia as the 1972 Cherry Blossom Princess.[6]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning her master's degree, Capito was a career counselor at West Virginia State University and director of the educational information center for the West Virginia Board of Regents.[7]\n\n\nCapito was elected to Kanawha County's seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1996, and served two terms, from 1996 to 2000.[8]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito with President George W.

According to Capito, she wasn't aware of Foley's conduct until informed by the press.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito gained large majorities of the vote along the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia borders.\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in West Virginia\n\nOn November 26, 2012, Capito announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2014, intending to challenge Democratic incumbent Jay Rockefeller,[30] who subsequently announced his retirement.[31] Despite initial protests from Tea Party groups and anti-establishment conservatives that her House voting record was \"too liberal\",[32] Capito won 87% of the Republican primary vote,[33] and defeated Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in the general election, 62% to 34%.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in West Virginia\n\nIn her 2020 reelection campaign, Capito easily defeated Republican primary challengers Allen Whitt and Larry Butcher, before facing Democratic nominee Paula Jean Swearengin in the general election.[35] Swearengin, a progressive activist whose 2018 U.S. Senate campaign was featured in the Netflix documentary *Knock Down the House*, defeated state senator Richard Ojeda and former South Charleston mayor Richie Robb in the Democratic primary race.[36]\n\n\nIn the November general election, Capito defeated Swearengin with over 70% of the vote.[37]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito congressional photo 2013\nOn January 5, 2016, Mitch McConnell appointed Capito as counsel to the majority leader, along with Rob Portman and Deb Fischer.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[40][edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Defense\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security (Ranking)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works (Ranking)\n\t+ As ranking member of the whole committee, Moore Capito serves as an ex officio member on all the subcommittees.\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Republican Main Street Partnership[41]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nCapito has voted with her party 96% of the time.[42] She is considered relatively moderate and has crossed the aisle on some votes.[43][44] In 2017, *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post* reported that Capito was one of the three most moderate Republican senators according to a study by *DW-NOMINATE*.[45][46][47] In June 2019, The Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy ranked Capito the seventh most bipartisan member of Congress based on her tenure in the House and Senate.[44] According to FiveThirtyEight, as of July 2023, Capito has voted with President Biden's position about 56% of the time.[48]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump's candidacy and presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito with President Donald Trump in 2019\nIn 2016, Capito raised concerns about Trump's tone and rhetoric during the election.[49] After the *Access Hollywood* tape emerged, Capito said he should \"reexamine his candidacy.\"[50] But she later said she supported Trump for president.[51] In 2020, Capito said she would be \"impartial\" and \"fair\" to both sides during Trump's Senate trial after his impeachment in the House,[52] and voted to acquit him. According to FiveThirtyEight, she had voted with the Trump administration's position 94.9% of the time.[53]\n\n\nAs of November 19, 2020, Capito had not publicly acknowledged that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, though it had been called by all major media and analysts.[54] By November 23, she issued a statement recognizing that Biden would be the next president.[55][56] By December 5, she was among only 27 congressional Republicans to acknowledge Biden as the winner of the election.[57][58] Trump subsequently attacked them, calling them RINOs.[59][60]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Capito voted against creating the January 6 commission.[61] Asked about Trump's future role in the Republican Party, she said she partially blamed Trump for the \"insurrection\" and that she does not think he will be the GOP nominee for president in 2024.[62]\n\n\n\n### Social policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito is a sponsor of the Gender Advancement in Pay (GAP) Act,[*clarification needed*] saying, \"it should be common sense that women and men get equal pay for equal work\" and expressing concern about sex discrimination against women in the workplace.[63] She is a sponsor of the Rural Access to Hospice Act to improve the quality, access, and retention of hospice facilities in rural parts of the nation.[64] She opposes the Freedom to Vote Act which, among other reforms, would establish Election Day as a public holiday and \"ensure states have early voting for federal elections, overhaul how congressional districts are redrawn and impose new disclosures on donations to outside groups active in political campaigns.\"[65] \n\n![](image)Capito addressing CPAC in 2013 On social policy, the *National Journal* gave Capito a score of 54% conservative and 43% liberal.[43]\n\n\n#### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nCapito has a mixed record on LGBT issues. The Human Rights Campaign gave her a score of 30% in the 113th Congress and 64% in the 114th Congress.[66] She received a 0% score in the 115th Congress and a 10% in the 116th Congress.[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2004 and 2006, Capito voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment, which intended to ban same-sex marriage in the United States.[69] But in 2015, she said she believed marriage was a state issue.[70] In 2007 Capito voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and against repealing the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy.[71]\n\n\nIn 2009, Capito voted for the 2009-2010 Defense Appropriations bill, which expanded the legal definition of a hate crime to include crimes committed because of someone's gender identity.[71] Also that year, she voted against legislation that defined hate crimes as including those committed because of someone's sexual orientation.[72] In 2013, she voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which includes provisions to assist victims regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity and prohibits funding programs that discriminate.[71]\n\n\nIn 2015, Capito voted for an amendment to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act that provided support and protections for LGBT youth.[73] In 2015, she voted to give same-sex married couples access to Social Security and veterans' benefits.[74][75] In 2017, Capito disagreed with President Trump's use of Twitter to announce a ban on transgender troops in the military, saying, \"we should be thankful for any American who selflessly serves our country to defend our freedoms.\"[76][77] In 2021, she released a statement that she opposed the inclusion of trans youth in the sporting programs of their gender identity; in particular, she opposed the inclusion of trans girls in girls' sporting teams and introduced legislation to ban trans girls from participating.[78]\n\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, which found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Capito said, \"While I would have preferred that the Supreme Court leave this decision to the states, it is my hope that all West Virginians will move forward and continue to care for and respect one another.\"[79] In November 2022, Capito was one of 12 Republicans voting to advance legislation, the Respect for Marriage Act, to codify same-sex marriage into federal law; referring to civil same-sex marriage as a \"civil partnership,\" Capito said that the \"legislation will allow those who have entered into a civil partnership since the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, to continue to have their partnerships respected for federal benefit purposes.\"[80][81][82] She voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act on November 29, 2022.[83][84]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nCapito had described herself as \"pro-choice,\" or pro-abortion rights, but has a mixed record on abortion.[85][86][87][88] She had previously been among the few Republican senators who publicly supported *Roe v. Wade*, the Supreme Court decision ruling abortion bans unconstitutional.[89][90][91][92] But in 2020, she declared her support for March for Life, an anti-abortion movement,[93] and in 2022, she reversed her position on *Roe*, saying she believes states should be free to ban abortion.[94][95] She supports legal abortion in cases when the pregnant patient's health is at risk and said abortions should be rare.[96] She has mixed ratings from anti-abortion organizations opposing abortion and abortion rights organizations advocating legal abortion.[97][98] In 2002, her third-largest contributor was The WISH List, an abortion rights PAC.[99] In 2000, she received support from Republicans for Choice.[100] She has been endorsed by West Virginians for Life, an anti-abortion PAC, the WISH List, and by Republican Majority for Choice, an abortion rights PAC.[101][102][103]\n\n\nCapito voted against federal funding for abortion and for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, but against banning family-planning funding in US aid. She previously opposed the Hyde Amendment, but now supports it.[104][105] She supported federal funding for family planning in the House[106] but voted to require parental consent for minors seeking an abortion.[107] She opposed banning funds for mifepristone, the \"abortion pill\".[108] She voted for spending bills funding Planned Parenthood and against a bill to defund it, but has also voted to defund Planned Parenthood.[109][110][111][112] She is against bans on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy,[113] but supports banning abortion after 20 weeks.[114] She voted with her party in 2018 to ban federal funding for facilities that promote abortion.[115] Capito supports other anti-abortion legislation supported by her party.[116][117][118][119][120][121] In 2021, she signed a letter put forward by the Senate's anti-abortion caucus opposing the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and opposing legislation to liberalize current federal abortion laws.[122][123][124]\n\n\nIn 2017, \"West Virginians for Life, said [it] still supports Capito, despite the abortion rights self-identification and support for Roe v. Wade, because of Capito's steadfast voting record restricting abortions and defunding Planned Parenthood\".[125] In 2018, Capito said she was neutral on an initiative to ban abortion in West Virginia.[126] She supported Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh; when asked about *Roe*, Capito said she does not think the court will overturn the ruling. \"Fundamentally, it's been a precedent for a long time,\" she said.[127][128] Capito also supported Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.[129] Barrett signed a letter calling for the end of *Roe v. Wade,* and supported a group that holds that life begins at fertilization.[130][131] In 2020, Capito declined to sign an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to reconsider *Roe*.[132][133][134] Also in 2021, she was one of just three Senate Republicans (with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski) to decline to sign amicus briefs in the Mississippi case that seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.[135] Asked about a 2022 draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn *Roe v. Wade*, reportedly joined by Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, all of whom Capito voted to confirm, she responded by criticizing the leak of the draft and said, \"this is a draft opinion that is not binding Supreme Court precedent. *Roe* still remains the law of the land until the Supreme Court issues its final ruling.\"[136][137][138] After the Supreme Court overturned *Roe* in the *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* decision, Capito said she supported the court's decision and believed the issue should be decided at the state level.[139][140] In September 2022, Capito said she was opposed to a national 15-week abortion ban proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.[141][142][143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Sexual assault[edit]\n\n\nCapito is partnering with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand, Patty Murray, Amy Klobuchar and other bipartisan members of Congress to update the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995.[145] In August 2018, She and Senator Joe Manchin announced $899,927 for the West Virginia Foundation for Rape Information and Services through the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women.[146]\n\n\n\n#### Embryonic stem-cell research[edit]\n\n\nCapito supports embryonic stem cell research. In 2001, Capito voted for a bill to ban the cloning of human embryos.[147] In May 2005, as a representative, Capito broke with her party, voting with a majority of Democrats, to repeal restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research funding.[148] Capito also voted in 2006 to attempt to override President Bush's veto of the 2005 bill.[147] Also in 2007, Capito again voted in favor of funding stem-cell research.[147] She also voted in favor of research using stem cells derived from donated embryos.[149] In 2009, Capito voted for a budget bill that prohibited the creation of human embryos for research.[147]\n\n\n\n#### Gun rights[edit]\n\n\nCapito was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and West Virginia Citizen's Defense League which both support gun owners' rights in 2014.[150] In 2016, she voted in favor of alerting law enforcement when a person suspected of terrorism attempts to purchase a firearm and in favor of an amendment to improve the National Instant Background Check System, but she voted against two other gun control amendments.[151] In 2018, Capito opposed President Trump's suggestion that teachers be armed, saying, \"I don't think a teacher should carry a gun in a classroom.\"[152] In January 2019, she was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state's laws.[153] Capito said she was open to supporting red flag laws.[154] As of 2020, the NRA has given her a rating of 92%, for supporting their positions, and Gun Owners of America gives her a 69% rating.[155]\n\n\n\n#### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nAs a representative, Capito opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act). Since then, she had voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[156] In July 2017, Capito opposed repealing the ACA without a replacement proposal, and was one of three Republican senators, along with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who blocked a bill to repeal the ACA without a replacement early in the attempted repeal process.[157] Later that July, she voted to repeal the ACA.[158]\n\n\nCapito was one of a few Republicans who broke with their party in favor of the State Children's Health Insurance Program.[159] In January 2009, she voted to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as part of its reauthorization. The expanded coverage would include about four million more children in the program.[160] In May 2008, Capito voted for the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (commonly called the new G.I. Bill), which expanded the educational benefits for military veterans who have served since September 11, 2001.[161] During the 112th Congress, she voted for H.R. 525 to expand the ACA grant programs.[162] In 2014, she supported repealing the Affordable Care Act.[163]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2017, Capito supported preserving the ACA's Medicaid expansion in any GOP bill to repeal it .[164] With three other Republicans, she signed a letter opposing the House plan to repeal the ACA.[165][166] She opposed the Better Care Reconciliation Act because of her opposition to an amendment to the bill as well as over opioid issues.[167][168] She was one of seven Republicans who voted against repealing the ACA without a replacement.[169][170][171]\n\n\nIn 2018, Capito voted for the bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act to address the nation's opioid crisis.[172][173] She also voted to increase Telemedicine funding in five West Virginia counties.[174]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Capito cosponsored the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, a bipartisan bill that would continue federal funding of community health centers and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) beyond that year's September 30 deadline for five years and provide both with yearly federal funding increases beginning in fiscal year 2020.[175] In 2021, she announced support for increasing funding for virtual healthcare options, and she co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to expand seniors' access to Telehealth, with \"virtual [healthcare] visits.\"[176] She supports extending Medicare to cover therapies to prevent diabetes.[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nCapito has said that she does not support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but voted against a 2004 bill that would have forced hospitals to report undocumented immigrants; she also voted for a 2001 bill to allow some immigrants to \"remain in the country while pursuing residency\".[179] In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act.[180] In 2018, Capito said of DACA and immigration, \"It's probably going to be some sort of legal status for DACA recipients that gives them the permanence of legal status and then the border security\".[181] Of her views on DACA, Capito's office said that she \"could support an immigration solution that provides for increased border security to protect Americans and provides relief for those in the DACA program. She is encouraged by ongoing negotiations between the Trump Administration and members of Congress to improve immigration policy and add resources for enforcement.\"[182]\n\n\nIn 2018, Capito voted to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, voted against the McCain-Coons proposal to offer a pathway to citizenship without funding for a border wall, against Senator Collins's bipartisan bill to increase funding for border security and offer a pathway to citizenship, and in favor of Trump's proposal to offer a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants while reducing legal immigration numbers and using federal funds to build a border wall.[183] In December 2018, Capito supported a bipartisan compromise funding bill that would have allocated $1.6 billion, instead of the $5 billion Trump requested, for a border wall to avoid a government shutdown.[184]\n\n\nCapito voiced disagreement with Trump's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that included separating children from their parents or guardians. She said, \"we need to keep the families together\".[185] In 2019, she supported legislation to increase funding and humanitarian aid for \"relief and comfort for migrants\" on the US southern border.[186] She also voted in committee for a bipartisan plan with $4.6 billion in funding with \"$2.9 billion for the care of migrant children and $1.3 billion to improve facilities at the border\".[187]\n\n\nSpecial interest groups for and against immigration reform have given Capito mixed ratings. NumbersUSA, which opposes illegal immigration and seeks to reduce legal immigration, gave her an 81% score and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which also opposes illegal immigration and wants to reduce legal immigration, gave her an 88% score; conversely, the Hispanic Federation and UnidosUS, which both support immigration, gave Capito a 59% rating.[150]\n\n\n\n#### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito disagreed with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions's 2018 memo on marijuana-related prosecutions, saying, \"I'm going to go on the record as saying I'm against recreational marijuana, but I respect the states' rights to make that decision\".[188] She also said that she had concerns, but accepted and supported the legalization of medical marijuana.[189] She received a 42% rating from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which supports the decriminalization of marijuana.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito has received at lifetime rating of 17% from the League of Conservation Voters, indicating an anti-environment voting record.[190] In 2018, she voted for a bill that would curtail the federal government's ability to regulate fracking. She has also voted to restrict the Department of the Interior's ability to regulate methane emissions.[191]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Capito was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"[192] In 2020, she cosponsored legislation with fellow West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin to \"enhance a tax credit that Congress expanded in 2018 to spur investment in carbon capture technology.\"[193]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito has sponsored approximately 40 bills about international trade and international finance, the most of any other legislative topic during her career.[194] She criticized the vulnerabilities in national security policy in the wake of the 2015 San Bernardino attack[195] and has sponsored eight bills on the military and national security.[194] Capito was one of 47 Republican senators to sign Senator Tom Cotton's open letter to the Iranian government in 2015.[196] The letter, which sought to dissuade Iran from reaching an agreement with President Barack Obama on nuclear peace, was described by the White House as \"undercutting foreign policy\".[197]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Capito co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[198][199]\n\n\nOn foreign policy, the *National Journal* gave her a score of 77% conservative and 15% liberal.[43]\n\n\n\n#### International trade[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Capito voted against the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the major trade agreement negotiated under President George W. Bush. In 2003, 2004, and 2007, she voted to approve free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, and Peru. She supports tariffs against countries that manipulate currencies, and she sponsored a bill that would create an import fee on countries with an undervalued currency.[43]\n\n\n\n### Interior policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito supports the Republican Main Street Partnership's motion to elevate the EPA to be a Cabinet-level department, which would bring more oversight to the entity.[200]\n\n\nCapito opposes legislation aimed at capping greenhouse gas emissions.[201] In January 2010, she reportedly asked the president if he would reconsider \"job-killing\" policies like limiting greenhouse gases.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)Capito meets with President Biden in the Oval Office during discussions about an infrastructure bill.\nIn March 2011, Capito and other members of West Virginia's House delegation co-sponsored a campaign to allow the remains of the last American living veteran of World War I, Frank Buckles, to lie in state at the Capitol rotunda. The move, requested by Buckles's family, had been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner. Reid and Boehner supported a special ceremony at the Arlington National Cemetery. Capito said, \"This is a matter close to the hearts of many West Virginians, but everyone can appreciate the desire to come together one last time to respect and remember America’s last doughboy\". The campaign was unsuccessful and Buckles lay in honor at the Arlington National Cemetery.[203]\n\n\nCapito supported Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. She called the decision \"the right decision for the American economy and workers in West Virginia and across the country.\"[204] She supports regulations implemented by the EPA, based on her bipartisan legislation, to increase clean water standards.[205]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, the fiscally conservative PAC the Club for Growth gave her a 50% lifetime rating.[97] In 2011, while in the House, Capito voted for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution.[206] In 2020, she said she opposed cuts to government spending, but also opposed any increases.[207]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Capito voted to extend the tax cuts enacted during the administration of President George W. Bush.[208]\n\n\nCapito supports a federal prohibition on online poker. In 2006, she cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act.[209] She also supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[210] In June 2003, Capito introduced the Family Fairness in Taxing Act of 2003, which would accelerate the increase to the child tax credit, increase the qualification age for children, and revise refundability criteria for the credit.[211]\n\n\nIn 2001, Capito voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts.[212] In 2002, she supported partially privatizing Social Security but opposed complete privatization.[213] In 2006, Capito joined Democrats to vote for an increase of the minimum wage.[214] In 2012, during her campaign for the Senate, the Senate Conservative Fund opposed her nomination because \"her spending record in the House is too liberal\".[215] In 2013, she voted against cutting funding for food stamps.[216] In 2017, Capito opposed President Trump's proposed budget, saying that it would cut \"too close to the bone\".[217] In 2017, she said she supported full repeal of the inheritance tax.[218] She also voted in favor of Trump's tax cut bill.[219] In 2019, she came out against budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.[220] Capito was among a few Republicans, including Joni Ernst of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine, to express criticism of Trump's nominee to the Federal Reserve, Stephen Moore, because of comments he had made about women; he ultimately withdrew the nomination.[221][222][223] In 2019, Capito announced support for paid family leave.[224] In 2020, she opposed budget cuts due to the \"spending needs\" of states like West Virginia.[225] On September 30, 2021, she was among 15 Senate Republicans to vote with all Democrats and both Independents for a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.[226][227] On October 7, 2021, she was one of 11 Republicans voting with all members of the Democratic caucus to end a filibuster on raising the debt ceiling,[228][229] but voted against the bill to raise the debt ceiling.[230] On August 10, 2021, Capito was one of 19 Senate Republicans to vote with the Democratic caucus in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[231] On economic issues, the *National Journal* gave her a rating of 53% conservative and 47% liberal.[43]\n\n\n\n### Judiciary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito meets with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, July 2018\nCapito opposed having a hearing for President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to the Supreme Court due to the nomination's proximity to the 2016 presidential election.[232] In 2017, she voted to confirm President Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.[233] After Trump nominated a second justice, Capito announced her support for the nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and after he was accused of sexual assault, she continued to support his nomination.[233] But she also said she considered the allegation serious and was among a handful of Republican senators to ask for a vote to be delayed in order to hear from the accuser and from Kavanaugh.[234] Some of her fellow alumnae from the Holton-Arms School personally delivered her a letter signed by more than a thousand alumnae of the school, saying that they believe Kavanaugh's accuser because her allegations are \"all too consistent with stories we heard and lived\" while attending Holton-Arms.[235]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Capito was one of 12 senators to cosponsor a resolution that would impose a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices. The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to the idea of expanding the seats on the Supreme Court.[236]\n\n\nIn September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Capito supported an immediate vote on Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. In March 2016, she took the opposite position when facing Obama's nominee, saying that a justice should not be considered during a presidential election year because \"West Virginians and the American people should have the ability to weigh in at the ballot box\".[237] As of November 2021, Capito had a mixed voting record on Biden's judicial nominees.[238][239][240][241]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidential speculation[edit]\n\n\nCapito was considered a possible contender for vice president on the Republican ticket with Donald Trump in 2016,[242][243] and in May 2016 she was one of several senators to meet with Trump in Washington, D.C.[244] In the end, Trump picked Indiana Governor and former U.S. Representative Mike Pence to join him on the Republican ticket.\n\n\n\n## Electoral

Capito, and they have three children: sons Charles and Moore, and daughter Shelley.[264] Her father served over two years in prison on corruption charges. Her sister, Lucy Moore Durbin, was arrested in 1992 along with her husband for selling cocaine to an undercover officer.[265] Capito and the Moore Capito family are members of First Presbyterian Church in Charleston, West Virginia, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (USA).[266][267][268]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *Runner's World* featured Capito in its \"I'm a Runner\" vlog, where she states she has been a distance runner for over 30 years.[269]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Livingston, Abby (July 9, 2014). \"Shelley Moore Capito Campaigns Amid Father's Complicated Legacy\". *Roll Call*.

A member of the Republican Party, Capito served seven terms as the U.S. representative from West Virginia's 2nd congressional district from 2001 to 2015. The daughter of three-term West Virginia governor Arch Alfred Moore Jr.,[1] she is the dean of West Virginia's congressional delegation.\n\n\nCapito was the only Republican in West Virginia's congressional delegation until 2011, and the first Republican woman elected to Congress from West Virginia. She was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from West Virginia[2] and the first Republican to win a full term in the Senate from West Virginia since 1942. She was reelected in 2020, defeating Democratic nominee Paula Jean Swearengin, and becoming the first West Virginia Republican reelected to the Senate since 1907.\n\n\nSince 2021, she has served as the ranking member of the Senate Environment Committee.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nShelley Wellons Moore Capito was born in Glen Dale, West Virginia, the daughter of Shelley (née Riley) and Arch Alfred Moore Jr., who served three terms as the state's governor. A resident of Charleston, Capito was educated at the Holton-Arms School, a private college-preparatory school in Bethesda, Maryland;[3] Duke University, where she earned her bachelor's degree in zoology; and the University of Virginia School of Education and Human Development, where she earned her master's degree.[4] She is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority[5] and represented West Virginia as the 1972 Cherry Blossom Princess.[6]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning her master's degree, Capito was a career counselor at West Virginia State University and director of the educational information center for the West Virginia Board of Regents.[7]\n\n\nCapito was elected to Kanawha County's seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1996, and served two terms, from 1996 to 2000.[8]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito with President George W.

According to Capito, she wasn't aware of Foley's conduct until informed by the press.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito gained large majorities of the vote along the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia borders.\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States Senate election in West Virginia\n\nOn November 26, 2012, Capito announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2014, intending to challenge Democratic incumbent Jay Rockefeller,[30] who subsequently announced his retirement.[31] Despite initial protests from Tea Party groups and anti-establishment conservatives that her House voting record was \"too liberal\",[32] Capito won 87% of the Republican primary vote,[33] and defeated Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in the general election, 62% to 34%.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 United States Senate election in West Virginia\n\nIn her 2020 reelection campaign, Capito easily defeated Republican primary challengers Allen Whitt and Larry Butcher, before facing Democratic nominee Paula Jean Swearengin in the general election.[35] Swearengin, a progressive activist whose 2018 U.S. Senate campaign was featured in the Netflix documentary *Knock Down the House*, defeated state senator Richard Ojeda and former South Charleston mayor Richie Robb in the Democratic primary race.[36]\n\n\nIn the November general election, Capito defeated Swearengin with over 70% of the vote.[37]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito congressional photo 2013\nOn January 5, 2016, Mitch McConnell appointed Capito as counsel to the majority leader, along with Rob Portman and Deb Fischer.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[40][edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Defense\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security (Ranking)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\t+ Subcommittee on Communications, Media, and Broadband\n\t+ Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security\n* Committee on Environment and Public Works (Ranking)\n\t+ As ranking member of the whole committee, Moore Capito serves as an ex officio member on all the subcommittees.\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Republican Main Street Partnership[41]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nCapito has voted with her party 96% of the time.[42] She is considered relatively moderate and has crossed the aisle on some votes.[43][44] In 2017, *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post* reported that Capito was one of the three most moderate Republican senators according to a study by *DW-NOMINATE*.[45][46][47] In June 2019, The Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy ranked Capito the seventh most bipartisan member of Congress based on her tenure in the House and Senate.[44] According to FiveThirtyEight, as of July 2023, Capito has voted with President Biden's position about 56% of the time.[48]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump's candidacy and presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito with President Donald Trump in 2019\nIn 2016, Capito raised concerns about Trump's tone and rhetoric during the election.[49] After the *Access Hollywood* tape emerged, Capito said he should \"reexamine his candidacy.\"[50] But she later said she supported Trump for president.[51] In 2020, Capito said she would be \"impartial\" and \"fair\" to both sides during Trump's Senate trial after his impeachment in the House,[52] and voted to acquit him. According to FiveThirtyEight, she had voted with the Trump administration's position 94.9% of the time.[53]\n\n\nAs of November 19, 2020, Capito had not publicly acknowledged that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election, though it had been called by all major media and analysts.[54] By November 23, she issued a statement recognizing that Biden would be the next president.[55][56] By December 5, she was among only 27 congressional Republicans to acknowledge Biden as the winner of the election.[57][58] Trump subsequently attacked them, calling them RINOs.[59][60]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Capito voted against creating the January 6 commission.[61] Asked about Trump's future role in the Republican Party, she said she partially blamed Trump for the \"insurrection\" and that she does not think he will be the GOP nominee for president in 2024.[62]\n\n\n\n### Social policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito is a sponsor of the Gender Advancement in Pay (GAP) Act,[*clarification needed*] saying, \"it should be common sense that women and men get equal pay for equal work\" and expressing concern about sex discrimination against women in the workplace.[63] She is a sponsor of the Rural Access to Hospice Act to improve the quality, access, and retention of hospice facilities in rural parts of the nation.[64] She opposes the Freedom to Vote Act which, among other reforms, would establish Election Day as a public holiday and \"ensure states have early voting for federal elections, overhaul how congressional districts are redrawn and impose new disclosures on donations to outside groups active in political campaigns.\"[65] \n\n![](image)Capito addressing CPAC in 2013 On social policy, the *National Journal* gave Capito a score of 54% conservative and 43% liberal.[43]\n\n\n#### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nCapito has a mixed record on LGBT issues. The Human Rights Campaign gave her a score of 30% in the 113th Congress and 64% in the 114th Congress.[66] She received a 0% score in the 115th Congress and a 10% in the 116th Congress.[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2004 and 2006, Capito voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment, which intended to ban same-sex marriage in the United States.[69] But in 2015, she said she believed marriage was a state issue.[70] In 2007 Capito voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and against repealing the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy.[71]\n\n\nIn 2009, Capito voted for the 2009-2010 Defense Appropriations bill, which expanded the legal definition of a hate crime to include crimes committed because of someone's gender identity.[71] Also that year, she voted against legislation that defined hate crimes as including those committed because of someone's sexual orientation.[72] In 2013, she voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which includes provisions to assist victims regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity and prohibits funding programs that discriminate.[71]\n\n\nIn 2015, Capito voted for an amendment to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act that provided support and protections for LGBT youth.[73] In 2015, she voted to give same-sex married couples access to Social Security and veterans' benefits.[74][75] In 2017, Capito disagreed with President Trump's use of Twitter to announce a ban on transgender troops in the military, saying, \"we should be thankful for any American who selflessly serves our country to defend our freedoms.\"[76][77] In 2021, she released a statement that she opposed the inclusion of trans youth in the sporting programs of their gender identity; in particular, she opposed the inclusion of trans girls in girls' sporting teams and introduced legislation to ban trans girls from participating.[78]\n\n\nIn response to the Supreme Court's decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, which found a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Capito said, \"While I would have preferred that the Supreme Court leave this decision to the states, it is my hope that all West Virginians will move forward and continue to care for and respect one another.\"[79] In November 2022, Capito was one of 12 Republicans voting to advance legislation, the Respect for Marriage Act, to codify same-sex marriage into federal law; referring to civil same-sex marriage as a \"civil partnership,\" Capito said that the \"legislation will allow those who have entered into a civil partnership since the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, to continue to have their partnerships respected for federal benefit purposes.\"[80][81][82] She voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act on November 29, 2022.[83][84]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nCapito had described herself as \"pro-choice,\" or pro-abortion rights, but has a mixed record on abortion.[85][86][87][88] She had previously been among the few Republican senators who publicly supported *Roe v. Wade*, the Supreme Court decision ruling abortion bans unconstitutional.[89][90][91][92] But in 2020, she declared her support for March for Life, an anti-abortion movement,[93] and in 2022, she reversed her position on *Roe*, saying she believes states should be free to ban abortion.[94][95] She supports legal abortion in cases when the pregnant patient's health is at risk and said abortions should be rare.[96] She has mixed ratings from anti-abortion organizations opposing abortion and abortion rights organizations advocating legal abortion.[97][98] In 2002, her third-largest contributor was The WISH List, an abortion rights PAC.[99] In 2000, she received support from Republicans for Choice.[100] She has been endorsed by West Virginians for Life, an anti-abortion PAC, the WISH List, and by Republican Majority for Choice, an abortion rights PAC.[101][102][103]\n\n\nCapito voted against federal funding for abortion and for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, but against banning family-planning funding in US aid. She previously opposed the Hyde Amendment, but now supports it.[104][105] She supported federal funding for family planning in the House[106] but voted to require parental consent for minors seeking an abortion.[107] She opposed banning funds for mifepristone, the \"abortion pill\".[108] She voted for spending bills funding Planned Parenthood and against a bill to defund it, but has also voted to defund Planned Parenthood.[109][110][111][112] She is against bans on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy,[113] but supports banning abortion after 20 weeks.[114] She voted with her party in 2018 to ban federal funding for facilities that promote abortion.[115] Capito supports other anti-abortion legislation supported by her party.[116][117][118][119][120][121] In 2021, she signed a letter put forward by the Senate's anti-abortion caucus opposing the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and opposing legislation to liberalize current federal abortion laws.[122][123][124]\n\n\nIn 2017, \"West Virginians for Life, said [it] still supports Capito, despite the abortion rights self-identification and support for Roe v. Wade, because of Capito's steadfast voting record restricting abortions and defunding Planned Parenthood\".[125] In 2018, Capito said she was neutral on an initiative to ban abortion in West Virginia.[126] She supported Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh; when asked about *Roe*, Capito said she does not think the court will overturn the ruling. \"Fundamentally, it's been a precedent for a long time,\" she said.[127][128] Capito also supported Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.[129] Barrett signed a letter calling for the end of *Roe v. Wade,* and supported a group that holds that life begins at fertilization.[130][131] In 2020, Capito declined to sign an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to reconsider *Roe*.[132][133][134] Also in 2021, she was one of just three Senate Republicans (with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski) to decline to sign amicus briefs in the Mississippi case that seeks to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.[135] Asked about a 2022 draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn *Roe v. Wade*, reportedly joined by Barrett, Kavanaugh, and Neil Gorsuch, all of whom Capito voted to confirm, she responded by criticizing the leak of the draft and said, \"this is a draft opinion that is not binding Supreme Court precedent. *Roe* still remains the law of the land until the Supreme Court issues its final ruling.\"[136][137][138] After the Supreme Court overturned *Roe* in the *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* decision, Capito said she supported the court's decision and believed the issue should be decided at the state level.[139][140] In September 2022, Capito said she was opposed to a national 15-week abortion ban proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.[141][142][143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Sexual assault[edit]\n\n\nCapito is partnering with Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand, Patty Murray, Amy Klobuchar and other bipartisan members of Congress to update the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995.[145] In August 2018, She and Senator Joe Manchin announced $899,927 for the West Virginia Foundation for Rape Information and Services through the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women.[146]\n\n\n\n#### Embryonic stem-cell research[edit]\n\n\nCapito supports embryonic stem cell research. In 2001, Capito voted for a bill to ban the cloning of human embryos.[147] In May 2005, as a representative, Capito broke with her party, voting with a majority of Democrats, to repeal restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research funding.[148] Capito also voted in 2006 to attempt to override President Bush's veto of the 2005 bill.[147] Also in 2007, Capito again voted in favor of funding stem-cell research.[147] She also voted in favor of research using stem cells derived from donated embryos.[149] In 2009, Capito voted for a budget bill that prohibited the creation of human embryos for research.[147]\n\n\n\n#### Gun rights[edit]\n\n\nCapito was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) and West Virginia Citizen's Defense League which both support gun owners' rights in 2014.[150] In 2016, she voted in favor of alerting law enforcement when a person suspected of terrorism attempts to purchase a firearm and in favor of an amendment to improve the National Instant Background Check System, but she voted against two other gun control amendments.[151] In 2018, Capito opposed President Trump's suggestion that teachers be armed, saying, \"I don't think a teacher should carry a gun in a classroom.\"[152] In January 2019, she was one of 31 Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz that would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state's laws.[153] Capito said she was open to supporting red flag laws.[154] As of 2020, the NRA has given her a rating of 92%, for supporting their positions, and Gun Owners of America gives her a 69% rating.[155]\n\n\n\n#### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nAs a representative, Capito opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act). Since then, she had voted repeatedly to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[156] In July 2017, Capito opposed repealing the ACA without a replacement proposal, and was one of three Republican senators, along with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who blocked a bill to repeal the ACA without a replacement early in the attempted repeal process.[157] Later that July, she voted to repeal the ACA.[158]\n\n\nCapito was one of a few Republicans who broke with their party in favor of the State Children's Health Insurance Program.[159] In January 2009, she voted to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as part of its reauthorization. The expanded coverage would include about four million more children in the program.[160] In May 2008, Capito voted for the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (commonly called the new G.I. Bill), which expanded the educational benefits for military veterans who have served since September 11, 2001.[161] During the 112th Congress, she voted for H.R. 525 to expand the ACA grant programs.[162] In 2014, she supported repealing the Affordable Care Act.[163]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2017, Capito supported preserving the ACA's Medicaid expansion in any GOP bill to repeal it .[164] With three other Republicans, she signed a letter opposing the House plan to repeal the ACA.[165][166] She opposed the Better Care Reconciliation Act because of her opposition to an amendment to the bill as well as over opioid issues.[167][168] She was one of seven Republicans who voted against repealing the ACA without a replacement.[169][170][171]\n\n\nIn 2018, Capito voted for the bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act to address the nation's opioid crisis.[172][173] She also voted to increase Telemedicine funding in five West Virginia counties.[174]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Capito cosponsored the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, a bipartisan bill that would continue federal funding of community health centers and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) beyond that year's September 30 deadline for five years and provide both with yearly federal funding increases beginning in fiscal year 2020.[175] In 2021, she announced support for increasing funding for virtual healthcare options, and she co-sponsored bipartisan legislation to expand seniors' access to Telehealth, with \"virtual [healthcare] visits.\"[176] She supports extending Medicare to cover therapies to prevent diabetes.[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nCapito has said that she does not support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but voted against a 2004 bill that would have forced hospitals to report undocumented immigrants; she also voted for a 2001 bill to allow some immigrants to \"remain in the country while pursuing residency\".[179] In 2010, she voted against the DREAM Act.[180] In 2018, Capito said of DACA and immigration, \"It's probably going to be some sort of legal status for DACA recipients that gives them the permanence of legal status and then the border security\".[181] Of her views on DACA, Capito's office said that she \"could support an immigration solution that provides for increased border security to protect Americans and provides relief for those in the DACA program. She is encouraged by ongoing negotiations between the Trump Administration and members of Congress to improve immigration policy and add resources for enforcement.\"[182]\n\n\nIn 2018, Capito voted to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, voted against the McCain-Coons proposal to offer a pathway to citizenship without funding for a border wall, against Senator Collins's bipartisan bill to increase funding for border security and offer a pathway to citizenship, and in favor of Trump's proposal to offer a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants while reducing legal immigration numbers and using federal funds to build a border wall.[183] In December 2018, Capito supported a bipartisan compromise funding bill that would have allocated $1.6 billion, instead of the $5 billion Trump requested, for a border wall to avoid a government shutdown.[184]\n\n\nCapito voiced disagreement with Trump's \"zero-tolerance\" policy that included separating children from their parents or guardians. She said, \"we need to keep the families together\".[185] In 2019, she supported legislation to increase funding and humanitarian aid for \"relief and comfort for migrants\" on the US southern border.[186] She also voted in committee for a bipartisan plan with $4.6 billion in funding with \"$2.9 billion for the care of migrant children and $1.3 billion to improve facilities at the border\".[187]\n\n\nSpecial interest groups for and against immigration reform have given Capito mixed ratings. NumbersUSA, which opposes illegal immigration and seeks to reduce legal immigration, gave her an 81% score and the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which also opposes illegal immigration and wants to reduce legal immigration, gave her an 88% score; conversely, the Hispanic Federation and UnidosUS, which both support immigration, gave Capito a 59% rating.[150]\n\n\n\n#### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito disagreed with U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions's 2018 memo on marijuana-related prosecutions, saying, \"I'm going to go on the record as saying I'm against recreational marijuana, but I respect the states' rights to make that decision\".[188] She also said that she had concerns, but accepted and supported the legalization of medical marijuana.[189] She received a 42% rating from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, which supports the decriminalization of marijuana.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito has received at lifetime rating of 17% from the League of Conservation Voters, indicating an anti-environment voting record.[190] In 2018, she voted for a bill that would curtail the federal government's ability to regulate fracking. She has also voted to restrict the Department of the Interior's ability to regulate methane emissions.[191]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Capito was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"[192] In 2020, she cosponsored legislation with fellow West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin to \"enhance a tax credit that Congress expanded in 2018 to spur investment in carbon capture technology.\"[193]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito has sponsored approximately 40 bills about international trade and international finance, the most of any other legislative topic during her career.[194] She criticized the vulnerabilities in national security policy in the wake of the 2015 San Bernardino attack[195] and has sponsored eight bills on the military and national security.[194] Capito was one of 47 Republican senators to sign Senator Tom Cotton's open letter to the Iranian government in 2015.[196] The letter, which sought to dissuade Iran from reaching an agreement with President Barack Obama on nuclear peace, was described by the White House as \"undercutting foreign policy\".[197]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Capito co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[198][199]\n\n\nOn foreign policy, the *National Journal* gave her a score of 77% conservative and 15% liberal.[43]\n\n\n\n#### International trade[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Capito voted against the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), the major trade agreement negotiated under President George W. Bush. In 2003, 2004, and 2007, she voted to approve free trade agreements with Chile, Singapore, Australia, and Peru. She supports tariffs against countries that manipulate currencies, and she sponsored a bill that would create an import fee on countries with an undervalued currency.[43]\n\n\n\n### Interior policy[edit]\n\n\nCapito supports the Republican Main Street Partnership's motion to elevate the EPA to be a Cabinet-level department, which would bring more oversight to the entity.[200]\n\n\nCapito opposes legislation aimed at capping greenhouse gas emissions.[201] In January 2010, she reportedly asked the president if he would reconsider \"job-killing\" policies like limiting greenhouse gases.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)Capito meets with President Biden in the Oval Office during discussions about an infrastructure bill.\nIn March 2011, Capito and other members of West Virginia's House delegation co-sponsored a campaign to allow the remains of the last American living veteran of World War I, Frank Buckles, to lie in state at the Capitol rotunda. The move, requested by Buckles's family, had been blocked by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner. Reid and Boehner supported a special ceremony at the Arlington National Cemetery. Capito said, \"This is a matter close to the hearts of many West Virginians, but everyone can appreciate the desire to come together one last time to respect and remember America’s last doughboy\". The campaign was unsuccessful and Buckles lay in honor at the Arlington National Cemetery.[203]\n\n\nCapito supported Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. She called the decision \"the right decision for the American economy and workers in West Virginia and across the country.\"[204] She supports regulations implemented by the EPA, based on her bipartisan legislation, to increase clean water standards.[205]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, the fiscally conservative PAC the Club for Growth gave her a 50% lifetime rating.[97] In 2011, while in the House, Capito voted for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution.[206] In 2020, she said she opposed cuts to government spending, but also opposed any increases.[207]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Capito voted to extend the tax cuts enacted during the administration of President George W. Bush.[208]\n\n\nCapito supports a federal prohibition on online poker. In 2006, she cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act.[209] She also supported H.R. 4411, the Goodlatte-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.[210] In June 2003, Capito introduced the Family Fairness in Taxing Act of 2003, which would accelerate the increase to the child tax credit, increase the qualification age for children, and revise refundability criteria for the credit.[211]\n\n\nIn 2001, Capito voted in favor of the Bush tax cuts.[212] In 2002, she supported partially privatizing Social Security but opposed complete privatization.[213] In 2006, Capito joined Democrats to vote for an increase of the minimum wage.[214] In 2012, during her campaign for the Senate, the Senate Conservative Fund opposed her nomination because \"her spending record in the House is too liberal\".[215] In 2013, she voted against cutting funding for food stamps.[216] In 2017, Capito opposed President Trump's proposed budget, saying that it would cut \"too close to the bone\".[217] In 2017, she said she supported full repeal of the inheritance tax.[218] She also voted in favor of Trump's tax cut bill.[219] In 2019, she came out against budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.[220] Capito was among a few Republicans, including Joni Ernst of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine, to express criticism of Trump's nominee to the Federal Reserve, Stephen Moore, because of comments he had made about women; he ultimately withdrew the nomination.[221][222][223] In 2019, Capito announced support for paid family leave.[224] In 2020, she opposed budget cuts due to the \"spending needs\" of states like West Virginia.[225] On September 30, 2021, she was among 15 Senate Republicans to vote with all Democrats and both Independents for a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown.[226][227] On October 7, 2021, she was one of 11 Republicans voting with all members of the Democratic caucus to end a filibuster on raising the debt ceiling,[228][229] but voted against the bill to raise the debt ceiling.[230] On August 10, 2021, Capito was one of 19 Senate Republicans to vote with the Democratic caucus in favor of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[231] On economic issues, the *National Journal* gave her a rating of 53% conservative and 47% liberal.[43]\n\n\n\n### Judiciary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capito meets with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, July 2018\nCapito opposed having a hearing for President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, to the Supreme Court due to the nomination's proximity to the 2016 presidential election.[232] In 2017, she voted to confirm President Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.[233] After Trump nominated a second justice, Capito announced her support for the nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and after he was accused of sexual assault, she continued to support his nomination.[233] But she also said she considered the allegation serious and was among a handful of Republican senators to ask for a vote to be delayed in order to hear from the accuser and from Kavanaugh.[234] Some of her fellow alumnae from the Holton-Arms School personally delivered her a letter signed by more than a thousand alumnae of the school, saying that they believe Kavanaugh's accuser because her allegations are \"all too consistent with stories we heard and lived\" while attending Holton-Arms.[235]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Capito was one of 12 senators to cosponsor a resolution that would impose a constitutional amendment limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices. The resolution was introduced after multiple Democratic presidential candidates expressed openness to the idea of expanding the seats on the Supreme Court.[236]\n\n\nIn September 2020, less than two months before the next presidential election, Capito supported an immediate vote on Trump's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. In March 2016, she took the opposite position when facing Obama's nominee, saying that a justice should not be considered during a presidential election year because \"West Virginians and the American people should have the ability to weigh in at the ballot box\".[237] As of November 2021, Capito had a mixed voting record on Biden's judicial nominees.[238][239][240][241]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidential speculation[edit]\n\n\nCapito was considered a possible contender for vice president on the Republican ticket with Donald Trump in 2016,[242][243] and in May 2016 she was one of several senators to meet with Trump in Washington, D.C.[244] In the end, Trump picked Indiana Governor and former U.S. Representative Mike Pence to join him on the Republican ticket.\n\n\n\n## Electoral

Capito, and they have three children: sons Charles and Moore, and daughter Shelley.[264] Her father served over two years in prison on corruption charges. Her sister, Lucy Moore Durbin, was arrested in 1992 along with her husband for selling cocaine to an undercover officer.[265] Capito and the Moore Capito family are members of First Presbyterian Church in Charleston, West Virginia, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (USA).[266][267][268]\n\n\nIn September 2015, *Runner's World* featured Capito in its \"I'm a Runner\" vlog, where she states she has been a distance runner for over 30 years.[269]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Livingston, Abby (July 9, 2014). \"Shelley Moore Capito Campaigns Amid Father's Complicated Legacy\". *Roll Call*.

A member of the Democratic Party and regarded as a progressive,[2] Warren has focused on consumer protection, equitable economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.[3][4][5]\n\n\nWarren's first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals.[6][7] During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama.[8]\n\n\nIn 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts.[9] She won re-election by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl.[10] On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.[11] She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren's high school graduation photo\nWarren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[13][14][15][16] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker,[17] and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church.[18] Warren has described her early family life as teetering \"on the ragged edge of the middle class\" and \"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.\"[19][20] She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.[21][22]\n\n\nWarren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City.[20] When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward,[20] had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work.[15] After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building.[23] Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears.[15] When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.[24][25]\n\n\nWarren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16.[15] She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert \"Jim\" Warren,[26] whom she had met in high school.[15][24][27]\n\n\nWarren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM.[15][28] She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology.[23][29]\n\n\nThe Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia.[15][19][30] After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled at Rutgers Law School.[30] She received her Juris Doctor in 1976 and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter.[27][30] Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.[15][19]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school.[31] During law school, she worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. After receiving her Juris Doctor and passing the bar examination, Warren offered legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.[27][30]\n\n\nIn the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance.[30] She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\n### Academic[edit]\n\n\nWarren began her career in academia as a lecturer at Rutgers University, Newark School of Law (1977–1978). She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978–1983), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987[29] and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school.[21][32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Warren in University of Texas School of Law's 1987 yearbook.\nWarren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the *Notre Dame Law Review*, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted.[33] But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law.[34] According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts.[35] Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book *As We Forgive Our Debtors* in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \"worse than disillusionment\" and \"like being shocked at a deep-down level\".[33] In 2004, she published an article in the *Washington University Law Review* in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.[36]\n\n\nWarren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as the Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996, she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions.[37][29] As of 2011[update], she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university.[34] Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009, Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields.[38][39]\n\n\nShe began to rise in prominence in 2004 with an appearance on the Dr. Phil show, and published several books including *The Two-Income Trap*.[40]\n\n\n\n### Advisory roles[edit]\n\n\nIn 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years.[41] She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy.[24][42]\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion.[43] She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law,[44] a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[45]\n\n\nWarren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.[46][47]**: 1315**\n\n\n\n### TARP oversight[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren stands next to President Barack Obama as he announces Richard Cordray's nomination as the first director of the CFPB, July 2011.\nOn November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate majority leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.[48] The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs.[49] During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n### Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren discussing the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the ICBA conference in 2011\nWarren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency.[53] While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator.[24][54][55] Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director,[56] in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators' objections.[57][58]\n\n\n\n### Political affiliation[edit]\n\n\nA close high-school friend told *Politico* in 2019 that in high school Warren was a \"diehard conservative\" and that she had since done a \"180-degree turn and an about-face\".[33] One of her colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin said that at university in the early 1980s Warren was \"sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude\".[33] Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \"almost fell off [his] chair... She's definitely changed\".[33] Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996[1] and voted Republican for many years. \"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\", she has said.[15] But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford.[33]\n\n\nWarren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed neither should dominate.[59] According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.[60][61]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Electoral history of Elizabeth Warren\n\n![](image)2012 Senate election results by municipality\n![](image)Senate campaign logo\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Massachusetts\n\nOn September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate. Republican Scott Brown had won the seat in a 2010 special election after Ted Kennedy's death.[62][63] A week later, a video of Warren speaking in Andover went viral on the Internet.[64] In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \"class warfare\" by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society:[65][66]\n\n\n\n\n> There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. ... You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea. God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.\n> \n> \n\n\nPresident Obama later echoed her sentiments in a 2012 election campaign speech.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)Warren at a campaign event, November 2012\nWarren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates.[68][69][70] She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented that \"no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren\".[71] Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to *The New York Times*, \"that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win\".[56]\n\n\nWarren received a prime-time speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that \"has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered\". According to Warren, \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\" Warren said Wall Street CEOs \"wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\" and that they \"still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them\".[72][73][74]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Massachusetts\n\nOn January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, writing, \"The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.\"[75]\n\n\nIn the 2018 election, Warren defeated Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, 60% to 36%.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts,[13] as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 women senators in office, which was the most in Senate history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry.[76] Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.[77]\n\n\nAt Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, \"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\" Videos of Warren's questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days.[78] At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: \"If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.\"[79][80]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Warren sent letters to the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court.[81] Also in May, saying that students should get \"the same great deal that banks get\", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%.[82] Independent senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill, saying: \"The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn't\".[83]\n\n\nDuring the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016.[84][85][86][87]\n\n\n\nWarren's \"A minimum-wage job saved my family\" speech at the Economic Policy Institute, November 2015 (3:28)\nIn early 2015, President Obama urged Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement between the United States and 11 Asian and South American countries.[88] Warren criticized the TPP, arguing that the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement and labor protections for American workers therein were insufficient; her objections were in turn criticized by Obama.[89][90]\n\n\nSaying \"despite the progress we've made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy\", in July 2015 Warren, John McCain, Maria Cantwell, and Angus King reintroduced the 21st Century Glass–Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer's risk in the financial system and the likelihood of future financial crises.[91]\n\n\nIn a September 20, 2016, hearing, Warren called on Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to resign, adding that he should be \"criminally investigated\" over Wells Fargo's opening of two million checking and credit-card accounts without the customers' consent.[92][93]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which *The Boston Globe* called \"a high-profile perch on one of the chamber's most powerful committees\" that would \"fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president\".[94]\n\n\nDuring the debate on Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination for United States attorney general in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter Coretta Scott King had written Senator Strom Thurmond in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship.[95] King wrote, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\"[95] Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated Senate Rule 19, which prohibits impugning another senator's character.[95] This prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions's nomination, and Warren instead read King's letter while streaming live online.[96][97] In rebuking Warren, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor, \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\"[97] McConnell's language became a slogan for Warren and others.[97][98]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2017, during Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy J. Sloan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Warren called on him to resign, saying, \"At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.\"[99]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2019, Warren and Representative Al Lawson introduced legislation that would make low-income college students eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to the College Student Hunger Act of 2019.[100]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Warren was named a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury in the Biden Administration.[101]\n\n\nWarren was at the Capitol to participate in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the Capitol. She called it an \"attempted coup and act of insurrection egged on by a corrupt president to overthrow our democracy\", and the perpetrators \"domestic terrorists.\"[102] The day after the attack, Warren joined the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation to call for Trump's immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment.[103]\n\n\n\n### Role in the 2016 presidential election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren stumps for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire, October 2016\nIn the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election, supporters put Warren forward as a possible presidential candidate, but she repeatedly said she would not run for president in 2016.[104][105][106][107] In October 2013, she joined the other 15 women Democratic senators in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run.[108] There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate.[109][110] On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted.[111] On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person short list to be Clinton's running mate.[111][112] Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.\n\n\nUntil her June endorsement, Warren was neutral during the Democratic primary but made public statements that she was cheering Bernie Sanders on.[113] In June, Warren endorsed and campaigned for Clinton.[114] She called Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, dishonest, uncaring, and \"a loser\".[115][116][117]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### Current[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services[118]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities\n\t+ Subcommittee on Personnel (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Strategic Forces\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[119]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* Committee on Finance[120]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight\n* Special Committee on Aging\n\n\n#### Previous[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (2015-2017)\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2013-2021)\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren while formally declaring her candidacy in Lawrence, Massachusetts on February 9, 2019\nMain articles: Elizabeth Warren 2020 presidential campaign and 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on September 29, 2018, Warren said she would \"take a hard look\" at running for president in the 2020 election after the 2018 United States elections concluded.[121] On December 31, 2018, Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president.[122][123]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike.[124] A longtime critic of President Trump, Warren called him a \"symptom of a larger problem [that has resulted in] a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else\".[125]\n\n\nWarren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including working class families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government:\n\n\n\n\n> It won't be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration. We can't afford to just tinker around the edges—a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change. This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing her candidacy announcement, Warren became known for the number and depth of her policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, several proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, a plan to utilize economic patriotism, and plans to address opioid addiction.[126][127] One of her signature plans was a wealth tax, dubbed the \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax\", on fortunes over $50 million.[128] Warren was credited with popularizing the idea of a wealth tax with Americans, leading competitor Bernie Sanders to release a wealth tax plan.[129]\n\n\nAfter several defeats at the polls, including the Democratic primary in her home state of Massachusetts, Warren ended her campaign on March 5, 2020.[130]\n\n\n\n### Polls[edit]\n\n\nIn early June 2019, Warren placed second in some polls, with Joe Biden in first place and Bernie Sanders in third.[127] In the following weeks her poll numbers steadily increased, and a September Iowa poll placed her in the lead with 22% to Biden's 20%. The Iowa poll also rated the number of voters at least considering voting for each candidate; Warren scored 71% to Biden's 60%. Poll respondents also gave her a higher \"enthusiasm\" rating, with 32% of her backers extremely enthusiastic to Biden's 22%.[131]\n\n\nAn October 24 Quinnipiac poll placed Warren in the lead at 28%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 15%. When asked which candidate had the best policy ideas, 30% of respondents named Warren, with Sanders at 20% and Biden 15%. Sanders was most often named as the candidate who \"cares most about people like you,\" with Warren in second place and Biden third. Sanders also placed first at 28% when respondents were asked which candidate was the most honest, followed by Warren and Biden at 15% each.[132]\n\n\n\n### Funding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Selfie line for Elizabeth Warren after a May 19, 2019, campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire.\nThe *Los Angeles Times* reported that of the front-runners in the presidential race, only Sanders and Warren have previously won an election with almost exclusively small online contributions, and that no presidential primary in recent history has had two of the top three candidates refuse to use bundlers or hold private fundraisers with wealthy donors.[133][134]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Warren said that she took no PAC money.[135] In October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.[136]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Warren's campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders's campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million. Warren's average donation was $26; Sanders's was $18.[137]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Warren began accepting support from Super PACs, after failing to convince other Democratic presidential candidates to join her in disavowing them.[138][139]\n\n\n\n### Public appearances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A crowd of 20,000 attended Warren's rally in Washington Square Park\nAs of September 2019, Warren had attended 128 town halls. She is known for remaining afterward to talk with audience members and for the large numbers of selfies she has taken with them.[133] On September 17, over 20,000 people attended a Warren rally at New York City's Washington Square Park. After her speech long lines formed with people waiting as long as four hours for selfies.[140]\n\n\nDue to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Warren was unable to make final campaign stops in person and opted to send her dog, Bailey Warren, to meet with voters in Iowa.[141]\n\n\n\n### Vice-presidential speculation[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, CNN reported that Warren was among the top four vice-presidential choices for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, along with Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Representative Val Demings, and Senator Kamala Harris.[142] Kamala Harris was officially announced as Biden's running mate on August 11, 2020. On August 13, *The New York Times* reported that Warren was one of Biden's four finalists along with Harris, Susan Rice, and Gretchen Whitmer.[143]\n\n\nIn late April, CNBC reported that big-money donors were pressuring Biden not to choose Warren, preferring other candidates purportedly on his list, such as Harris, Whitmer, and Amy Klobuchar.[144]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWarren and her first husband divorced in 1978,[15][19] and two years later, Warren married law professor Bruce H. Mann on July 12, 1980,[145] but kept her first husband's surname.[19][146] Warren has three grandchildren through her daughter Amelia.[147]\n\n\nOn April 23, 2020, Warren announced on Twitter that her eldest brother, Don Reed Herring, had died of COVID-19 two days earlier.[148][149] On October 1, 2021, she announced that her brother, John Herring, had died of cancer.[150]\n\n\nAs of 2019, according to Forbes Magazine, Warren's net worth was $12 million.[151][152]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Elizabeth Warren\n\n![](image)Warren with a supporter wearing a \"Warren has a plan for that\" T-shirt. The phrase became an internet meme during her presidential run.[153]\nWarren is widely regarded as a progressive. In 2012, the British magazine *New Statesman* named Warren among the \"top 20 U.S. progressives\".[154]\n\n\nWarren supports worker representation on corporations' board of directors, breaking up monopolies, stiffening sentences for white-collar crime, a Medicare for All plan to provide health insurance for all Americans, and a higher minimum wage.[155]\n\n\nWarren was highly critical of the Trump administration. She expressed concerns over what she says were Trump's conflicts of interest. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017.[156][157] Warren was highly critical of Trump's immigration policies. In 2018, she called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[158]\n\n\nWarren has criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in support of Yemen's government against the Houthis.[159][160] In January 2019, Warren criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She agreed that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a \"coordinated\" plan formed with U.S. allies.[161]\n\n\nIn April 2019, after reading the Mueller report, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, \"The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\"[162]\n\n\nAfter the June 24, 2022, ruling in which the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*, Warren wrote a *New York Times* op-ed requesting that President Biden unblock \"critical resources and authority that states and the federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health services\".[163]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2023, Warren presented a detailed analysis of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023, and provided possible solutions to avoid further bank failures, in *The New York Times*.[164]\n\n\n\n## Ancestry and Native American issues[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had some Native American ancestry.[165][166] In 2012, she said that \"being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born\".[167] In 1984,[168][169] Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as Cherokee.[170][171]\n\n\nDuring Warren's first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that she had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren's ancestry in several attack ads.[172][173][174] Warren has denied that her alleged heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career.[175] Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring.[176][177] From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this.[178]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as \"American Indian\" on a State Bar of Texas write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was \"no indication it was used for professional advancement\".[179] A 2018 *Boston Globe* investigation found that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession, and concluded there was \"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools\", and that \"Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her\".[180] In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American.[171][181][182]\n\n\nThroughout his presidency, former president Donald Trump mocked Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry,[183] and pejoratively called her \"Pocahontas\".[184] At a July 2018 Montana rally, he promised that if he debated Warren, he would pay $1 million to her favorite charity if she took a DNA test and \"it shows you're an Indian\".[185] In October 2018, Warren released an analysis of a DNA test by geneticist Carlos D. Bustamante that found her ancestry to be mostly European but \"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\", likely \"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago\".[186] Other geneticists, while not disputing the test's validity, found the underlying science \"flawed\" due to the lack of Native Americans in the United States in the database.[187] Geneticists Krystal Tsosie and Matthew Anderson called the interpretation of the test \"problematic\", citing, among other reasons, \"Warren's motives, and the genetic variants informing the comparison\". They added: \"because Bustamante used Indigenous individuals from Central and South America as a reference group to compare Warren's DNA, we believe he should have stated only that Warren potentially had an 'Indigenous' ancestor 6-10 generations ago, not conclusively a 'Native American' one. The distinction might seem hypercritical to most, but to the sovereign tribal nations of the United States it's an important one.\"[188]\n\n\nAfter publicizing Bustamante's interpretation of the test, Warren asked Trump to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Trump responded: \"I didn't say that. I think you better read it again\".[185][189][190] The Cherokee Nation called the use of DNA testing to determine Native American heritage \"inappropriate and wrong\".[177][191] According to *Politico*, \"Warren's past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle\", with \"tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.\"[184]\n\n\nDuring a January 2019 public appearance in Sioux City, Iowa, Warren was asked by an attendee, \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?\" She responded in part, \"I am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\"[192] She later privately contacted leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize \"for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused\". Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands \"that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests\".[193] Warren apologized again in August 2019 before a Native American Forum in Iowa.[194][195]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress.[196][197] Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her \"a great partner for Indian Country\".[198]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren at the 2009 *Time* 100 Gala\nIn 2009, *The Boston Globe* named Warren the Bostonian of the Year[23] and the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts honored her with the Lelia J. Robinson Award.[199] *The National Law Journal* has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America,[200][201] and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade.[202] Also in 2009, Warren became the first professor in Harvard's history to win the law school's Sacks–Freund Teaching Award for a second time.[203] In 2011, she delivered the commencement address at Rutgers Law School, her alma mater, and received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the Order of the Coif.[204] In 2011, Warren was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.[205] In January 2012, *New Statesman* magazine named her one of the \"top 20 U.S. progressives\".[154] Warren was named one of *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017.[206][207][208][209][210]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Women's History Month theme in the United States was \"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\", referring to McConnell's remark about Warren.[211]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* Warren has appeared in the documentary films *Maxed Out* (2007), Michael Moore's *Capitalism: A Love Story* (2009), *Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?* (2011), and *Makers: Women Who Make America* (2013).[212][213][214]\n* In 2017, Kate McKinnon played Warren on *Saturday Night Live*. McKinnon continued her impression of Warren in 2019 and 2020, during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[215][216] On the March 7, 2020, episode, Warren appeared as herself in the cold open alongside McKinnon's impression of her, and together they opened the show.[217]\n* In 2019, Warren wrote the entry on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for that year's *Time* 100.[218]\n* Warren's popularity is the basis of a wide array of merchandise sold in her name, much of which incorporates Mitch McConnell's remark \"Nevertheless, she persisted\",[219] including an action figure of Warren.[220]\n* Musician Jonathan Mann has written songs about Warren, including \"She Persisted\".[221][222]\n\n\n## Political protégés[edit]\n\n\nWarren has mentored several people who have gone on to hold notable political office. U.S. Representative Katie Porter, a former law student of Warren's, is considered a protégée of Warren.[223] Porter co-chaired Warren's presidential campaign.[224] Another of Warren's political protégés is Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who was a law student of Warren's and worked on her 2012 Senate campaign before running for Boston City Council herself in 2013.[225][226][227] Suffolk County Sheriff Steven W. Tompkins got his start in politics working on Warren's 2012 Senate campaign.[228] During his law school career, former U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III considered Warren a mentor.[229] A number of Warren acolytes serve in the Biden administration, including Bharat Ramamurti (a former economic policy advisor to Warren).[230]\n\n\n\n## Books and other works[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote *The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke*. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.[231]\n\n\nIn an article in *The New York Times*, Jeff Madrick said of the book:\n\n\n\n\n>  The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children ... their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.[232] \n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills[233] that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance.[234] The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.[235]\n\n\nMetropolitan Books published Warren's book *A Fighting Chance* in April 2014.[236] According to a *Boston Globe* review, \"the book's title refers to a time she says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.\"[237]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Warren published her 11th book,[4] *This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class*, in which she explores the plight of the American middle class and argues that the federal government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education.[238]\n\n\n\nPublications\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Selected articles* Warren, Elizabeth (1987). \"Bankruptcy Policy\". *The University of Chicago Law Review*. **54** (3): 775–814. doi:10.2307/1599826.

A member of the Democratic Party and regarded as a progressive,[2] Warren has focused on consumer protection, equitable economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.[3][4][5]\n\n\nWarren's first foray into public policy began in 1995, when she worked to oppose what eventually became a 2005 act restricting bankruptcy access for individuals.[6][7] During the late 2000s, her national profile grew after her forceful public stances in favor of more stringent banking regulations after the financial crisis of 2007–2008. She served as chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and proposed and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for which she served as the first special advisor under President Barack Obama.[8]\n\n\nIn 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts.[9] She won re-election by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl.[10] On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.[11] She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren's high school graduation photo\nWarren was born Elizabeth Ann Herring in Oklahoma City on June 22, 1949.[13][14][15][16] She is the fourth child of Pauline Louise (née Reed, 1912–1995), a homemaker,[17] and Donald Jones Herring (1911–1997), a U.S. Army flight instructor during World War II, both of whom were members of the evangelical branch of the Protestant Methodist Church.[18] Warren has described her early family life as teetering \"on the ragged edge of the middle class\" and \"kind of hanging on at the edges by our fingernails.\"[19][20] She and her three older brothers were raised Methodist.[21][22]\n\n\nWarren lived in Norman, Oklahoma, until she was 11 years old, when her family moved back to Oklahoma City.[20] When she was 12, her father, then a salesman at Montgomery Ward,[20] had a heart attack, which led to many medical bills as well as a pay cut because he could not do his previous work.[15] After leaving his sales job, he worked as a maintenance man for an apartment building.[23] Eventually, the family's car was repossessed because they failed to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog-order department at Sears.[15] When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.[24][25]\n\n\nWarren became a star member of the debate team at Northwest Classen High School and won the state high school debating championship. She also won a debate scholarship to George Washington University (GWU) at the age of 16.[15] She initially aspired to be a teacher, but left GWU after two years in 1968 to marry James Robert \"Jim\" Warren,[26] whom she had met in high school.[15][24][27]\n\n\nWarren and her husband moved to Houston, where he was employed by IBM.[15][28] She enrolled in the University of Houston and graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in speech pathology and audiology.[23][29]\n\n\nThe Warrens moved to New Jersey when Jim received a job transfer. She soon became pregnant and decided to stay at home to care for their daughter, Amelia.[15][19][30] After Amelia turned two, Warren enrolled at Rutgers Law School.[30] She received her Juris Doctor in 1976 and passed the bar examination shortly thereafter.[27][30] Shortly before graduating, Warren became pregnant with their second child, Alexander.[15][19]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, after obtaining a degree in speech pathology and audiology, but before enrolling in law school, Warren taught children with disabilities for a year in a public school.[31] During law school, she worked as a summer associate at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. After receiving her Juris Doctor and passing the bar examination, Warren offered legal services from home, writing wills and doing real estate closings.[27][30]\n\n\nIn the late 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Warren taught law at several American universities while researching issues related to bankruptcy and middle-class personal finance.[30] She became involved with public work in bankruptcy regulation and consumer protection in the mid-1990s.\n\n\n\n### Academic[edit]\n\n\nWarren began her career in academia as a lecturer at Rutgers University, Newark School of Law (1977–1978). She then moved to the University of Houston Law Center (1978–1983), where she became an associate dean in 1980 and obtained tenure in 1981. She taught at the University of Texas School of Law as visiting associate professor in 1981 and returned as a full professor two years later (staying from 1983 to 1987). She was a research associate at the Population Research Center of the University of Texas at Austin from 1983 to 1987[29] and was also a visiting professor at the University of Michigan in 1985. During this period, Warren also taught Sunday school.[21][32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Warren in University of Texas School of Law's 1987 yearbook.\nWarren's earliest academic work was heavily influenced by the law and economics movement, which aimed to apply neoclassical economic theory to the study of law with an emphasis on economic efficiency. One of her articles, published in 1980 in the *Notre Dame Law Review*, argued that public utilities were over-regulated and that automatic utility rate increases should be instituted.[33] But Warren soon became a proponent of on-the-ground research into how people respond to laws. Her work analyzing court records and interviewing judges, lawyers, and debtors, established her as a rising star in the field of bankruptcy law.[34] According to Warren and economists who follow her work, one of her key insights was that rising bankruptcy rates were caused not by profligate consumer spending but by middle-class families' attempts to buy homes in good school districts.[35] Warren worked in this field alongside colleagues Teresa A. Sullivan and Jay Westbrook, and the trio published their research in the book *As We Forgive Our Debtors* in 1989. Warren later recalled that she had begun her research believing that most people filing for bankruptcy were either working the system or had been irresponsible in incurring debts, but that she concluded that such abuse was in fact rare and that the legal framework for bankruptcy was poorly designed, describing the way the research challenged her fundamental beliefs as \"worse than disillusionment\" and \"like being shocked at a deep-down level\".[33] In 2004, she published an article in the *Washington University Law Review* in which she argued that correlating middle-class struggles with over-consumption was a fallacy.[36]\n\n\nWarren joined the University of Pennsylvania Law School as a full professor in 1987 and obtained an endowed chair in 1990, becoming the William A. Schnader Professor of Commercial Law. In 1992, she taught for a year at Harvard Law School as the Robert Braucher Visiting Professor of Commercial Law. In 1995, Warren left Penn to become Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 1996, she became the highest-paid professor at Harvard University who was not an administrator, with a $181,300 salary and total compensation of $291,876, including moving expenses and an allowance in lieu of benefits contributions.[37][29] As of 2011[update], she was Harvard's only tenured law professor who had attended law school at an American public university.[34] Warren was a highly influential law professor. She published in many fields, but her expertise was in bankruptcy and commercial law. From 2005 to 2009, Warren was among the three most-cited scholars in those fields.[38][39]\n\n\nShe began to rise in prominence in 2004 with an appearance on the Dr. Phil show, and published several books including *The Two-Income Trap*.[40]\n\n\n\n### Advisory roles[edit]\n\n\nIn 1995, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission's chair, former congressman Mike Synar, asked Warren to advise the commission. Synar had been a debate opponent of Warren's during their school years.[41] She helped draft the commission's report and worked for several years to oppose legislation intended to severely restrict consumers' right to file for bankruptcy. Warren and others opposing the legislation were not successful; in 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which curtailed consumers' ability to file for bankruptcy.[24][42]\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Warren was a member of the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion.[43] She is a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference, an independent organization that advises the U.S. Congress on bankruptcy law,[44] a former vice president of the American Law Institute and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[45]\n\n\nWarren's scholarship and public advocacy were the impetus for establishing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011.[46][47]**: 1315**\n\n\n\n### TARP oversight[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren stands next to President Barack Obama as he announces Richard Cordray's nomination as the first director of the CFPB, July 2011.\nOn November 14, 2008, U.S. Senate majority leader Harry Reid appointed Warren to chair the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.[48] The panel released monthly oversight reports evaluating the government bailout and related programs.[49] During Warren's tenure, these reports covered foreclosure mitigation, consumer and small business lending, commercial real estate, AIG, bank stress tests, the impact of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on the financial markets, government guarantees, the automotive industry and other topics.[50][51][52]\n\n\n\n### Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren discussing the work of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at the ICBA conference in 2011\nWarren was an early advocate for creating a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB to set up the new agency.[53] While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups urged Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, financial institutions and Republican members of Congress strongly opposed her, believing she would be an overly zealous regulator.[24][54][55] Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director,[56] in January 2012, Obama appointed former Ohio attorney general Richard Cordray to the post in a recess appointment over Republican senators' objections.[57][58]\n\n\n\n### Political affiliation[edit]\n\n\nA close high-school friend told *Politico* in 2019 that in high school Warren was a \"diehard conservative\" and that she had since done a \"180-degree turn and an about-face\".[33] One of her colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin said that at university in the early 1980s Warren was \"sometimes surprisingly anti-consumer in her attitude\".[33] Gary L. Francione, who had been a colleague of hers at the University of Pennsylvania, recalled in 2019 that when he heard her speak at the time she was becoming politically prominent, he \"almost fell off [his] chair... She's definitely changed\".[33] Warren was registered as a Republican from 1991 to 1996[1] and voted Republican for many years. \"I was a Republican because I thought that those were the people who best supported markets\", she has said.[15] But she has also said that in the six presidential elections before 1996 she voted for the Republican nominee only once, in 1976, for Gerald Ford.[33]\n\n\nWarren has said that she began to vote Democratic in 1995 because she no longer believed that the Republicans were the party who best supported markets, but she has said she has voted for both parties because she believed neither should dominate.[59] According to Warren, she left the Republican Party because it is no longer \"principled in its conservative approach to economics and to markets\" and is instead tilting the playing field in favor of large financial institutions and against middle-class American families.[60][61]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Electoral history of Elizabeth Warren\n\n![](image)2012 Senate election results by municipality\n![](image)Senate campaign logo\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Massachusetts\n\nOn September 14, 2011, Warren declared her intention to run for the Democratic nomination for the 2012 election in Massachusetts for the U.S. Senate. Republican Scott Brown had won the seat in a 2010 special election after Ted Kennedy's death.[62][63] A week later, a video of Warren speaking in Andover went viral on the Internet.[64] In it, Warren responds to the charge that asking the rich to pay more taxes is \"class warfare\" by saying that no one grew rich in the U.S. without depending on infrastructure paid for by the rest of society:[65][66]\n\n\n\n\n> There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. ... You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it turned into something terrific, or a great idea. God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is, you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.\n> \n> \n\n\nPresident Obama later echoed her sentiments in a 2012 election campaign speech.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)Warren at a campaign event, November 2012\nWarren ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination and won it on June 2, 2012, at the state Democratic convention with a record 95.77% of the votes of delegates.[68][69][70] She encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented that \"no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren\".[71] Warren nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, more than any other Senate candidate in 2012, and showed, according to *The New York Times*, \"that it was possible to run against the big banks without Wall Street money and still win\".[56]\n\n\nWarren received a prime-time speaking slot at the 2012 Democratic National Convention on September 5, 2012. She positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that \"has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered\". According to Warren, \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\" Warren said Wall Street CEOs \"wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\" and that they \"still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them\".[72][73][74]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Massachusetts\n\nOn January 6, 2017, in an email to supporters, Warren announced that she would be running for a second term as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, writing, \"The people of Massachusetts didn't send me to Washington to roll over and play dead while Donald Trump and his team of billionaires, bigots, and Wall Street bankers crush the working people of our Commonwealth and this country. ... This is no time to quit.\"[75]\n\n\nIn the 2018 election, Warren defeated Republican nominee Geoff Diehl, 60% to 36%.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts,[13] as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 women senators in office, which was the most in Senate history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry.[76] Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.[77]\n\n\nAt Warren's first Banking Committee hearing in February 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to say when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and said, \"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'.\" Videos of Warren's questioning amassed more than one million views in a matter of days.[78] At a March Banking Committee hearing, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: \"If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail ... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.\"[79][80]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Warren sent letters to the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve questioning their decisions that settling would be more fruitful than going to court.[81] Also in May, saying that students should get \"the same great deal that banks get\", Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%.[82] Independent senator Bernie Sanders endorsed her bill, saying: \"The only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn't\".[83]\n\n\nDuring the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. After the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, a position created for her. The appointment added to speculation that Warren would run for president in 2016.[84][85][86][87]\n\n\n\nWarren's \"A minimum-wage job saved my family\" speech at the Economic Policy Institute, November 2015 (3:28)\nIn early 2015, President Obama urged Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement between the United States and 11 Asian and South American countries.[88] Warren criticized the TPP, arguing that the dispute resolution mechanism in the agreement and labor protections for American workers therein were insufficient; her objections were in turn criticized by Obama.[89][90]\n\n\nSaying \"despite the progress we've made since 2008, the biggest banks continue to threaten our economy\", in July 2015 Warren, John McCain, Maria Cantwell, and Angus King reintroduced the 21st Century Glass–Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation was intended to reduce the American taxpayer's risk in the financial system and the likelihood of future financial crises.[91]\n\n\nIn a September 20, 2016, hearing, Warren called on Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to resign, adding that he should be \"criminally investigated\" over Wells Fargo's opening of two million checking and credit-card accounts without the customers' consent.[92][93]\n\n\nIn December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which *The Boston Globe* called \"a high-profile perch on one of the chamber's most powerful committees\" that would \"fuel speculation about a possible 2020 bid for president\".[94]\n\n\nDuring the debate on Senator Jeff Sessions's nomination for United States attorney general in February 2017, Warren quoted a letter Coretta Scott King had written Senator Strom Thurmond in 1986 when Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship.[95] King wrote, \"Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to happen.\"[95] Senate Republicans voted that by reading the letter from King, Warren had violated Senate Rule 19, which prohibits impugning another senator's character.[95] This prohibited Warren from further participating in the debate on Sessions's nomination, and Warren instead read King's letter while streaming live online.[96][97] In rebuking Warren, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor, \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\"[97] McConnell's language became a slogan for Warren and others.[97][98]\n\n\nOn October 3, 2017, during Wells Fargo chief executive Timothy J. Sloan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee, Warren called on him to resign, saying, \"At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.\"[99]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2019, Warren and Representative Al Lawson introduced legislation that would make low-income college students eligible for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) according to the College Student Hunger Act of 2019.[100]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Warren was named a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury in the Biden Administration.[101]\n\n\nWarren was at the Capitol to participate in the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count when Trump supporters attacked the Capitol. She called it an \"attempted coup and act of insurrection egged on by a corrupt president to overthrow our democracy\", and the perpetrators \"domestic terrorists.\"[102] The day after the attack, Warren joined the entire Massachusetts Congressional delegation to call for Trump's immediate removal from office through the invocation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution or impeachment.[103]\n\n\n\n### Role in the 2016 presidential election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren stumps for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire, October 2016\nIn the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election, supporters put Warren forward as a possible presidential candidate, but she repeatedly said she would not run for president in 2016.[104][105][106][107] In October 2013, she joined the other 15 women Democratic senators in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run.[108] There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate.[109][110] On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Clinton for president. In response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted.[111] On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person short list to be Clinton's running mate.[111][112] Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.\n\n\nUntil her June endorsement, Warren was neutral during the Democratic primary but made public statements that she was cheering Bernie Sanders on.[113] In June, Warren endorsed and campaigned for Clinton.[114] She called Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, dishonest, uncaring, and \"a loser\".[115][116][117]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n#### Current[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Armed Services[118]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities\n\t+ Subcommittee on Personnel (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Strategic Forces\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[119]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Economic Policy (chair)\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* Committee on Finance[120]\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions, and Family Policy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight\n* Special Committee on Aging\n\n\n#### Previous[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (2015-2017)\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (2013-2021)\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren while formally declaring her candidacy in Lawrence, Massachusetts on February 9, 2019\nMain articles: Elizabeth Warren 2020 presidential campaign and 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n\nAt a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, on September 29, 2018, Warren said she would \"take a hard look\" at running for president in the 2020 election after the 2018 United States elections concluded.[121] On December 31, 2018, Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president.[122][123]\n\n\nOn February 9, 2019, Warren officially announced her candidacy at a rally in Lawrence, Massachusetts, at the site of the 1912 Bread and Roses strike.[124] A longtime critic of President Trump, Warren called him a \"symptom of a larger problem [that has resulted in] a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else\".[125]\n\n\nWarren staged her first campaign event in Lawrence to demonstrate the constituency groups she hopes to appeal to, including working class families, union members, women, and new immigrants. She called for major changes in government:\n\n\n\n\n> It won't be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration. We can't afford to just tinker around the edges—a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big, structural change. This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing her candidacy announcement, Warren became known for the number and depth of her policy proposals, including plans to assist family farms by addressing the advantages held by large agricultural conglomerates, plans to reduce student loan debt and offer free tuition at public colleges, a plan to make large corporations pay more in taxes and better regulate large technology companies, several proposals inspired by opposition to President Trump, a plan to utilize economic patriotism, and plans to address opioid addiction.[126][127] One of her signature plans was a wealth tax, dubbed the \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax\", on fortunes over $50 million.[128] Warren was credited with popularizing the idea of a wealth tax with Americans, leading competitor Bernie Sanders to release a wealth tax plan.[129]\n\n\nAfter several defeats at the polls, including the Democratic primary in her home state of Massachusetts, Warren ended her campaign on March 5, 2020.[130]\n\n\n\n### Polls[edit]\n\n\nIn early June 2019, Warren placed second in some polls, with Joe Biden in first place and Bernie Sanders in third.[127] In the following weeks her poll numbers steadily increased, and a September Iowa poll placed her in the lead with 22% to Biden's 20%. The Iowa poll also rated the number of voters at least considering voting for each candidate; Warren scored 71% to Biden's 60%. Poll respondents also gave her a higher \"enthusiasm\" rating, with 32% of her backers extremely enthusiastic to Biden's 22%.[131]\n\n\nAn October 24 Quinnipiac poll placed Warren in the lead at 28%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 15%. When asked which candidate had the best policy ideas, 30% of respondents named Warren, with Sanders at 20% and Biden 15%. Sanders was most often named as the candidate who \"cares most about people like you,\" with Warren in second place and Biden third. Sanders also placed first at 28% when respondents were asked which candidate was the most honest, followed by Warren and Biden at 15% each.[132]\n\n\n\n### Funding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Selfie line for Elizabeth Warren after a May 19, 2019, campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire.\nThe *Los Angeles Times* reported that of the front-runners in the presidential race, only Sanders and Warren have previously won an election with almost exclusively small online contributions, and that no presidential primary in recent history has had two of the top three candidates refuse to use bundlers or hold private fundraisers with wealthy donors.[133][134]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Warren said that she took no PAC money.[135] In October 2019, Warren announced that her campaign would not accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at banks, large tech companies, private equity firms, or hedge funds, in addition to her previous refusal to accept donations of over $200 from fossil fuel or pharmaceutical executives.[136]\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Warren's campaign raised $24.6 million, just less than the $25.3 million Sanders's campaign raised and well ahead of Joe Biden, the front-runner in the polls, who raised $15.2 million. Warren's average donation was $26; Sanders's was $18.[137]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Warren began accepting support from Super PACs, after failing to convince other Democratic presidential candidates to join her in disavowing them.[138][139]\n\n\n\n### Public appearances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A crowd of 20,000 attended Warren's rally in Washington Square Park\nAs of September 2019, Warren had attended 128 town halls. She is known for remaining afterward to talk with audience members and for the large numbers of selfies she has taken with them.[133] On September 17, over 20,000 people attended a Warren rally at New York City's Washington Square Park. After her speech long lines formed with people waiting as long as four hours for selfies.[140]\n\n\nDue to the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Warren was unable to make final campaign stops in person and opted to send her dog, Bailey Warren, to meet with voters in Iowa.[141]\n\n\n\n### Vice-presidential speculation[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, CNN reported that Warren was among the top four vice-presidential choices for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, along with Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Representative Val Demings, and Senator Kamala Harris.[142] Kamala Harris was officially announced as Biden's running mate on August 11, 2020. On August 13, *The New York Times* reported that Warren was one of Biden's four finalists along with Harris, Susan Rice, and Gretchen Whitmer.[143]\n\n\nIn late April, CNBC reported that big-money donors were pressuring Biden not to choose Warren, preferring other candidates purportedly on his list, such as Harris, Whitmer, and Amy Klobuchar.[144]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWarren and her first husband divorced in 1978,[15][19] and two years later, Warren married law professor Bruce H. Mann on July 12, 1980,[145] but kept her first husband's surname.[19][146] Warren has three grandchildren through her daughter Amelia.[147]\n\n\nOn April 23, 2020, Warren announced on Twitter that her eldest brother, Don Reed Herring, had died of COVID-19 two days earlier.[148][149] On October 1, 2021, she announced that her brother, John Herring, had died of cancer.[150]\n\n\nAs of 2019, according to Forbes Magazine, Warren's net worth was $12 million.[151][152]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Elizabeth Warren\n\n![](image)Warren with a supporter wearing a \"Warren has a plan for that\" T-shirt. The phrase became an internet meme during her presidential run.[153]\nWarren is widely regarded as a progressive. In 2012, the British magazine *New Statesman* named Warren among the \"top 20 U.S. progressives\".[154]\n\n\nWarren supports worker representation on corporations' board of directors, breaking up monopolies, stiffening sentences for white-collar crime, a Medicare for All plan to provide health insurance for all Americans, and a higher minimum wage.[155]\n\n\nWarren was highly critical of the Trump administration. She expressed concerns over what she says were Trump's conflicts of interest. The Presidential Conflicts of Interest Act, written by Warren, was first read in the Senate in January 2017.[156][157] Warren was highly critical of Trump's immigration policies. In 2018, she called for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).[158]\n\n\nWarren has criticized U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen in support of Yemen's government against the Houthis.[159][160] In January 2019, Warren criticized Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She agreed that U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Syria and Afghanistan but said such withdrawals should be part of a \"coordinated\" plan formed with U.S. allies.[161]\n\n\nIn April 2019, after reading the Mueller report, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump, saying, \"The Mueller report lays out facts showing that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election to help Donald Trump and Donald Trump welcomed that help. Once elected, Donald Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack.\"[162]\n\n\nAfter the June 24, 2022, ruling in which the Supreme Court overturned *Roe v. Wade*, Warren wrote a *New York Times* op-ed requesting that President Biden unblock \"critical resources and authority that states and the federal government can use to meet the surge in demand for reproductive health services\".[163]\n\n\nOn March 13, 2023, Warren presented a detailed analysis of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10, 2023, and provided possible solutions to avoid further bank failures, in *The New York Times*.[164]\n\n\n\n## Ancestry and Native American issues[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Warren and her brothers, older family members told them during their childhood that they had some Native American ancestry.[165][166] In 2012, she said that \"being Native American has been part of my story, I guess, since the day I was born\".[167] In 1984,[168][169] Warren contributed recipes to a Native American cookbook and identified herself as Cherokee.[170][171]\n\n\nDuring Warren's first Senate race in 2012, her opponent, Scott Brown, speculated that she had fabricated Native ancestry to gain advantage on the employment market and used Warren's ancestry in several attack ads.[172][173][174] Warren has denied that her alleged heritage gave her any advantages in her schooling or her career.[175] Several colleagues and employers (including Harvard) have said her reported ethnic status played no role in her hiring.[176][177] From 1995 to 2004, her employer, Harvard Law School, listed her as a Native American in its federal affirmative action forms; Warren later said she was unaware of this.[178]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported that in 1986, Warren identified her race as \"American Indian\" on a State Bar of Texas write-in form used for statistical information gathering, but added that there was \"no indication it was used for professional advancement\".[179] A 2018 *Boston Globe* investigation found that her reported ethnicity played no role in her rise in the academic legal profession, and concluded there was \"clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools\", and that \"Warren was viewed as a white woman by the hiring committees at every institution that employed her\".[180] In February 2019, Warren apologized for having identified as Native American.[171][181][182]\n\n\nThroughout his presidency, former president Donald Trump mocked Warren for her assertions of Native American ancestry,[183] and pejoratively called her \"Pocahontas\".[184] At a July 2018 Montana rally, he promised that if he debated Warren, he would pay $1 million to her favorite charity if she took a DNA test and \"it shows you're an Indian\".[185] In October 2018, Warren released an analysis of a DNA test by geneticist Carlos D. Bustamante that found her ancestry to be mostly European but \"strongly support[ed] the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor\", likely \"in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago\".[186] Other geneticists, while not disputing the test's validity, found the underlying science \"flawed\" due to the lack of Native Americans in the United States in the database.[187] Geneticists Krystal Tsosie and Matthew Anderson called the interpretation of the test \"problematic\", citing, among other reasons, \"Warren's motives, and the genetic variants informing the comparison\". They added: \"because Bustamante used Indigenous individuals from Central and South America as a reference group to compare Warren's DNA, we believe he should have stated only that Warren potentially had an 'Indigenous' ancestor 6-10 generations ago, not conclusively a 'Native American' one. The distinction might seem hypercritical to most, but to the sovereign tribal nations of the United States it's an important one.\"[188]\n\n\nAfter publicizing Bustamante's interpretation of the test, Warren asked Trump to donate the money to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. Trump responded: \"I didn't say that. I think you better read it again\".[185][189][190] The Cherokee Nation called the use of DNA testing to determine Native American heritage \"inappropriate and wrong\".[177][191] According to *Politico*, \"Warren's past claims of American Indian ancestry garnered fierce criticism from both sides of the aisle\", with \"tribal leaders calling out Warren for claiming a heritage she did not culturally belong to.\"[184]\n\n\nDuring a January 2019 public appearance in Sioux City, Iowa, Warren was asked by an attendee, \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald more fodder to be a bully?\" She responded in part, \"I am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference.\"[192] She later privately contacted leadership of the Cherokee Nation to apologize \"for furthering confusion over issues of tribal sovereignty and citizenship and for any harm her announcement caused\". Cherokee Nation executive director of communications Julie Hubbard said that Warren understands \"that being a Cherokee Nation tribal citizen is rooted in centuries of culture and laws not through DNA tests\".[193] Warren apologized again in August 2019 before a Native American Forum in Iowa.[194][195]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Warren received a standing ovation during a surprise visit to a Native American conference, where she was introduced by freshman Representative Deb Haaland (D-NM), one of the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress.[196][197] Haaland endorsed Warren for president in July 2019, calling her \"a great partner for Indian Country\".[198]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Warren at the 2009 *Time* 100 Gala\nIn 2009, *The Boston Globe* named Warren the Bostonian of the Year[23] and the Women's Bar Association of Massachusetts honored her with the Lelia J. Robinson Award.[199] *The National Law Journal* has repeatedly named Warren one of the Fifty Most Influential Women Attorneys in America,[200][201] and in 2010 named her one of the 40 most influential attorneys of the decade.[202] Also in 2009, Warren became the first professor in Harvard's history to win the law school's Sacks–Freund Teaching Award for a second time.[203] In 2011, she delivered the commencement address at Rutgers Law School, her alma mater, and received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and membership in the Order of the Coif.[204] In 2011, Warren was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.[205] In January 2012, *New Statesman* magazine named her one of the \"top 20 U.S. progressives\".[154] Warren was named one of *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World in 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2017.[206][207][208][209][210]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Women's History Month theme in the United States was \"Nevertheless, She Persisted: Honoring Women Who Fight All Forms of Discrimination Against Women\", referring to McConnell's remark about Warren.[211]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* Warren has appeared in the documentary films *Maxed Out* (2007), Michael Moore's *Capitalism: A Love Story* (2009), *Heist: Who Stole the American Dream?* (2011), and *Makers: Women Who Make America* (2013).[212][213][214]\n* In 2017, Kate McKinnon played Warren on *Saturday Night Live*. McKinnon continued her impression of Warren in 2019 and 2020, during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[215][216] On the March 7, 2020, episode, Warren appeared as herself in the cold open alongside McKinnon's impression of her, and together they opened the show.[217]\n* In 2019, Warren wrote the entry on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for that year's *Time* 100.[218]\n* Warren's popularity is the basis of a wide array of merchandise sold in her name, much of which incorporates Mitch McConnell's remark \"Nevertheless, she persisted\",[219] including an action figure of Warren.[220]\n* Musician Jonathan Mann has written songs about Warren, including \"She Persisted\".[221][222]\n\n\n## Political protégés[edit]\n\n\nWarren has mentored several people who have gone on to hold notable political office. U.S. Representative Katie Porter, a former law student of Warren's, is considered a protégée of Warren.[223] Porter co-chaired Warren's presidential campaign.[224] Another of Warren's political protégés is Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who was a law student of Warren's and worked on her 2012 Senate campaign before running for Boston City Council herself in 2013.[225][226][227] Suffolk County Sheriff Steven W. Tompkins got his start in politics working on Warren's 2012 Senate campaign.[228] During his law school career, former U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III considered Warren a mentor.[229] A number of Warren acolytes serve in the Biden administration, including Bharat Ramamurti (a former economic policy advisor to Warren).[230]\n\n\n\n## Books and other works[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Warren and her daughter, Amelia Tyagi, wrote *The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke*. In the book they state that at that time, a fully employed worker earned less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker had 30 years earlier. Although families spent less at that time on clothing, appliances, and other forms of consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care had increased dramatically. According to the authors, the result was that even families with two income earners were no longer able to save and incurred ever greater debt.[231]\n\n\nIn an article in *The New York Times*, Jeff Madrick said of the book:\n\n\n\n\n>  The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children ... their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today. More clearly than anyone else, I think, Ms. Warren and Ms. Tyagi have shown how little attention the nation and our government have paid to the way Americans really live.[232] \n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein published a study on bankruptcy and medical bills[233] that found that half of all families filing for bankruptcy did so in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance.[234] The study was widely cited in policy debates, but some have challenged its methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only 17% of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.[235]\n\n\nMetropolitan Books published Warren's book *A Fighting Chance* in April 2014.[236] According to a *Boston Globe* review, \"the book's title refers to a time she says is now gone, when even families of modest means who worked hard and played by the rules had at a fair shot at the American dream.\"[237]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Warren published her 11th book,[4] *This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America's Middle Class*, in which she explores the plight of the American middle class and argues that the federal government needs to do more to help working families with stronger social programs and increased investment in education.[238]\n\n\n\nPublications\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Selected articles* Warren, Elizabeth (1987). \"Bankruptcy Policy\". *The University of Chicago Law Review*. **54** (3): 775–814. doi:10.2307/1599826.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993, and in the United States House of Representatives from Washington's 1st congressional district from 1993 to 1995.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cantwell graduated from Miami University before moving to Seattle to work on Alan Cranston's 1984 presidential campaign. In 1986, she was elected to the state House of Representatives, where she served until her election to Congress in 1992. Cantwell served one term in Congress before losing her seat to Republican Rick White in the 1994 election. She then briefly worked in the private sector as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks.\n\n\nDespite having vowed to remain out of politics, Cantwell ran for the United States Senate in 2000. She defeated Republican incumbent Slade Gorton in one of the closest elections in the state's history. Cantwell was reelected in 2006, 2012, and 2018. Upon the February 2017 resignation of Jeff Sessions to become United States Attorney General, she became the most senior junior senator. She is the second female senator from Washington, after Patty Murray.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early political career[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was raised in a predominantly Irish American neighborhood on the south side of Indianapolis. Her father, Paul Cantwell,[2] served as county commissioner, city councilor, state legislator, and chief of staff for U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr.;[2] he was the Democratic nominee for Mayor of Indianapolis in 1979.[3] Her mother, Rose, was an administrative assistant. Her ancestry includes Irish and German.[2]\n\n\nCantwell attended Emmerich Manual High School, and was inducted into the Indianapolis Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2006.[4] After high school, Cantwell attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in public administration.[5]\n\n\nA year after graduating, Cantwell worked on Jerry Springer's unsuccessful 1982 Ohio gubernatorial campaign.[6] Cantwell moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1983, to campaign for U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) in his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination.[6][5] She then moved to the Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace, because it reminded her of Indianapolis,[7] and led a successful campaign in 1986 to build a new library there.[8] As of 2000, Cantwell lived in Edmonds, Washington with her mother.[9]\n\n\n\n## Washington House of Representatives (1987–1993)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Cantwell was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives at the age of 28.[10] She defeated George Dahlquist 54%–46%.[11] In 1988, she was reelected with 66% of the vote.[12] In 1990, she was reelected to a third term with 61% of the vote.[13]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAs a state representative, Cantwell helped write Washington's Growth Management Act of 1990, which required cities to develop comprehensive growth plans, and she negotiated its passage.[14][15] She also worked on legislation regulating nursing homes. Cantwell resigned on January 3, 1993, in preparation to be sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n[16]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (Chair)\n\t+ As chairwoman of the whole committee, Cantwell serves as an *ex officio* member on all the subcommittees.\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n* Committee on Finance\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n1992\nIn the November election, Cantwell defeated Republican State Senator Gary A. Nelson 55%–42%.[17] She became the first Democrat elected to the United States House of Representatives from Washington's first congressional district in 40 years.\n\n\n\n1994\nRepublican Rick White defeated Cantwell 52%–48% in the 1994 United States House of Representatives elections.[18] Before that year's \"Republican Revolution\", eight of the nine representatives from the Washington state delegation were from the Democratic Party. After the election, five Democratic representatives from Washington state lost their positions, despite running for re-election, including Cantwell, future governor Jay Inslee, and Speaker of the House Tom Foley.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was called a \"savvy, pro-business Democrat\". She supported President Clinton's 1993 budget, which raised taxes and passed without the votes of many Democrats.[19] During her only term, she helped persuade the Clinton administration to terminate its support of the Clipper chip. She wrote a letter to Vice President Al Gore and staunchly opposed it because Microsoft Inc. was in her district.[20][21] She voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[22]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Public Works\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Merchant Marine and Fisheries\n\n\n## Private sector employment (1995–1999)[edit]\n\n\nAfter her defeat, Cantwell vowed to leave politics. Political ally Rob Glaser offered her a job as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks.[23] Among her accomplishments was the live Internet streaming broadcast of a Mariners-Yankees baseball game in 1995, which marked the start of Internet broadcasts of Major League Baseball games.[24]\n\n\nIn 1998, the company was criticized by privacy groups, which alleged that the RealJukebox software program incorporated spyware to track unsuspecting users' listening patterns and download history. In response, RealNetworks amended its privacy policy to fully disclose its privacy practices regarding user listening patterns. Subsequently, RealNetworks submitted to independent outside audits of its privacy practices. Several lawsuits regarding alleged privacy violations were settled out of court. This incident has shaped her views on privacy and her opposition to the Bush administration's post-9/11 policies.[25]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2001–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2000[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nAt the urging of party activists and officials, Cantwell formed an exploratory committee in October 1999 to consider a run for U.S. Senate against Democrat Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn and incumbent Republican Senator Slade Gorton. She committed to the race on January 19, 2000.[26] Cantwell entered the campaign a year after Senn, who was endorsed by the Washington State Labor Council and NARAL, and used her personal wealth to fund television advertisements.[27][28] Early on, privacy became an issue; Senn cited her record protecting medical privacy as insurance commissioner, while Cantwell promoted internet privacy and cited her opposition to the Clipper chip.[29] Senn later used television advertisements to accuse Cantwell of avoiding debates, as she had agreed to two debates while Senn preferred more.[30] They participated in three debates, during which they attacked each other. Senn attacked RealNetworks and Cantwell's role in the company; Cantwell accused Senn of wanting to run against RealNetworks, and said that Senn was uninformed on internet issues.[31][32] Cantwell was endorsed by *The Seattle Times*, the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer*,[33] *The Spokesman-Review*, and *The News Tribune*.[*citation needed*] She easily won her party's nomination, defeating Senn by a 3–1 margin in the primary.[34] Although he won re-nomination, Gorton got fewer votes than Cantwell and Senn's combined total.[35]\n\n\nSocial security, prescription drugs, dams, gun control, and campaign finance reform were among the most important issues in Cantwell's race against Gorton, which drew national attention.[36] Cantwell also adopted the slogan \"Your voice for a change\", a veiled reference to Gorton's campaign theme in 1980, challenging incumbent Warren Magnuson's age.[37] She said Gorton supported \"19th-century solutions to 21st-century problems\".[38] Cantwell was endorsed by *The Seattle Times* and the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer*, the state's two biggest newspapers.[*citation needed*] Gorton was endorsed by the smaller *The News Tribune* and two of the largest Eastern Washington newspapers, *The Spokesman-Review* and *Tri-City Herald*.[39] At times, the campaign was accused of pettiness as national PACs and groups funded television attack advertisements.[40] After a Cantwell campaign worker deep-linked to a humorous photo on Gorton's website, he accused Cantwell's campaign of hacking, and Senn accused Cantwell of hypocrisy. \"Fiddling with people's websites and calling it good fun ... adds a very childish and unworthy character to the race\", Senn's campaign spokeswoman Barbara Stenson said.[41] Cantwell spent over $10 million of her own money on her campaign, pledging not to accept money from PACs. When RealNetworks stock declined at the end of 2000, she spent time raising funds for debt retirement, but kept her pledge not to accept PAC money.[42] In the waning weeks of the campaign, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Cantwell violated federal campaign finance law by securing $3.8 million in bank loans for her campaign and failing to properly disclose the loans until January 30, 2001.[43] The complaint alleged that she had received a $600,000 line of credit without sufficient collateral, and another $1,000,000, all at a preferential interest rate. After review, the Federal Election Commission sent a letter of admonishment, saying that the loans were \"made on a basis that assures repayment, and that each loan bore the usual and customary interest rate\".[44]\n\n\nThe election was among the closest in Washington history.[45] Cantwell held a tiny lead in the initial returns on election night, but the race remained too close to call.[46] Gorton overtook her the next day, amassing a lead of 12,500 votes by the second week of absentee ballot counting.[47][48] The election result was certified on November 22 with a lead of 1,953 votes for Cantwell out of 2.5 million cast, credited to support from the Puget Sound region.[49][50] The 0.08% margin triggered an automatic recount, which increased her lead to 2,229 votes, or 0.09%. It was the last Senate race to be called in the 2000 election, which resulted in a 50–50 tie ahead of a contentious presidential election recount.[51] Cantwell and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan became the third and fourth women to defeat incumbent senators, following Kay Bailey Hutchison's 1993 and Dianne Feinstein's 1992 special-election victories.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nThe close 2004 gubernatorial race between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi suggested to many that the 2006 contest might go either way.[52] Both Cantwell and her opponent Republican Mike McGavick dominated their primaries; initial speculation favored a Republican victory.[53] \"At one point\", wrote analyst Larry Sabato, \"all the talk in this race concerned Cantwell's cool relations with anti-war Democratic elements and McGavick's relatively united base. But Democrats appear to have closed ranks behind their junior senator.\"[54] Cantwell was reelected by a 17-point margin, even winning several traditionally Republican counties in Eastern Washington, including Spokane County.[55][56] \n\n![](image)Cantwell (seated in the middle of the couch) with other female Senators of the 110th Congress, which served from 2007 until 2009.\nDuring the 2006 campaign, Cantwell received heavy criticism for declining most of the invitations she received to debate McGavick in public fora. Media outlets across the state, including *The Olympian* and the *Yakima Herald-Republic*, rebuked her, claiming she was afraid to confront McGavick, calling it \"unacceptable\"[57] and \"simply not fair\". Cantwell agreed to two debates with McGavick in Seattle and Spokane, lasting 60 and 30 minutes, respectively. When she ran for Senate in 2000 against Gorton, Gorton also agreed to only two debates of a similar format. Similarly, when Washington's senior senator, Patty Murray, ran for reelection in 2004, she agreed to only two debates with George Nethercutt, although each debate lasted an hour.[58]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nCantwell was reelected to a third term, defeating Republican State Senator Michael Baumgartner.[59]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nCantwell was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican Susan Hutchison.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was a proponent of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill of 2002, and co-sponsored the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act of 2001.[60][61] In 2005, she wrote a letter in support of the Perkins Loan program,[62] and told the *Seattle Times* in July 2006 that she opposed Social Security privatization.[63] Cantwell co-sponsored the \"Pension Fairness and Full Disclosure Act of 2005\".[64]\n\n\nAlso in 2005, Cantwell voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which angered many who opposed free trade agreements. Others argued that due to the state's unique economy, any senator from Washington almost had to vote for free trade pacts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cantwell responding to a question at a press conference in 2019.\nCiting his potential views on abortion and the environment, Cantwell was one of 22 senators to vote not to confirm United States Supreme Court nominee John Roberts.[65] In January 2006, after publicly announcing her opposition to Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, Cantwell, 18 other Democrats and all 53 present Republicans, voted for the cloture motion.[66] The success of this motion ended an unlikely attempt to filibuster Alito's confirmation led by Senators John Kerry and Ted Kennedy.[67] Alito was confirmed the next day by a vote of 58–42, with most Democrats, including Cantwell, voting against confirmation.\n\n\nIn 2010, Cantwell voted to invoke cloture to begin debate on the Don't ask, don't tell policy in the military.\n\n\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Cantwell received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Washington.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Iraq War[edit]\n\n\nOn October 11, 2002, Cantwell voted in favor of the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq. Her October 10, 2002, press release, quotes her as stating on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \"Mr. President, my vote for this resolution does not mean that I am convinced of the Administration has answered all the questions. I believe the following issues must be addressed before the U.N. or the U.S. move forward with military action.\" Cantwell detailed six specific areas in which her questions and concerns had yet to be satisfactorily addressed at the time of her vote to authorize war: \"First: Continued Multilateral Approach ... Second: Successful Military Strategy ... Third: A Post-War Commitment Strategy ... Fourth: Fighting the Broader War on Terrorism ... Fifth: Maintaining Middle East Stability ... Sixth: Protecting Iraqi Civilians.\"\n\n\nIn 2006, Cantwell voted against the Kerry-Feingold Amendment to S. 2766, which would have set a timetable for withdrawal,[69] but for the Levin-Reed Amendment,[70] which would encourage beginning a phased withdrawal by the end of the year, with no timetable for completion.\n\n\n\n#### Israel[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Cantwell co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[71] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[72]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Cantwell, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611).[73] This controversial legislation included provisions to improve border security, increased fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, created a guest worker program (which included a near doubling of the number of H1-B visas),[74] and created a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.[75] The bill, with support from Republican Party leadership, passed 62–36. Debate would have also commenced on the DREAM Act, but was halted by a Republican filibuster.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\nCantwell supports health care reform in the United States, and was a co-sponsor of Senator Ron Wyden's Healthy Americans Act. In her role as a member of the Finance Committee, she had an influential role in crafting health care reform legislation. On September 29, 2009, when the Finance Committee considered health care reform legislation, Cantwell supported amendments to establish a public health care option that would compete with private insurers.[77]\n\n\nIn 2009, *The Stranger* ran an article on Cantwell's opposition to the inclusion of a public option in the health-care reform plan. They reported: \"Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative *Seattle Times* editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, according to a recent poll. So what's going on with Washington's junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn't she want Congress to include a public option — a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone, and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs — in its health-care-reform package?\"[78] Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the Senate as the reason for her opposition.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Environment and energy[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to her opposition to drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, Cantwell was one of the most vocal critics of the increase of oil and gasoline prices during 2008.[79] Advocating increased regulation of futures markets and windfall profits taxes on oil profits, she has drawn scathing criticism from the *Wall Street Journal*.[80] In December 2005, Cantwell scored what many perceived as one of the strongest victories of her first term when she blocked Alaska senator Ted Stevens's efforts to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Stevens attached the measure to a bill that provided money for defense spending and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. Cantwell rounded up the votes of 41 Democrats[a] and three Republicans, enough to block a final vote.[81] Stevens removed the ANWR drilling measure from the larger bill, promising to bring the matter up at a later date.\n\n\nIn 2004, Cantwell received the highest rating possible from the League of Conservation Voters for her environmental voting record.[82] As of 2020, she has a lifetime score of 93% on the League's National Environmental Scorecard.[83] She is known for supporting alternative energy research and for protecting Washington's forests from logging and the construction of paved roads and has earned endorsement from various prominent environmental advocacy groups[82] and other environmental groups.[84][85] She has opposed drilling in ANWR on multiple occasions, has voted to reduce oil usage by 40% by 2025, and has opposed legislation to relax or terminate CAFE standards.[86] *The Seattle Times* has called Cantwell's environmental record \"pristine\",[87] and the Wilderness Society has called her an \"environmental champion\".[88]\n\n\nIn 2009, Cantwell introduced the Carbon Limits and Energy for America's Renewal (CLEAR) Act (S. 2877), also called the Cantwell-Collins bill, a \"cap and dividend\" emissions trading proposal.[89][90][91][92] Senator Susan Collins co-sponsored it.[93] The bill died in the Senate Finance Committee without debate or votes.[91][93]\n\n\nCantwell chaired the Senate Democrats 20/20 Energy Independence campaign and co-chaired the Apollo Alliance in 2006.[94] One of her main accomplishments was the passage of an amendment \"To prevent energy market manipulation\", which passed 57–40 in the Senate in November 2006; a previous effort was defeated by a vote of 50–48.[95]\n\n\nIn 2011, The Humane Society of the United States praised Cantwell's no-tolerance policy and effective removal of the practice of shark finning, which kills an estimated 73 million sharks per year.[96]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports that the EPA intended to decide against setting limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in drinking water as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Cantwell was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"[97]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Cantwell was one of eight senators to sign a bipartisan letter to congressional leadership, requesting full and lasting funding of the Land and Water Conservation Act, in order to aid national parks and public lands, benefit the $887 billion American outdoor recreation economy, and \"ensure much-needed investment in our public lands and continuity for the state, tribal, and non-federal partners who depend on them\".[98]\n\n\n\n#### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Cantwell was among the 42 Democrats to vote unsuccessfully to include a $15 hourly minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and contraceptives[edit]\n\n\nCantwell has expressed support for making Plan B contraceptives available to girls 16 and under. In 2007, she co-sponsored the Prevention First Act, a bill that sought to increase national access to family planning and preventative methods as a means to reduce unwanted pregnancies.[100] It included providing women with access to Plan B, as well as expanding family planning to be covered under Medicaid.[100] As an advocate of increasing access to family planning and sexual health education, Cantwell argues that these venues for increased education are necessary to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.[101] She received criticism from her Republican challenger, State Senator Michael Baumgartner, who suggested that she was too extreme and too far to the left of Washington voters on this issue, and expressed concern about 11-year-olds getting these drugs without a prescription.[102]\n\n\nCantwell calls herself \"100% pro-choice\", and consistently supports the pro-choice movement's positions. She was one of 34 senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which President George W. Bush signed into law in November 2003. She also voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which made it an additional crime to kill or harm a fetus during a criminal assault upon the mother. That bill passed the Senate by a vote of 61–38, and was signed into law by Bush on in 2004.\n\n\n\n#### Sexual abuse in Olympic sports[edit]\n\n\nCantwell chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), the United States Center for SafeSport (SafeSport), and the issue of sexual abuse in Olympic sports.[103][104] She has praised the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, crafted to protect athletes from emotional and physical abuse and harassment, which created SafeSport to prevent and respond to misconduct.[105]\n\n\n\n#### Support for fellow Democrats[edit]\n\n\nCantwell is a major supporter of fellow Democratic candidates for public office. In 2006, facing her own challenging race, she used ActBlue to raise $100,000 for Darcy Burner, Peter J. Goldmark, and Richard Wright, all of whom were facing difficult House races in Washington. In the 2008 cycle, Cantwell was particularly committed to supporting Senator Mary Landrieu's reelection.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cantwell speaks during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.\nOn December 31, 2007, Cantwell became the 10th senator to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.[106] She supported Clinton throughout the primaries,[107] but vowed to vote for the winner of the pledged delegates.[108] After Clinton conceded on June 7, Cantwell endorsed Obama.[109] At the Washington State Democratic Convention on June 15, she said: \"I do want to see a strong Democratic woman in the White House ... That's why I'm so glad Michelle Obama will be the next first lady.\"[110]\n\n\nOn October 20, 2013, Cantwell was one of 16 female Democratic senators to sign a letter endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 Presidential Election.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Criticism of Amanda Knox's wrongful conviction[edit]\n\n\nOn December 4, 2009, the day that 22-year-old Washingtonian Amanda Knox was wrongly convicted by an Italian court of the murder of Meredith Kercher, Cantwell released a statement expressing her dismay at the verdict, saying that she had \"serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted [the] trial.\" She stated that the evidence against Knox was insufficient, that Knox had been subjected to \"harsh treatment\" following her arrest, and that there had been \"negligence\" in the handling of evidence. She also complained that jurors had not been sequestered, allowing them to view \"negative news coverage\" about Knox, and that one of the prosecutors had a misconduct case pending in relation to another trial.[112] Cantwell said she would seek assistance from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A State Department spokesman said in December 2009 that the department had followed the case closely and would continue to do so.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served in the Washington House of Representatives from 1987 to 1993, and in the United States House of Representatives from Washington's 1st congressional district from 1993 to 1995.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cantwell graduated from Miami University before moving to Seattle to work on Alan Cranston's 1984 presidential campaign. In 1986, she was elected to the state House of Representatives, where she served until her election to Congress in 1992. Cantwell served one term in Congress before losing her seat to Republican Rick White in the 1994 election. She then briefly worked in the private sector as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks.\n\n\nDespite having vowed to remain out of politics, Cantwell ran for the United States Senate in 2000. She defeated Republican incumbent Slade Gorton in one of the closest elections in the state's history. Cantwell was reelected in 2006, 2012, and 2018. Upon the February 2017 resignation of Jeff Sessions to become United States Attorney General, she became the most senior junior senator. She is the second female senator from Washington, after Patty Murray.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and early political career[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. She was raised in a predominantly Irish American neighborhood on the south side of Indianapolis. Her father, Paul Cantwell,[2] served as county commissioner, city councilor, state legislator, and chief of staff for U.S. Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr.;[2] he was the Democratic nominee for Mayor of Indianapolis in 1979.[3] Her mother, Rose, was an administrative assistant. Her ancestry includes Irish and German.[2]\n\n\nCantwell attended Emmerich Manual High School, and was inducted into the Indianapolis Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2006.[4] After high school, Cantwell attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in public administration.[5]\n\n\nA year after graduating, Cantwell worked on Jerry Springer's unsuccessful 1982 Ohio gubernatorial campaign.[6] Cantwell moved to Seattle, Washington, in 1983, to campaign for U.S. Senator Alan Cranston (D-CA) in his unsuccessful bid for the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination.[6][5] She then moved to the Seattle suburb of Mountlake Terrace, because it reminded her of Indianapolis,[7] and led a successful campaign in 1986 to build a new library there.[8] As of 2000, Cantwell lived in Edmonds, Washington with her mother.[9]\n\n\n\n## Washington House of Representatives (1987–1993)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, Cantwell was elected to the Washington State House of Representatives at the age of 28.[10] She defeated George Dahlquist 54%–46%.[11] In 1988, she was reelected with 66% of the vote.[12] In 1990, she was reelected to a third term with 61% of the vote.[13]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAs a state representative, Cantwell helped write Washington's Growth Management Act of 1990, which required cities to develop comprehensive growth plans, and she negotiated its passage.[14][15] She also worked on legislation regulating nursing homes. Cantwell resigned on January 3, 1993, in preparation to be sworn in as a member of the United States House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n[16]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation (Chair)\n\t+ As chairwoman of the whole committee, Cantwell serves as an *ex officio* member on all the subcommittees.\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n* Committee on Finance\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n1992\nIn the November election, Cantwell defeated Republican State Senator Gary A. Nelson 55%–42%.[17] She became the first Democrat elected to the United States House of Representatives from Washington's first congressional district in 40 years.\n\n\n\n1994\nRepublican Rick White defeated Cantwell 52%–48% in the 1994 United States House of Representatives elections.[18] Before that year's \"Republican Revolution\", eight of the nine representatives from the Washington state delegation were from the Democratic Party. After the election, five Democratic representatives from Washington state lost their positions, despite running for re-election, including Cantwell, future governor Jay Inslee, and Speaker of the House Tom Foley.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was called a \"savvy, pro-business Democrat\". She supported President Clinton's 1993 budget, which raised taxes and passed without the votes of many Democrats.[19] During her only term, she helped persuade the Clinton administration to terminate its support of the Clipper chip. She wrote a letter to Vice President Al Gore and staunchly opposed it because Microsoft Inc. was in her district.[20][21] She voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).[22]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Public Works\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Merchant Marine and Fisheries\n\n\n## Private sector employment (1995–1999)[edit]\n\n\nAfter her defeat, Cantwell vowed to leave politics. Political ally Rob Glaser offered her a job as vice president of marketing for RealNetworks.[23] Among her accomplishments was the live Internet streaming broadcast of a Mariners-Yankees baseball game in 1995, which marked the start of Internet broadcasts of Major League Baseball games.[24]\n\n\nIn 1998, the company was criticized by privacy groups, which alleged that the RealJukebox software program incorporated spyware to track unsuspecting users' listening patterns and download history. In response, RealNetworks amended its privacy policy to fully disclose its privacy practices regarding user listening patterns. Subsequently, RealNetworks submitted to independent outside audits of its privacy practices. Several lawsuits regarding alleged privacy violations were settled out of court. This incident has shaped her views on privacy and her opposition to the Bush administration's post-9/11 policies.[25]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (2001–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2000[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nAt the urging of party activists and officials, Cantwell formed an exploratory committee in October 1999 to consider a run for U.S. Senate against Democrat Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn and incumbent Republican Senator Slade Gorton. She committed to the race on January 19, 2000.[26] Cantwell entered the campaign a year after Senn, who was endorsed by the Washington State Labor Council and NARAL, and used her personal wealth to fund television advertisements.[27][28] Early on, privacy became an issue; Senn cited her record protecting medical privacy as insurance commissioner, while Cantwell promoted internet privacy and cited her opposition to the Clipper chip.[29] Senn later used television advertisements to accuse Cantwell of avoiding debates, as she had agreed to two debates while Senn preferred more.[30] They participated in three debates, during which they attacked each other. Senn attacked RealNetworks and Cantwell's role in the company; Cantwell accused Senn of wanting to run against RealNetworks, and said that Senn was uninformed on internet issues.[31][32] Cantwell was endorsed by *The Seattle Times*, the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer*,[33] *The Spokesman-Review*, and *The News Tribune*.[*citation needed*] She easily won her party's nomination, defeating Senn by a 3–1 margin in the primary.[34] Although he won re-nomination, Gorton got fewer votes than Cantwell and Senn's combined total.[35]\n\n\nSocial security, prescription drugs, dams, gun control, and campaign finance reform were among the most important issues in Cantwell's race against Gorton, which drew national attention.[36] Cantwell also adopted the slogan \"Your voice for a change\", a veiled reference to Gorton's campaign theme in 1980, challenging incumbent Warren Magnuson's age.[37] She said Gorton supported \"19th-century solutions to 21st-century problems\".[38] Cantwell was endorsed by *The Seattle Times* and the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer*, the state's two biggest newspapers.[*citation needed*] Gorton was endorsed by the smaller *The News Tribune* and two of the largest Eastern Washington newspapers, *The Spokesman-Review* and *Tri-City Herald*.[39] At times, the campaign was accused of pettiness as national PACs and groups funded television attack advertisements.[40] After a Cantwell campaign worker deep-linked to a humorous photo on Gorton's website, he accused Cantwell's campaign of hacking, and Senn accused Cantwell of hypocrisy. \"Fiddling with people's websites and calling it good fun ... adds a very childish and unworthy character to the race\", Senn's campaign spokeswoman Barbara Stenson said.[41] Cantwell spent over $10 million of her own money on her campaign, pledging not to accept money from PACs. When RealNetworks stock declined at the end of 2000, she spent time raising funds for debt retirement, but kept her pledge not to accept PAC money.[42] In the waning weeks of the campaign, the Federal Election Commission ruled that Cantwell violated federal campaign finance law by securing $3.8 million in bank loans for her campaign and failing to properly disclose the loans until January 30, 2001.[43] The complaint alleged that she had received a $600,000 line of credit without sufficient collateral, and another $1,000,000, all at a preferential interest rate. After review, the Federal Election Commission sent a letter of admonishment, saying that the loans were \"made on a basis that assures repayment, and that each loan bore the usual and customary interest rate\".[44]\n\n\nThe election was among the closest in Washington history.[45] Cantwell held a tiny lead in the initial returns on election night, but the race remained too close to call.[46] Gorton overtook her the next day, amassing a lead of 12,500 votes by the second week of absentee ballot counting.[47][48] The election result was certified on November 22 with a lead of 1,953 votes for Cantwell out of 2.5 million cast, credited to support from the Puget Sound region.[49][50] The 0.08% margin triggered an automatic recount, which increased her lead to 2,229 votes, or 0.09%. It was the last Senate race to be called in the 2000 election, which resulted in a 50–50 tie ahead of a contentious presidential election recount.[51] Cantwell and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan became the third and fourth women to defeat incumbent senators, following Kay Bailey Hutchison's 1993 and Dianne Feinstein's 1992 special-election victories.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nThe close 2004 gubernatorial race between Democrat Christine Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi suggested to many that the 2006 contest might go either way.[52] Both Cantwell and her opponent Republican Mike McGavick dominated their primaries; initial speculation favored a Republican victory.[53] \"At one point\", wrote analyst Larry Sabato, \"all the talk in this race concerned Cantwell's cool relations with anti-war Democratic elements and McGavick's relatively united base. But Democrats appear to have closed ranks behind their junior senator.\"[54] Cantwell was reelected by a 17-point margin, even winning several traditionally Republican counties in Eastern Washington, including Spokane County.[55][56] \n\n![](image)Cantwell (seated in the middle of the couch) with other female Senators of the 110th Congress, which served from 2007 until 2009.\nDuring the 2006 campaign, Cantwell received heavy criticism for declining most of the invitations she received to debate McGavick in public fora. Media outlets across the state, including *The Olympian* and the *Yakima Herald-Republic*, rebuked her, claiming she was afraid to confront McGavick, calling it \"unacceptable\"[57] and \"simply not fair\". Cantwell agreed to two debates with McGavick in Seattle and Spokane, lasting 60 and 30 minutes, respectively. When she ran for Senate in 2000 against Gorton, Gorton also agreed to only two debates of a similar format. Similarly, when Washington's senior senator, Patty Murray, ran for reelection in 2004, she agreed to only two debates with George Nethercutt, although each debate lasted an hour.[58]\n\n\n\n#### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nCantwell was reelected to a third term, defeating Republican State Senator Michael Baumgartner.[59]\n\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nCantwell was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Republican Susan Hutchison.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nCantwell was a proponent of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill of 2002, and co-sponsored the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act of 2001.[60][61] In 2005, she wrote a letter in support of the Perkins Loan program,[62] and told the *Seattle Times* in July 2006 that she opposed Social Security privatization.[63] Cantwell co-sponsored the \"Pension Fairness and Full Disclosure Act of 2005\".[64]\n\n\nAlso in 2005, Cantwell voted for the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), which angered many who opposed free trade agreements. Others argued that due to the state's unique economy, any senator from Washington almost had to vote for free trade pacts.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cantwell responding to a question at a press conference in 2019.\nCiting his potential views on abortion and the environment, Cantwell was one of 22 senators to vote not to confirm United States Supreme Court nominee John Roberts.[65] In January 2006, after publicly announcing her opposition to Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, Cantwell, 18 other Democrats and all 53 present Republicans, voted for the cloture motion.[66] The success of this motion ended an unlikely attempt to filibuster Alito's confirmation led by Senators John Kerry and Ted Kennedy.[67] Alito was confirmed the next day by a vote of 58–42, with most Democrats, including Cantwell, voting against confirmation.\n\n\nIn 2010, Cantwell voted to invoke cloture to begin debate on the Don't ask, don't tell policy in the military.\n\n\nIn the 2016 United States presidential election, Cantwell received one electoral vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Washington.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Iraq War[edit]\n\n\nOn October 11, 2002, Cantwell voted in favor of the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq. Her October 10, 2002, press release, quotes her as stating on the floor of the U.S. Senate, \"Mr. President, my vote for this resolution does not mean that I am convinced of the Administration has answered all the questions. I believe the following issues must be addressed before the U.N. or the U.S. move forward with military action.\" Cantwell detailed six specific areas in which her questions and concerns had yet to be satisfactorily addressed at the time of her vote to authorize war: \"First: Continued Multilateral Approach ... Second: Successful Military Strategy ... Third: A Post-War Commitment Strategy ... Fourth: Fighting the Broader War on Terrorism ... Fifth: Maintaining Middle East Stability ... Sixth: Protecting Iraqi Civilians.\"\n\n\nIn 2006, Cantwell voted against the Kerry-Feingold Amendment to S. 2766, which would have set a timetable for withdrawal,[69] but for the Levin-Reed Amendment,[70] which would encourage beginning a phased withdrawal by the end of the year, with no timetable for completion.\n\n\n\n#### Israel[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2017, Cantwell co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S.270), which made it a federal crime, punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment,[71] for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories if protesting actions by the Israeli government.[72]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Cantwell, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611).[73] This controversial legislation included provisions to improve border security, increased fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, created a guest worker program (which included a near doubling of the number of H1-B visas),[74] and created a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.[75] The bill, with support from Republican Party leadership, passed 62–36. Debate would have also commenced on the DREAM Act, but was halted by a Republican filibuster.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\nCantwell supports health care reform in the United States, and was a co-sponsor of Senator Ron Wyden's Healthy Americans Act. In her role as a member of the Finance Committee, she had an influential role in crafting health care reform legislation. On September 29, 2009, when the Finance Committee considered health care reform legislation, Cantwell supported amendments to establish a public health care option that would compete with private insurers.[77]\n\n\nIn 2009, *The Stranger* ran an article on Cantwell's opposition to the inclusion of a public option in the health-care reform plan. They reported: \"Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative *Seattle Times* editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, according to a recent poll. So what's going on with Washington's junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn't she want Congress to include a public option — a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone, and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs — in its health-care-reform package?\"[78] Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the Senate as the reason for her opposition.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Environment and energy[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to her opposition to drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge, Cantwell was one of the most vocal critics of the increase of oil and gasoline prices during 2008.[79] Advocating increased regulation of futures markets and windfall profits taxes on oil profits, she has drawn scathing criticism from the *Wall Street Journal*.[80] In December 2005, Cantwell scored what many perceived as one of the strongest victories of her first term when she blocked Alaska senator Ted Stevens's efforts to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Stevens attached the measure to a bill that provided money for defense spending and Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts. Cantwell rounded up the votes of 41 Democrats[a] and three Republicans, enough to block a final vote.[81] Stevens removed the ANWR drilling measure from the larger bill, promising to bring the matter up at a later date.\n\n\nIn 2004, Cantwell received the highest rating possible from the League of Conservation Voters for her environmental voting record.[82] As of 2020, she has a lifetime score of 93% on the League's National Environmental Scorecard.[83] She is known for supporting alternative energy research and for protecting Washington's forests from logging and the construction of paved roads and has earned endorsement from various prominent environmental advocacy groups[82] and other environmental groups.[84][85] She has opposed drilling in ANWR on multiple occasions, has voted to reduce oil usage by 40% by 2025, and has opposed legislation to relax or terminate CAFE standards.[86] *The Seattle Times* has called Cantwell's environmental record \"pristine\",[87] and the Wilderness Society has called her an \"environmental champion\".[88]\n\n\nIn 2009, Cantwell introduced the Carbon Limits and Energy for America's Renewal (CLEAR) Act (S. 2877), also called the Cantwell-Collins bill, a \"cap and dividend\" emissions trading proposal.[89][90][91][92] Senator Susan Collins co-sponsored it.[93] The bill died in the Senate Finance Committee without debate or votes.[91][93]\n\n\nCantwell chaired the Senate Democrats 20/20 Energy Independence campaign and co-chaired the Apollo Alliance in 2006.[94] One of her main accomplishments was the passage of an amendment \"To prevent energy market manipulation\", which passed 57–40 in the Senate in November 2006; a previous effort was defeated by a vote of 50–48.[95]\n\n\nIn 2011, The Humane Society of the United States praised Cantwell's no-tolerance policy and effective removal of the practice of shark finning, which kills an estimated 73 million sharks per year.[96]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports that the EPA intended to decide against setting limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in drinking water as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Cantwell was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\"[97]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Cantwell was one of eight senators to sign a bipartisan letter to congressional leadership, requesting full and lasting funding of the Land and Water Conservation Act, in order to aid national parks and public lands, benefit the $887 billion American outdoor recreation economy, and \"ensure much-needed investment in our public lands and continuity for the state, tribal, and non-federal partners who depend on them\".[98]\n\n\n\n#### Minimum wage[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Cantwell was among the 42 Democrats to vote unsuccessfully to include a $15 hourly minimum wage in the American Rescue Plan.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and contraceptives[edit]\n\n\nCantwell has expressed support for making Plan B contraceptives available to girls 16 and under. In 2007, she co-sponsored the Prevention First Act, a bill that sought to increase national access to family planning and preventative methods as a means to reduce unwanted pregnancies.[100] It included providing women with access to Plan B, as well as expanding family planning to be covered under Medicaid.[100] As an advocate of increasing access to family planning and sexual health education, Cantwell argues that these venues for increased education are necessary to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.[101] She received criticism from her Republican challenger, State Senator Michael Baumgartner, who suggested that she was too extreme and too far to the left of Washington voters on this issue, and expressed concern about 11-year-olds getting these drugs without a prescription.[102]\n\n\nCantwell calls herself \"100% pro-choice\", and consistently supports the pro-choice movement's positions. She was one of 34 senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which President George W. Bush signed into law in November 2003. She also voted against the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, which made it an additional crime to kill or harm a fetus during a criminal assault upon the mother. That bill passed the Senate by a vote of 61–38, and was signed into law by Bush on in 2004.\n\n\n\n#### Sexual abuse in Olympic sports[edit]\n\n\nCantwell chairs the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, which has jurisdiction over the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), the United States Center for SafeSport (SafeSport), and the issue of sexual abuse in Olympic sports.[103][104] She has praised the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, crafted to protect athletes from emotional and physical abuse and harassment, which created SafeSport to prevent and respond to misconduct.[105]\n\n\n\n#### Support for fellow Democrats[edit]\n\n\nCantwell is a major supporter of fellow Democratic candidates for public office. In 2006, facing her own challenging race, she used ActBlue to raise $100,000 for Darcy Burner, Peter J. Goldmark, and Richard Wright, all of whom were facing difficult House races in Washington. In the 2008 cycle, Cantwell was particularly committed to supporting Senator Mary Landrieu's reelection.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cantwell speaks during the second day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.\nOn December 31, 2007, Cantwell became the 10th senator to endorse Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.[106] She supported Clinton throughout the primaries,[107] but vowed to vote for the winner of the pledged delegates.[108] After Clinton conceded on June 7, Cantwell endorsed Obama.[109] At the Washington State Democratic Convention on June 15, she said: \"I do want to see a strong Democratic woman in the White House ... That's why I'm so glad Michelle Obama will be the next first lady.\"[110]\n\n\nOn October 20, 2013, Cantwell was one of 16 female Democratic senators to sign a letter endorsing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in the 2016 Presidential Election.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Criticism of Amanda Knox's wrongful conviction[edit]\n\n\nOn December 4, 2009, the day that 22-year-old Washingtonian Amanda Knox was wrongly convicted by an Italian court of the murder of Meredith Kercher, Cantwell released a statement expressing her dismay at the verdict, saying that she had \"serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted [the] trial.\" She stated that the evidence against Knox was insufficient, that Knox had been subjected to \"harsh treatment\" following her arrest, and that there had been \"negligence\" in the handling of evidence. She also complained that jurors had not been sequestered, allowing them to view \"negative news coverage\" about Knox, and that one of the prosecutors had a misconduct case pending in relation to another trial.[112] Cantwell said she would seek assistance from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A State Department spokesman said in December 2009 that the department had followed the case closely and would continue to do so. He added: \"It is still in the early days but ... we haven't received any indications necessarily that Italian law was not followed.\"[113] Knox was later exonerated.[114]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\nCantwell's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[115]\n\n\n\n* **Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation (Chair)**\n\t+ As Chair, Cantwell is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees.\n* Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n* Committee on Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure\n\t+ Subcommittee on Health Care\n\t+ Subcommittee on Taxation and IRS Oversight\n* Committee on Indian Affairs\n* Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship\n* Joint Committee on Taxation\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues[116][*failed verification*]\n* Congressional Hazards Caucus[117]\n* Congressional Internet Caucus[*citation needed*]\n* Congressional Wine Caucus[*citation needed*]\n* Senate National Guard Caucus[*citation needed*]\n* Senate New Democrat Coalition[118]\n* Senate Steel Caucus[*citation needed*]\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2000 Washington US Senate general election results[119]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Maria Cantwell**  | **1,199,437**  | **48.73%**  | **+4.48%**  |\n|  | Republican | Slade Gorton (incumbent)\n | 1,197,208\n | 48.64%\n | -7.11%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | Jeff Jared\n | 64,734\n | 2.63%\n | +2.6%\n |\n| **Plurality** | 2,229\n | 0.09%\n |  |\n| Turnout | 2,461,379\n | 100%\n | +761,206\n |\n|  | Democratic **gain** from Republican |\n\n\n\n\n2006 Washington US Senate Democratic primary results\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Maria Cantwell (Incumbent)**  | **570,677**  | **90.76%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Hong Tran | 33,124\n | 5.27%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Mike The Mover | 11,274\n | 1.79%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Michael Goodspaceguy Nelson | 9,454\n | 1.50%\n |\n|  | Democratic | Mohammad H.

A Sound Politics reporter had the file unsealed and discovered that Cantwell was identified in the divorce records \"as the 'other woman'\".[124]\n\n\nCantwell was also formerly in a relationship with Seattle-based track and cross country star Scott Daggatt, then serving as a stockbroker of a Seattle-based National Securities Corporation.[125]\n\n\nOwing to a sharp decrease in the value of her RealNetworks stock, Cantwell's personal fortune had declined significantly by 2011.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Including one Independent who caucused with the Democrats.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Home | U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington\". *www.cantwell.senate.gov*.

A member of the Democratic Party, Murray served in the Washington State Senate from 1989 to 1993. She was Washington's first female U.S. senator and is the first woman in American history to hold the position of president pro tempore. Murray is also the youngest senator to occupy the office of president pro tempore in more than five decades.[1] As president pro tempore, Murray is third in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency.[a]\n\n\nBorn and raised in Bothell, Washington, Murray graduated from Washington State University with a degree in physical education. She worked as a pre-school teacher and, later, as a parenting teacher at Shoreline Community College. A long-time advocate for environmental and education issues, Murray was elected to serve on her local school board in King County. She ran for the Washington State Senate in 1988, and defeated two-term incumbent Bill Kiskaddon. She served one term before launching a campaign for the United States Senate in 1992. She has been re-elected five times, most recently in 2022.\n\n\nAs a senator, Murray has been a part of party leadership since 2001, having served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Conference secretary, and assistant Democratic leader. She currently chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Before assuming her current roles, Murray has previously chaired at various times, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Murray garnered national attention in 2013, when she and Republican representative Paul Ryan announced that they had negotiated a two-year, bipartisan budget, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Murray is currently the third-most senior senator,[2] the most senior Senate Democrat, the second-longest serving woman to ever serve in the Senate, and the dean of Washington's congressional delegation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nOne of seven children, Murray was born in Bothell, Washington, a daughter of David L. Johns and Beverly A. McLaughlin.[3] Her mother was an accountant. Her father served in World War II and was awarded a Purple Heart. Her ancestry includes Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and French-Canadian.[3] When she was a teenager, her family was forced to apply for welfare assistance when her father became disabled due to multiple sclerosis. He had been the manager of a five-and-ten store.[4] Murray attended Saint Brendan Catholic School as a young child.\n\n\nMurray received a Bachelor of Arts degree in physical education from Washington State University in 1972.\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nMurray was a preschool teacher for several years, and taught a parenting class at Shoreline Community College from 1984 to 1987.[5] As a citizen-lobbyist for environmental and educational issues, Murray has said that a state representative once told her she could not make a difference because she was just a \"mom in tennis shoes\".[6] The phrase stuck, and she later used it in her successful campaigns for the Shoreline School District board of directors (1985–89), Washington State Senate (1989–93), and United States Senate (1993–present).[6] Murray was successful in gathering grassroots support to strike down proposed preschool program budget cuts.[7][8]\n\n\nIn 1988, Murray unseated two-term incumbent Republican state Senator Bill Kiskaddon.[9]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1993–present)[edit]\n\n\nMurray has served in the United States Senate since her election in 1992. For the 118th Congress in 2023, she was elected Senate president pro tempore; the office is usually held by the senior senator of the majority party, but Senator Dianne Feinstein (who was also elected in 1992, but took her seat a few months prior to Murray because she won a special election, rather than a regularly scheduled one) declined the post due to ailing health, leaving Murray the next in line for the position. Murray would ultimately become the most senior serving Democrat upon Feinstein's death in 2023. Murray is the first woman to hold the position.[10] As president pro tempore of the Senate, she is currently third in the United States presidential line of succession. Murray is also the current chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nMurray is the first woman, and 33rd senator overall, to have cast 10,000 votes in the Senate, having reached the threshold on April 20, 2023.[11]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1992[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1992 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nIn 1992, Murray announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate after *The Seattle Times* published a series of articles alleging that incumbent Democratic Senator Brock Adams had sexually assaulted a number of women.[12][13] Adams denied the allegations, but his popularity weakened considerably and he chose to retire rather than risk losing the seat for his party. Murray defeated Congressman Don Bonker for the Democratic nomination. In the general election she defeated Republican Congressman Rod Chandler, 54% to 46%, despite being outspent by a wide margin. Chandler seemed to have the upper hand in one of the debates until he responded to Murray's criticism for spending $120,000 on congressional mailings during rising unemployment and declining family income as part of an economic recession by quoting the Roger Miller song \"Dang Me\".[14] Chandler was further damaged by the unpopularity in the Pacific Northwest of President George H. W. Bush, who was largely blamed for the recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n1992 U.S. Senate primary in Washington[15]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Patty Murray**  | **318,455**  | **28.32%**  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Rod Chandler**  | **228,083**  | **20.28%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Don Bonker | 208,321\n | 18.52%\n |\n|  | Republican | Leo K.

Term limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt's broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unexpectedly unseated Speaker Tom Foley in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the Cascades since Miles Poindexter in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the war in Iraq. Nethercutt supported the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start and his campaign never gained much traction. Murray was reelected, 55% to 43%.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Democratic primary election results\n |\n| --- |\n| **Party** | **Candidate** | **Votes** | **%** |\n| Democratic\n | **Patty Murray** (incumbent)\n | **709,477** | **92.20** |\n| Democratic\n | Warren Hanson\n | 46,487\n | 6.04\n |\n| Democratic\n | Mohammad Said\n | 13,526\n | 1.76\n |\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election results[20]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Patty Murray (incumbent)**  | **1,549,708**  | **54.98**  |\n|  | Republican | George R.

In the August 17 primary, Murray appeared on the ballot alongside four other Democratic candidates, six Republican candidates, a Reform Party candidate and three independent candidates. She received a plurality, 46%, and advanced to the general election along with her main Republican challenger, former state Senator and two-time gubernatorial nominee Dino Rossi, who received 33%.[21][22] Leading up to the election, several prominent Washington State newspapers endorsed Murray.[23][24][25][26] Rossi conceded the election to Murray on November 4, 2010, two days after election day. She won 52.08% of the vote to Rossi's 47.37%, Murray's smallest reelection margin to date.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlanket primary election results[27][28]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Patty Murray (incumbent)**  | **670,284**  | **46.22**  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Dino Rossi**  | **483,305**  | **33.33**  |\n|  | Republican | Clint Didier | 185,034\n | 12.76\n |\n|  | Republican | Paul Akers\n | 37,231\n | 2.57\n |\n|  | Independent | Skip Mercer\n | 12,122\n | 0.84\n |\n|  | Democratic | Charles Allen\n | 11,525\n | 0.79\n |\n|  | Democratic | Bob Burr\n | 11,344\n | 0.78\n |\n|  | Republican | Norma Gruber\n | 9,162\n | 0.63\n |\n|  | Republican | Michael Latimer\n | 6,545\n | 0.45\n |\n|  | Democratic | Mike the Mover\n | 6,019\n | 0.42\n |\n|  | Democratic | Goodspaceguy\n | 4,718\n | 0.33\n |\n|  | Reform | William Baker\n | 4,593\n | 0.32\n |\n|  | Independent | Mohammad Said\n | 3,387\n | 0.23\n |\n|  | Independent | Schalk Leonard\n | 2,818\n | 0.19\n |\n|  | Republican | William Chovil\n | 2,039\n | 0.14\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,450,126**  | **100**  |\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election results[29]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Patty Murray (incumbent)**  | **1,314,930**  | **52.08**  |\n|  | Republican | Dino Rossi | 1,196,164\n | 47.37\n |\n|  | Write-in | 13,939\n | 0.55\n |\n| Total votes\n | **2,525,033**  | **100.00%**  |\n|  | Democratic **hold** |\n\n\n#### 2016[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2016 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nMurray ran for a fifth term in 2016.

Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), launching an interactive website regarding the nomination of Judge John Roberts as the Chief Justice of the United States.\nMurray's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[35]\n\n\n\n* **Committee on Appropriations (chair)**\n\t+ As chair, Murray is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees. Nevertheless, she also chairs the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies in an individual capacity.\n* Committee on the Budget\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Senate Oceans Caucus\n* Senate Aerospace Caucus\n* Afterschool Caucuses[36]\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[37]\n\n\n### Legislation[edit]\n\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Murray introduced the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act into the Senate. The bill would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in the state of Washington unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors.[38] Murray argued that the bill should be passed in order to help the tourism industry in the area while protecting the lookout point in question.[39] The bill would be \"a very small step in what will be a very long recovery\" and would \"provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term recovery of this area\", she said,[39] referring to the area's recovery from the casualties and damage caused by the 2014 Oso mudslide. The bill passed both the House and the Senate.\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nMurray supports abortion rights. She opposed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill criminalizing abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, saying on the Senate floor: \"I oppose the fact that we are still voting on whether women and doctors are best equipped to make health care decisions — or politicians here in D. C.\"[40] She also voted against restricting US funding for UN family planning programs.[41]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Murray was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program\".[42]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Murray and 18 other Democratic senators sent USDA Inspector General (IG) Phyllis K. Fong a letter requesting that the IG investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserting that not to do so would mean these \"actions could be perceived as a part of this administration’s broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists\".[43]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Murray was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, asserting that the repeal's proposal used \"mathematical sleights of hand to overstate the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized\", and that denying science and fabricating math would fail to \"satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing\".[44]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Murray was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\".[45]\n\n\n\n### Federal budget[edit]\n\n\nOn December 10, 2013, Murray announced that she and Republican Representative Paul Ryan had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.[46]\n\n\nThe deal was scheduled to be voted on first in the House and then the Senate. Some believed House Democrats would pass the deal as a way to reduce the sequester cuts,[47] but the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Chris Van Hollen, said on December 12, 2013, that members of his party were outraged that House Republicans are planning to adjourn without addressing unemployment benefits.[48] Van Hollen said that \"it is too early to say\" whether a majority of House Democrats would vote for the budget bill.[48] The deal was also unpopular with many conservatives.[49]\n\n\nMurray put the controversial intelligence ports-data project Global Trade Exchange into the Homeland Security budget.[50]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Murray was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Trump, encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president, and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding's helping to improve conditions in those countries.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nMurray condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Murray voted for the ratification of New START,[53] a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.[54]\n\n\nIn December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Murray was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Major General Galen Jackman briefs Senator Patty Murray on the Manned Ground Vehicle program in Washington, D.C.\nIn October 2002, Murray was one of 21 Democrats in the Senate to vote against the War Authorization for invading Iraq. Quoted from her Senate speech:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Mr. President, if we do take action in Iraq, there is no doubt that our armed forces will prevail. We will win a war with Iraq decisively, and, God willing, we will win it quickly. But what happens after the war? That will have as big an impact on our future peace and security. Will we be obligated to rebuild Iraq? If so, how? Our economy is reeling, our budget is in deficit, and we have no estimate of the cost of rebuilding. And with whom? As *The New York Times* columnist Tom Friedman points out, there's a retail store mentality that suggests to some—if \"you break it, you buy it.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nIn December 2002, speaking to students at Columbia River High School in Vancouver, Murray made a number of remarks about Osama bin Laden as she attempted to explain why the US had such problems winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world, and how bin Laden had garnered support among some in the Middle East. Among other things, she said that bin Laden has \"been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building daycare facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. He's made their lives better. We have not done that.\" This attracted attention from political opponents, who argued that this was inaccurate and constituted support for bin Laden.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Murray introduced legislation in the Senate called The Emergency Contraception Access and Education Act. The bill would require hospitals that receive federal funding to provide rape victims with emergency contraception.[59] In July 2014, she introduced an amendment to a bill in the Senate to require health insurance plans to offer contraceptive coverage to patients regardless of employers' beliefs, religious or otherwise. Her amendment required 60 votes to move forward, and all but three Republicans voted against the measure.[60]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Murray was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steven Mnuchin, arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \"increase health care costs for millions of consumers, while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions\". The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress\".[61]\n\n\n\n### Labor[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Murray signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration initiate a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's that detailed workplace violence incidents, including interactions with customers such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms. The senators argued that McDonald's could and must \"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace\".[62]\n\n\nIn response to a February 2021 report by the Congressional Budget Office on the effects of a minimum wage increase,[63] Murray said: \"Today's report makes clear what we've known all along: raising the minimum wage — which hasn't increased since 2009 — to $15 an hour isn't just the right thing to do, it's good policy.\"[64] She was among the 42 Democrats to vote unsuccessfully to include a federal raise of the minimum wage to $15 per hour in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[65]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQIA+ rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Murray voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which banned federal recognition of same-sex marriage by limiting the definition of marriage to the union of a man and a woman.[66] DOMA was ruled unconstitutional in 2015, and later in 2023, she reversed her previous position and spoke in support of the Respect for Marriage Act, which officially repealed DOMA.[67]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Murray was one of 69 members of the House and Senate to sign a letter to then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Opioids[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Murray was one of 21 senators to sign a letter led by Ed Markey to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that noted that 12% of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form of substance abuse disorder, in addition to one third of treatment for opioid and other substance-use disorders in the United States being financed through Medicaid, and opined that the American Health Care Act could \"very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders\" due to the insurance coverage lacking adequate funds for care, often causing people to abandon treatment.[70]\n\n\n\n### Other positions[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Murray, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611).[71] The bill includes provisions to improve border security, increases fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, and creates a guest worker program (which includes an almost doubling of the number of H-1B visas)[72] and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.[73] The bill, with support from some in the GOP leadership, passed 62–36.\n\n\nMurray repeatedly cosponsored legislation to create the Wild Sky Wilderness area in the Washington Cascade Range.[74] She eventually succeeded, with the bill signed by President George W. Bush on May 8, 2008.[75] Murray has also supported legislation to increase the size of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, also in the Washington Cascades.[76]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2006, *The New York Times* wrote that, \"In 1994, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina was said to have engaged in excessive touching of his then-freshman colleague Patty Murray of Washington. *The Seattle Post-Intelligencer* reported that Murray asked for, and received, an apology. Through a spokeswoman, Murray declined to comment.\"[77]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2008, Murray endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries.[78] One month later, the Washington Democratic caucus awarded two-thirds of its delegates to Barack Obama and one-third to Clinton. After Clinton's June 7 concession, Murray endorsed Obama.[79]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Murray abstained from voting on the creation of the January 6 commission.[80] She cited a \"personal family matter\" for the abstention. Murray had expressed support for the commission and had talked about her experience on the day of the insurrection.[81]\n\n\n\n### Veterans[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Murray was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department, warning of some payday lenders \"offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law\", and asserting that service members, along with their families, \"deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound\".[82]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Murray was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie, calling it \"appalling that the VA is not conducting oversight of its own outreach efforts\", in spite of suicide prevention being the VA's highest clinical priority, and requesting Wilkie \"consult with experts with proven track records of successful public and mental health outreach campaigns, with a particular emphasis on how those individuals measure success\".[83]\n\n\n\n### Gun Control[edit]\n\n\nMurray supports gun control. She supports a national assault weapons ban.[84]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Washington State Senate District 1 election, 1988\n |\n| --- |\n| **Party** | **Candidate** | **Votes** | **%** | **±%** |\n| Democratic\n | **Patty Murray** | 22,948\n | 53%\n |  |\n| Republican\n | Bill Kiskaddon (inc.)\n | 20,480\n | 47%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. senator from Washington (Class III) results: 1992–2022[85]\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992 |  | **Patty Murray** | 1,197,973\n | 54%\n |  | Rod Chandler | 1,020,829\n | 46%\n |  |\n| 1998 |  | **Patty Murray** | 1,103,184\n | 58%\n |  | Linda Smith | 785,377\n | 42%\n |  |\n| 2004 |  | **Patty Murray** | 1,549,708\n | 55%\n |  | George Nethercutt | 1,204,584\n | 43%\n |  | J.

A member of the Democratic Party, Murray served in the Washington State Senate from 1989 to 1993. She was Washington's first female U.S. senator and is the first woman in American history to hold the position of president pro tempore. Murray is also the youngest senator to occupy the office of president pro tempore in more than five decades.[1] As president pro tempore, Murray is third in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency.[a]\n\n\nBorn and raised in Bothell, Washington, Murray graduated from Washington State University with a degree in physical education. She worked as a pre-school teacher and, later, as a parenting teacher at Shoreline Community College. A long-time advocate for environmental and education issues, Murray was elected to serve on her local school board in King County. She ran for the Washington State Senate in 1988, and defeated two-term incumbent Bill Kiskaddon. She served one term before launching a campaign for the United States Senate in 1992. She has been re-elected five times, most recently in 2022.\n\n\nAs a senator, Murray has been a part of party leadership since 2001, having served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Democratic Conference secretary, and assistant Democratic leader. She currently chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee. Before assuming her current roles, Murray has previously chaired at various times, the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the Budget Committee, and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Murray garnered national attention in 2013, when she and Republican representative Paul Ryan announced that they had negotiated a two-year, bipartisan budget, known as the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Murray is currently the third-most senior senator,[2] the most senior Senate Democrat, the second-longest serving woman to ever serve in the Senate, and the dean of Washington's congressional delegation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nOne of seven children, Murray was born in Bothell, Washington, a daughter of David L. Johns and Beverly A. McLaughlin.[3] Her mother was an accountant. Her father served in World War II and was awarded a Purple Heart. Her ancestry includes Welsh, Irish, Scottish, and French-Canadian.[3] When she was a teenager, her family was forced to apply for welfare assistance when her father became disabled due to multiple sclerosis. He had been the manager of a five-and-ten store.[4] Murray attended Saint Brendan Catholic School as a young child.\n\n\nMurray received a Bachelor of Arts degree in physical education from Washington State University in 1972.\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nMurray was a preschool teacher for several years, and taught a parenting class at Shoreline Community College from 1984 to 1987.[5] As a citizen-lobbyist for environmental and educational issues, Murray has said that a state representative once told her she could not make a difference because she was just a \"mom in tennis shoes\".[6] The phrase stuck, and she later used it in her successful campaigns for the Shoreline School District board of directors (1985–89), Washington State Senate (1989–93), and United States Senate (1993–present).[6] Murray was successful in gathering grassroots support to strike down proposed preschool program budget cuts.[7][8]\n\n\nIn 1988, Murray unseated two-term incumbent Republican state Senator Bill Kiskaddon.[9]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1993–present)[edit]\n\n\nMurray has served in the United States Senate since her election in 1992. For the 118th Congress in 2023, she was elected Senate president pro tempore; the office is usually held by the senior senator of the majority party, but Senator Dianne Feinstein (who was also elected in 1992, but took her seat a few months prior to Murray because she won a special election, rather than a regularly scheduled one) declined the post due to ailing health, leaving Murray the next in line for the position. Murray would ultimately become the most senior serving Democrat upon Feinstein's death in 2023. Murray is the first woman to hold the position.[10] As president pro tempore of the Senate, she is currently third in the United States presidential line of succession. Murray is also the current chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\n\nMurray is the first woman, and 33rd senator overall, to have cast 10,000 votes in the Senate, having reached the threshold on April 20, 2023.[11]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 1992[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1992 United States Senate election in Washington\n\nIn 1992, Murray announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate after *The Seattle Times* published a series of articles alleging that incumbent Democratic Senator Brock Adams had sexually assaulted a number of women.[12][13] Adams denied the allegations, but his popularity weakened considerably and he chose to retire rather than risk losing the seat for his party. Murray defeated Congressman Don Bonker for the Democratic nomination. In the general election she defeated Republican Congressman Rod Chandler, 54% to 46%, despite being outspent by a wide margin. Chandler seemed to have the upper hand in one of the debates until he responded to Murray's criticism for spending $120,000 on congressional mailings during rising unemployment and declining family income as part of an economic recession by quoting the Roger Miller song \"Dang Me\".[14] Chandler was further damaged by the unpopularity in the Pacific Northwest of President George H. W. Bush, who was largely blamed for the recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n1992 U.S. Senate primary in Washington[15]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Patty Murray**  | **318,455**  | **28.32%**  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Rod Chandler**  | **228,083**  | **20.28%**  |\n|  | Democratic | Don Bonker | 208,321\n | 18.52%\n |\n|  | Republican | Leo K.

Term limits became an issue in the campaign, as Democrats seized on Nethercutt's broken term-limits pledge that he had made when he unexpectedly unseated Speaker Tom Foley in 1994. Nethercutt was also hampered by his lack of name recognition in the more densely populated western part of the state, home to two-thirds of the state's population. Washington has not elected a senator from east of the Cascades since Miles Poindexter in 1916. Other important issues included national security and the war in Iraq. Nethercutt supported the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, while Murray opposed it. Nethercutt was a heavy underdog from the start and his campaign never gained much traction. Murray was reelected, 55% to 43%.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Democratic primary election results\n |\n| --- |\n| **Party** | **Candidate** | **Votes** | **%** |\n| Democratic\n | **Patty Murray** (incumbent)\n | **709,477** | **92.20** |\n| Democratic\n | Warren Hanson\n | 46,487\n | 6.04\n |\n| Democratic\n | Mohammad Said\n | 13,526\n | 1.76\n |\n\n\n\n\nGeneral election results[20]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Patty Murray (incumbent)**  | **1,549,708**  | **54.98**  |\n|  | Republican | George R.

In the August 17 primary, Murray appeared on the ballot alongside four other Democratic candidates, six Republican candidates, a Reform Party candidate and three independent candidates. She received a plurality, 46%, and advanced to the general election along with her main Republican challenger, former state Senator and two-time gubernatorial nominee Dino Rossi, who received 33%.[21][22] Leading up to the election, several prominent Washington State newspapers endorsed Murray.[23][24][25][26] Rossi conceded the election to Murray on November 4, 2010, two days after election day.

Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), launching an interactive website regarding the nomination of Judge John Roberts as the Chief Justice of the United States.\nMurray's committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:[35]\n\n\n\n* **Committee on Appropriations (chair)**\n\t+ As chair, Murray is an *ex officio* member of all subcommittees. Nevertheless, she also chairs the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies in an individual capacity.\n* Committee on the Budget\n* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* Committee on Veterans' Affairs\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Senate Oceans Caucus\n* Senate Aerospace Caucus\n* Afterschool Caucuses[36]\n* Congressional NextGen 9-1-1 Caucus[37]\n\n\n### Legislation[edit]\n\n\nOn February 28, 2013, Murray introduced the Green Mountain Lookout Heritage Protection Act into the Senate. The bill would prevent the United States Forest Service from removing a building from the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area in the state of Washington unless the agency determines that the structure is unsafe for visitors.[38] Murray argued that the bill should be passed in order to help the tourism industry in the area while protecting the lookout point in question.[39] The bill would be \"a very small step in what will be a very long recovery\" and would \"provide a glimmer of hope for the long-term recovery of this area\", she said,[39] referring to the area's recovery from the casualties and damage caused by the 2014 Oso mudslide. The bill passed both the House and the Senate.\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nMurray supports abortion rights. She opposed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill criminalizing abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, saying on the Senate floor: \"I oppose the fact that we are still voting on whether women and doctors are best equipped to make health care decisions — or politicians here in D. C.\"[40] She also voted against restricting US funding for UN family planning programs.[41]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Murray was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers \"have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices\" and urging his department to \"strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program\".[42]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Murray and 18 other Democratic senators sent USDA Inspector General (IG) Phyllis K. Fong a letter requesting that the IG investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making and asserting that not to do so would mean these \"actions could be perceived as a part of this administration’s broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists\".[43]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Murray was one of 19 senators to sign a letter to Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt questioning Pruitt's decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan, asserting that the repeal's proposal used \"mathematical sleights of hand to overstate the costs of industry compliance with the 2015 Rule and understate the benefits that will be lost if the 2017 repeal is finalized\", and that denying science and fabricating math would fail to \"satisfy the requirements of the law, nor will it slow the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the inexorable rise in sea levels, or the other dire effects of global warming that our planet is already experiencing\".[44]\n\n\nIn February 2019, in response to reports of the EPA intending to decide against setting drinking water limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the aforementioned class of chemicals, Murray was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler calling on the EPA \"to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\".[45]\n\n\n\n### Federal budget[edit]\n\n\nOn December 10, 2013, Murray announced that she and Republican Representative Paul Ryan had reached a compromise agreement on a two-year, bipartisan budget bill, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.[46]\n\n\nThe deal was scheduled to be voted on first in the House and then the Senate. Some believed House Democrats would pass the deal as a way to reduce the sequester cuts,[47] but the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, Chris Van Hollen, said on December 12, 2013, that members of his party were outraged that House Republicans are planning to adjourn without addressing unemployment benefits.[48] Van Hollen said that \"it is too early to say\" whether a majority of House Democrats would vote for the budget bill.[48] The deal was also unpopular with many conservatives.[49]\n\n\nMurray put the controversial intelligence ports-data project Global Trade Exchange into the Homeland Security budget.[50]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\n#### Central America[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Murray was one of 34 senators to sign a letter to President Trump, encouraging him \"to listen to members of your own Administration and reverse a decision that will damage our national security and aggravate conditions inside Central America\", asserting that Trump had \"consistently expressed a flawed understanding of U.S. foreign assistance\" since becoming president, and that he was \"personally undermining efforts to promote U.S. national security and economic prosperity\" through preventing the use of Fiscal Year 2018 national security funding. The senators argued that foreign assistance to Central American countries created less migration to the U.S., citing the funding's helping to improve conditions in those countries.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Myanmar[edit]\n\n\nMurray condemned the genocide of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and called for a stronger response to the crisis.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Murray voted for the ratification of New START,[53] a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.[54]\n\n\nIn December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration was suspending its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days in the event that Russia continued to violate the treaty, Murray was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration \"now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America's nuclear-armed adversaries\" and calling on Trump to continue arms negotiations.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Major General Galen Jackman briefs Senator Patty Murray on the Manned Ground Vehicle program in Washington, D.C.\nIn October 2002, Murray was one of 21 Democrats in the Senate to vote against the War Authorization for invading Iraq. Quoted from her Senate speech:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Mr. President, if we do take action in Iraq, there is no doubt that our armed forces will prevail. We will win a war with Iraq decisively, and, God willing, we will win it quickly. But what happens after the war? That will have as big an impact on our future peace and security. Will we be obligated to rebuild Iraq? If so, how? Our economy is reeling, our budget is in deficit, and we have no estimate of the cost of rebuilding. And with whom? As *The New York Times* columnist Tom Friedman points out, there's a retail store mentality that suggests to some—if \"you break it, you buy it.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nIn December 2002, speaking to students at Columbia River High School in Vancouver, Murray made a number of remarks about Osama bin Laden as she attempted to explain why the US had such problems winning hearts and minds in the Muslim world, and how bin Laden had garnered support among some in the Middle East. Among other things, she said that bin Laden has \"been out in these countries for decades, building schools, building roads, building infrastructure, building daycare facilities, building health care facilities, and the people are extremely grateful. He's made their lives better. We have not done that.\" This attracted attention from political opponents, who argued that this was inaccurate and constituted support for bin Laden.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Murray introduced legislation in the Senate called The Emergency Contraception Access and Education Act. The bill would require hospitals that receive federal funding to provide rape victims with emergency contraception.[59] In July 2014, she introduced an amendment to a bill in the Senate to require health insurance plans to offer contraceptive coverage to patients regardless of employers' beliefs, religious or otherwise. Her amendment required 60 votes to move forward, and all but three Republicans voted against the measure.[60]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Murray was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steven Mnuchin, arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to \"increase health care costs for millions of consumers, while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions\". The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and \"re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress\".[61]\n\n\n\n### Labor[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Murray signed a letter to United States Secretary of Labor Alexander Acosta that advocated that the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration initiate a full investigation into a complaint filed on May 20 by a group of Chicago-area employees of McDonald's that detailed workplace violence incidents, including interactions with customers such as customers throwing hot coffee and threatening employees with firearms. The senators argued that McDonald's could and must \"do more to protect its employees, but employers will not take seriously their obligations to provide a safe workplace if OSHA does not enforce workers rights to a hazard-free workplace\".[62]\n\n\nIn response to a February 2021 report by the Congressional Budget Office on the effects of a minimum wage increase,[63] Murray said: \"Today's report makes clear what we've known all along: raising the minimum wage — which hasn't increased since 2009 — to $15 an hour isn't just the right thing to do, it's good policy.\"[64] She was among the 42 Democrats to vote unsuccessfully to include a federal raise of the minimum wage to $15 per hour in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.[65]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQIA+ rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Murray voted for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which banned federal recognition of same-sex marriage by limiting the definition of marriage to the union of a man and a woman.[66] DOMA was ruled unconstitutional in 2015, and later in 2023, she reversed her previous position and spoke in support of the Respect for Marriage Act, which officially repealed DOMA.[67]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Murray was one of 69 members of the House and Senate to sign a letter to then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding five years.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Opioids[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Murray was one of 21 senators to sign a letter led by Ed Markey to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that noted that 12% of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form of substance abuse disorder, in addition to one third of treatment for opioid and other substance-use disorders in the United States being financed through Medicaid, and opined that the American Health Care Act could \"very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders\" due to the insurance coverage lacking adequate funds for care, often causing people to abandon treatment.[70]\n\n\n\n### Other positions[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2006, Murray, along with 38 of 44 Senate Democrats, voted in favor of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611).[71] The bill includes provisions to improve border security, increases fines and other punishments for employers of illegal immigrants, and creates a guest worker program (which includes an almost doubling of the number of H-1B visas)[72] and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants already in the country.[73] The bill, with support from some in the GOP leadership, passed 62–36.\n\n\nMurray repeatedly cosponsored legislation to create the Wild Sky Wilderness area in the Washington Cascade Range.[74] She eventually succeeded, with the bill signed by President George W. Bush on May 8, 2008.[75] Murray has also supported legislation to increase the size of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, also in the Washington Cascades.[76]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2006, *The New York Times* wrote that, \"In 1994, Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina was said to have engaged in excessive touching of his then-freshman colleague Patty Murray of Washington. *The Seattle Post-Intelligencer* reported that Murray asked for, and received, an apology. Through a spokeswoman, Murray declined to comment.\"[77]\n\n\nOn January 30, 2008, Murray endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries.[78] One month later, the Washington Democratic caucus awarded two-thirds of its delegates to Barack Obama and one-third to Clinton. After Clinton's June 7 concession, Murray endorsed Obama.[79]\n\n\nOn May 28, 2021, Murray abstained from voting on the creation of the January 6 commission.[80] She cited a \"personal family matter\" for the abstention. Murray had expressed support for the commission and had talked about her experience on the day of the insurrection.[81]\n\n\n\n### Veterans[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Murray was one of 23 Democratic senators to sign a letter to the Defense Department, warning of some payday lenders \"offering predatory loan products to service members at exorbitant triple digit effective interest rates and loan products that do not include the additional protections envisioned by the law\", and asserting that service members, along with their families, \"deserve the strongest possible protections and swift action to ensure that all forms of credit offered to members of our armed forces are safe and sound\".[82]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Murray was one of 21 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie, calling it \"appalling that the VA is not conducting oversight of its own outreach efforts\", in spite of suicide prevention being the VA's highest clinical priority, and requesting Wilkie \"consult with experts with proven track records of successful public and mental health outreach campaigns, with a particular emphasis on how those individuals measure success\".[83]\n\n\n\n### Gun Control[edit]\n\n\nMurray supports gun control. She supports a national assault weapons ban.[84]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Washington State Senate District 1 election, 1988\n |\n| --- |\n| **Party** | **Candidate** | **Votes** | **%** | **±%** |\n| Democratic\n | **Patty Murray** | 22,948\n | 53%\n |  |\n| Republican\n | Bill Kiskaddon (inc.)\n | 20,480\n | 47%\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nU.S. senator from Washington (Class III) results: 1992–2022[85]\n| Year\n |  | Democratic\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | Republican\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  | 3rd Party\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Pct\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992 |  | **Patty Murray** | 1,197,973\n | 54%\n |  | Rod Chandler | 1,020,829\n | 46%\n |  |\n| 1998 |  | **Patty Murray** | 1,103,184\n | 58%\n |  | Linda Smith | 785,377\n | 42%\n |  |\n| 2004 |  | **Patty Murray** | 1,549,708\n | 55%\n |  | George Nethercutt | 1,204,584\n | 43%\n |  | J.

A member of the Republican Party, Britt is the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama and the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Senate.[1] She was president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama from 2019 to 2021, and was chief of staff for her Senate predecessor, Richard Shelby, from 2016 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBritt was born as Katie Elizabeth Boyd[2] to Julian and Debra Boyd on February 2, 1982,[3][4] in the city of Enterprise.[5] She was raised outside Fort Rucker in Dale County, Alabama, and worked at her family's small business throughout her youth.[6] In her youth, she was an attendee of the Girls State leadership program, and was elected to a governor position at the conference in 1999.[7] A graduate of Enterprise High School, Britt was a cheerleader there and one of 19 valedictorians upon graduation in 2000.[2] She enrolled at the University of Alabama, where she majored in political science and was elected president of its Student Government Association.[8] She graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 2013, she received a Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama School of Law.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## Law and business career[edit]\n\n\nAfter she graduated from the University of Alabama,[11] Britt joined the staff of U.S. Senator Richard Shelby in May 2004 as deputy press secretary. She was later promoted to press secretary.[12] In 2007, she left Shelby's staff and worked as a special assistant to University of Alabama president Robert Witt. At the University of Alabama School of Law, she participated in Tax Moot Court.[13]\n\n\nAfter law school, Britt first worked at Johnston Barton Proctor & Rose LLP in Birmingham.[13] When the firm shut down in March 2014, Britt and 17 other former employees joined the Birmingham office of Butler Snow LLP.[14] She founded the firm's government affairs branch. In November 2015, Britt took a leave of absence from Butler Snow to return to Shelby's staff, working on his reelection campaign as deputy campaign manager and communications director.[15][16]\n\n\nIn 2016, Shelby named Britt his chief of staff.[16] She became a top advisor to Shelby and head of his Judicial Nomination Task Force.[10] In May 2016, *Yellowhammer News* named Britt one of \"the people who will be running Alabama in a few years\".[17]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Britt was selected as president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, effective January 2;[18] she was the first woman to lead the organization.[19] As head of what *Alabama Daily News* called one of the state's \"most influential political organizations\", she focused on workforce and economic development through tax incentives, and addressed the state's prison system and participation in the 2020 United States census.[20] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Britt led a \"Keep Alabama Open\" effort to self-govern business affairs by avoiding shutdowns and maintain employment.[21] In April 2021, she was elected to the Alabama Wildlife Federation's board of directors.[22] Britt resigned from her positions at the Business Council of Alabama in June 2021, amid media speculation that she would run for the U.S. Senate.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Britt and her family at her inauguration with Vice President Kamala Harris, 2023\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Alabama\n\nOn June 8, 2021, Britt announced her candidacy in the Republican primary for the 2022 Senate election in Alabama.[26][27] Britt, who had never previously run for public office, started out the race polling at 2%, but gradually climbed in the polls as the race went on.[28]\n\n\nAs a Senate candidate, Britt publicly aligned herself with former President Donald Trump.[29] Although Britt gave credence to Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, she has never outright claimed the election was \"stolen\".[30] She advanced to a runoff in the Republican primary against Representative Mo Brooks. Trump officially endorsed Britt on June 10, 2022, calling her a \"fearless America First warrior\". He had previously withdrawn an endorsement of Brooks.[31] Britt defeated Brooks in the runoff on June 21, 2022, with 63% of the vote. She then handily won the general election on November 8.[7][32]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Britt became the first woman elected a U.S. senator from Alabama (previous female U.S. senators from Alabama had been appointed to the position).[33] She was also the youngest Republican woman elected U.S. senator and the second-youngest woman overall (Democrat Blanche Lincoln being the youngest).[34]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBritt took office on January 3, 2023. Following leadership elections for the 118th United States Congress, she did not say whether she supported Mitch McConnell or Rick Scott for Senate Minority Leader.[35] Before taking office, Britt was selected as the only incoming senator to serve on the newly formed Republican Party Advisory Council of the Republican National Committee.[36]\n\n\nBritt's first vote in the U.S. Senate was opposing a Biden administration nominee to a Department of Defense position.[37] During her first month in office, she co-sponsored eight bills and visited the Mexico–United States border twice.[38] She continued these visits to the border while co-sponsoring bills to curtail illegal immigration, as well as funding for a border wall.[39]\n\n\nIn February 2023, *CoinDesk* reported that Britt was one of three members of Alabama's congressional delegation who received money from FTX, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, alongside Robert Aderholt and Gary Palmer. Britt's office responded to an inquiry from *CoinDesk* by stating that the money had been donated back.[40] As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Britt joined 22 other senators in March 2023 in calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring a balanced budget each year, while also criticizing the Biden administration's budgetary plans.[41]\n\n\nThe same month, Britt advocated for Huntsville, Alabama, to remain as primary location of the United States Space Command. The Biden administration had previously indicated it was considering relocating it to Colorado, even though a U.S. Air Force study found Colorado to be the fifth-best location. Britt charged that the Biden administration was \"politicizing\" the decision, saying that \"selecting a fifth-place finisher would obviously prioritize partisan political considerations at the expense of our national security, military modernization and force readiness\".[42]\n\n\nIn March 2023, after Mexican law enforcement occupied a port in Quintana Roo, Mexico, owned by the Birmingham-based Vulcan Materials Company, Britt joined other members of Alabama's congressional delegation in negotiating the forces' withdrawal.[43] Britt called the takeover unlawful[44] and met with Mexican officials at the Washington, D.C. embassy, condemning the actions taken at the port.[43] The Mexican personnel withdrew from the port by the end of the month.[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, Britt voted against the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. In a statement issued after the vote, Britt said, \"we must do more\", having wanted more spending cuts than were in the bill.[46]\n\n\n**Committee assignments**[47]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation and Community Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n**Caucuses**\n\n\n\n* Senate Republican Conference\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Britt with radio host Joey Clark in 2021\nBritt holds conservative views.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBritt identifies herself as pro-life, a stance that was scrutinized during the 2022 U.S. Senate election. Her initial television advertisements emphasized her view on abortion, asserting that life begins at conception and equating late-term abortions to murder. But in May 2022, just before the first round of the Republican primary, rival candidate Michael Durant criticized Britt's abortion stance. He pointed out a resolution passed by the Student Senate while she was president of the University of Alabama Student Government Association that demanded that morning-after pills be made available at the university health center's pharmacy, which was already prescribing the pills at the time. In response, Britt's campaign claimed she neither supported nor voted on the resolution and was unable to veto it due to the limitations of her position. The *Alabama Political Reporter* corroborated these statements based on *The Crimson White* articles from the time of Britt's presidency. Furthermore, Britt's campaign insisted she would \"uphold the sanctity of life\" if elected senator.[50]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Britt supported a motion from Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to ban the teaching of critical race theory in public schools.[51] She has been called a \"vocal proponent\" of school choice by *Yellowhammer News*.[52]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nBritt is a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. In August 2022, she charged the Biden administration with inaction and \"total weakness\" in regard to China, highlighting humanitarian crises in China, as well as its dominance in manufacturing, saying that China was \"taking jobs\".[53] In September 2022, she accused the social media platform TikTok of being a \"Trojan horse\" for the Chinese Communist Party; other American lawmakers have expressed similar concern about TikTok as a potential security threat.[54] In October 2022, Britt pledged to co-sponsor a bill introduced by Senators Tommy Tuberville and Tom Cotton to keep Chinese-owned companies from purchasing American farmland.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gun rights[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the passing of the Protecting Our Kids Act in June 2022, Britt told *1819 News* that she believes red flag laws are a \"gateway to push [a] disarming agenda\". She opposes gun laws that she says infringe on the Second Amendment.[56] She has called the Second Amendment \"a critical check against the timeless tyranny of government\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Britt wrote a column calling for an open discussion and prioritization of mental health. Her column also expressed her wish to combat the opioid epidemic and suicide rates in the United States.[58] In May 2022, Britt called \"affordable access to quality mental health care and resources\" a \"major component\" of her Senate campaign's platform. She supports efforts to eliminate the stigmatization of mental illness.[59]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBritt supports reducing legal immigration \"to a sensible level\" and prioritizing skills and merit over family associations. She has said she will introduce legislation to prevent birthright citizenship from applying to children whose parents entered the country illegally. She also supports and has pledged to sponsor the RAISE Act, first introduced by Senator Tom Cotton in 2017.[60]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nFollowing her election to the U.S. Senate, Britt named expansion of broadband access as one of her areas of focus.[28] After the release of the Twitter Files in December 2022, Britt joined Alabama representatives Jerry Carl and Barry Moore in calling for reform to Section 230, specifically criticizing Big Tech and saying that she was looking forward to congressional hearings \"getting to the bottom of what occurred at Twitter in 2020\".[61]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[edit]\n\n\nBritt was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[62]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKatie Britt is married to Wesley Britt, a former NFL player. They met while attending the University of Alabama,[63] and married on March 8, 2008.[64] They reside in Montgomery, Alabama, and have two children.[65] The Britts attend First United Methodist Church in Montgomery.[66]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, Republican primary results[67]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **289,425**  | **44.8**  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Mo Brooks**  | **188,539**  | **29.2**  |\n|  | Republican | Michael Durant | 150,817\n | 23.3\n |\n|  | Republican | Jake Schafer\n | 7,371\n | 1.1\n |\n|  | Republican | Karla DuPriest\n | 5,739\n | 0.9\n |\n|  | Republican | Lillie Boddie\n | 4,849\n | 0.7\n |\n| Total votes\n | **646,740**  | **100.0**  |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, Republican primary runoff results[68]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **253,251**  | **63.0**  |\n|  | Republican | Mo Brooks | 148,636\n | 37.0\n |\n| Total votes\n | **401,887**  | **100.0**  |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, general election results[69]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **940,048**  | **66.64**  | **+2.68**  |\n|  | Democratic | Will Boyd\n | 435,428\n | 30.87\n | -5.00\n |\n|  | Libertarian | John Sophocleus | 32,790\n | 2.32\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 2,454\n | 0.17\n | +0.00\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,410,720**  | **100.00**  |  |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cason, Mike (November 9, 2022). \"Katie Britt wins: Makes history, becomes Alabama's 1st woman elected to U.S. Senate\". *al*.

A member of the Republican Party, Britt is the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama and the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Senate.[1] She was president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama from 2019 to 2021, and was chief of staff for her Senate predecessor, Richard Shelby, from 2016 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBritt was born as Katie Elizabeth Boyd[2] to Julian and Debra Boyd on February 2, 1982,[3][4] in the city of Enterprise.[5] She was raised outside Fort Rucker in Dale County, Alabama, and worked at her family's small business throughout her youth.[6] In her youth, she was an attendee of the Girls State leadership program, and was elected to a governor position at the conference in 1999.[7] A graduate of Enterprise High School, Britt was a cheerleader there and one of 19 valedictorians upon graduation in 2000.[2] She enrolled at the University of Alabama, where she majored in political science and was elected president of its Student Government Association.[8] She graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 2013, she received a Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama School of Law.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## Law and business career[edit]\n\n\nAfter she graduated from the University of Alabama,[11] Britt joined the staff of U.S. Senator Richard Shelby in May 2004 as deputy press secretary. She was later promoted to press secretary.[12] In 2007, she left Shelby's staff and worked as a special assistant to University of Alabama president Robert Witt. At the University of Alabama School of Law, she participated in Tax Moot Court.[13]\n\n\nAfter law school, Britt first worked at Johnston Barton Proctor & Rose LLP in Birmingham.[13] When the firm shut down in March 2014, Britt and 17 other former employees joined the Birmingham office of Butler Snow LLP.[14] She founded the firm's government affairs branch. In November 2015, Britt took a leave of absence from Butler Snow to return to Shelby's staff, working on his reelection campaign as deputy campaign manager and communications director.[15][16]\n\n\nIn 2016, Shelby named Britt his chief of staff.[16] She became a top advisor to Shelby and head of his Judicial Nomination Task Force.[10] In May 2016, *Yellowhammer News* named Britt one of \"the people who will be running Alabama in a few years\".[17]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Britt was selected as president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, effective January 2;[18] she was the first woman to lead the organization.[19] As head of what *Alabama Daily News* called one of the state's \"most influential political organizations\", she focused on workforce and economic development through tax incentives, and addressed the state's prison system and participation in the 2020 United States census.[20] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Britt led a \"Keep Alabama Open\" effort to self-govern business affairs by avoiding shutdowns and maintain employment.[21] In April 2021, she was elected to the Alabama Wildlife Federation's board of directors.[22] Britt resigned from her positions at the Business Council of Alabama in June 2021, amid media speculation that she would run for the U.S. Senate.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Britt and her family at her inauguration with Vice President Kamala Harris, 2023\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Alabama\n\nOn June 8, 2021, Britt announced her candidacy in the Republican primary for the 2022 Senate election in Alabama.[26][27] Britt, who had never previously run for public office, started out the race polling at 2%, but gradually climbed in the polls as the race went on.[28]\n\n\nAs a Senate candidate, Britt publicly aligned herself with former President Donald Trump.[29] Although Britt gave credence to Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, she has never outright claimed the election was \"stolen\".[30] She advanced to a runoff in the Republican primary against Representative Mo Brooks. Trump officially endorsed Britt on June 10, 2022, calling her a \"fearless America First warrior\". He had previously withdrawn an endorsement of Brooks.[31] Britt defeated Brooks in the runoff on June 21, 2022, with 63% of the vote. She then handily won the general election on November 8.[7][32]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Britt became the first woman elected a U.S. senator from Alabama (previous female U.S. senators from Alabama had been appointed to the position).[33] She was also the youngest Republican woman elected U.S. senator and the second-youngest woman overall (Democrat Blanche Lincoln being the youngest).[34]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBritt took office on January 3, 2023. Following leadership elections for the 118th United States Congress, she did not say whether she supported Mitch McConnell or Rick Scott for Senate Minority Leader.[35] Before taking office, Britt was selected as the only incoming senator to serve on the newly formed Republican Party Advisory Council of the Republican National Committee.[36]\n\n\nBritt's first vote in the U.S. Senate was opposing a Biden administration nominee to a Department of Defense position.[37] During her first month in office, she co-sponsored eight bills and visited the Mexico–United States border twice.[38] She continued these visits to the border while co-sponsoring bills to curtail illegal immigration, as well as funding for a border wall.[39]\n\n\nIn February 2023, *CoinDesk* reported that Britt was one of three members of Alabama's congressional delegation who received money from FTX, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, alongside Robert Aderholt and Gary Palmer. Britt's office responded to an inquiry from *CoinDesk* by stating that the money had been donated back.[40] As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Britt joined 22 other senators in March 2023 in calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring a balanced budget each year, while also criticizing the Biden administration's budgetary plans.[41]\n\n\nThe same month, Britt advocated for Huntsville, Alabama, to remain as primary location of the United States Space Command. The Biden administration had previously indicated it was considering relocating it to Colorado, even though a U.S. Air Force study found Colorado to be the fifth-best location. Britt charged that the Biden administration was \"politicizing\" the decision, saying that \"selecting a fifth-place finisher would obviously prioritize partisan political considerations at the expense of our national security, military modernization and force readiness\".[42]\n\n\nIn March 2023, after Mexican law enforcement occupied a port in Quintana Roo, Mexico, owned by the Birmingham-based Vulcan Materials Company, Britt joined other members of Alabama's congressional delegation in negotiating the forces' withdrawal.[43] Britt called the takeover unlawful[44] and met with Mexican officials at the Washington, D.C. embassy, condemning the actions taken at the port.[43] The Mexican personnel withdrew from the port by the end of the month.[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, Britt voted against the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. In a statement issued after the vote, Britt said, \"we must do more\", having wanted more spending cuts than were in the bill.[46]\n\n\n**Committee assignments**[47]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation and Community Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n**Caucuses**\n\n\n\n* Senate Republican Conference\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Britt with radio host Joey Clark in 2021\nBritt holds conservative views.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBritt identifies herself as pro-life, a stance that was scrutinized during the 2022 U.S. Senate election. Her initial television advertisements emphasized her view on abortion, asserting that life begins at conception and equating late-term abortions to murder. But in May 2022, just before the first round of the Republican primary, rival candidate Michael Durant criticized Britt's abortion stance. He pointed out a resolution passed by the Student Senate while she was president of the University of Alabama Student Government Association that demanded that morning-after pills be made available at the university health center's pharmacy, which was already prescribing the pills at the time. In response, Britt's campaign claimed she neither supported nor voted on the resolution and was unable to veto it due to the limitations of her position. The *Alabama Political Reporter* corroborated these statements based on *The Crimson White* articles from the time of Britt's presidency. Furthermore, Britt's campaign insisted she would \"uphold the sanctity of life\" if elected senator.[50]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Britt supported a motion from Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to ban the teaching of critical race theory in public schools.[51] She has been called a \"vocal proponent\" of school choice by *Yellowhammer News*.[52]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nBritt is a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. In August 2022, she charged the Biden administration with inaction and \"total weakness\" in regard to China, highlighting humanitarian crises in China, as well as its dominance in manufacturing, saying that China was \"taking jobs\".[53] In September 2022, she accused the social media platform TikTok of being a \"Trojan horse\" for the Chinese Communist Party; other American lawmakers have expressed similar concern about TikTok as a potential security threat.[54] In October 2022, Britt pledged to co-sponsor a bill introduced by Senators Tommy Tuberville and Tom Cotton to keep Chinese-owned companies from purchasing American farmland.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gun rights[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the passing of the Protecting Our Kids Act in June 2022, Britt told *1819 News* that she believes red flag laws are a \"gateway to push [a] disarming agenda\". She opposes gun laws that she says infringe on the Second Amendment.[56] She has called the Second Amendment \"a critical check against the timeless tyranny of government\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Britt wrote a column calling for an open discussion and prioritization of mental health. Her column also expressed her wish to combat the opioid epidemic and suicide rates in the United States.[58] In May 2022, Britt called \"affordable access to quality mental health care and resources\" a \"major component\" of her Senate campaign's platform. She supports efforts to eliminate the stigmatization of mental illness.[59]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBritt supports reducing legal immigration \"to a sensible level\" and prioritizing skills and merit over family associations. She has said she will introduce legislation to prevent birthright citizenship from applying to children whose parents entered the country illegally. She also supports and has pledged to sponsor the RAISE Act, first introduced by Senator Tom Cotton in 2017.[60]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nFollowing her election to the U.S. Senate, Britt named expansion of broadband access as one of her areas of focus.[28] After the release of the Twitter Files in December 2022, Britt joined Alabama representatives Jerry Carl and Barry Moore in calling for reform to Section 230, specifically criticizing Big Tech and saying that she was looking forward to congressional hearings \"getting to the bottom of what occurred at Twitter in 2020\".[61]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[edit]\n\n\nBritt was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[62]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKatie Britt is married to Wesley Britt, a former NFL player. They met while attending the University of Alabama,[63] and married on March 8, 2008.[64] They reside in Montgomery, Alabama, and have two children.[65] The Britts attend First United Methodist Church in Montgomery.[66]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, Republican primary results[67]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **289,425**  | **44.8**  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Mo Brooks**  | **188,539**  | **29.2**  |\n|  | Republican | Michael Durant | 150,817\n | 23.3\n |\n|  | Republican | Jake Schafer\n | 7,371\n | 1.1\n |\n|  | Republican | Karla DuPriest\n | 5,739\n | 0.9\n |\n|  | Republican | Lillie Boddie\n | 4,849\n | 0.7\n |\n| Total votes\n | **646,740**  | **100.0**  |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, Republican primary runoff results[68]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **253,251**  | **63.0**  |\n|  | Republican | Mo Brooks | 148,636\n | 37.0\n |\n| Total votes\n | **401,887**  | **100.0**  |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, general election results[69]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **940,048**  | **66.64**  | **+2.68**  |\n|  | Democratic | Will Boyd\n | 435,428\n | 30.87\n | -5.00\n |\n|  | Libertarian | John Sophocleus | 32,790\n | 2.32\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 2,454\n | 0.17\n | +0.00\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,410,720**  | **100.00**  |  |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cason, Mike (November 9, 2022). \"Katie Britt wins: Makes history, becomes Alabama's 1st woman elected to U.S. Senate\". *al*.
