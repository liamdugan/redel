Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, through 2022.\n\n\nA1The adjusted gross for *Avatar* includes revenue from the original release and all four reissues. The original release and 2010 Special Edition grosses are adjusted from the Guinness base year, whilst the 2020 and 2021 grosses are adjusted from the 2021 index and the 2022 gross from 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gone with the Wind* is likewise represented twice on the chart: the 1940 entry includes earnings from its staggered 1939–1942 release (roadshow/​general release/​second-run)[86] along with all of its revenue up to the 1961 reissue prior to losing the record to *The Sound of Music* in 1966; its 1971 entry—after it took back the record—includes income from the 1967 and 1971 reissues but omitting later releases. *The Godfather* was re-released in 1973 after its success at the 45th Academy Awards, and *Jaws* was released again in 1976, and their grosses here most likely include earnings from those releases. *The Sound of Music*, *The Godfather*, *Jaws*, *Jurassic Park*, and *Titanic* increased their earnings with further releases in 1973, 1997, 1979, 2013, and 2012, respectively, but they are not included in the totals here because they had already conceded the record prior to being re-released.\n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline of the highest-grossing film record\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSteven Spielberg is the most represented director on the chart, with six films to his credit, occupying the top spot in 1975, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989 and 1993. Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Shearer, Lloyd (October 26, 1947). \"GWTW: Supercolossal Saga of an Epic\". *The New York Times*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Original release: \"Back to the Future (1985)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*: \"Domestic Rentals: $29.2; Foreign Rentals: $7.9; Production Cost: $6.6 (Initial Release – Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n211. **^** *Lawrence of Arabia*\n\n\t* 1962 release: \"Lawrence of Arabia\". *The Numbers*.

Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box-office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[30] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.[26] As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a \"top film of all time\",[24][31] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total up to 2014: \"The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The prints were battered, but the studio believed one final fling for GWTW was possible. The film returned to movie theaters for the third time in the spring of 1942 and stayed in release until late 1943 ... When MGM finally pulled the film from exhibition, all worn-out prints were destroyed, and GWTW was at last declared out of circulation. MGM, which by then had sole ownership of the film, announced that GWTW had grossed over $32 million.\n87. **^** Dick, Bernard F.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32 million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Barrios, Richard (1995). *A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film*.

Since it's rarely seen today, *The Singing Fool* is frequently confused with *The Jazz Singer*; although besides Jolson and a pervasively maudlin air the two have little in common. In the earlier film Jolson was inordinately attached to his mother and sang \"Mammy\"; here the fixation was on his young son, and \"Sonny Boy\" became an enormous hit. So did the film, which amassed a stunning world-wide gross of $5.9 million...Some sources give it as the highest gross of *any* film in its initial release prior to *Gone with the Wind*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

Cecil B. DeMille (1932, 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1956) is in second place with five films and William Wyler (1942, 1946, 1959 and 1968) and James Cameron (1991, 1997, 2009 and 2022) are tied for third place with four films. D. W. Griffith (1915, 1916 and 1920), George Roy Hill (1966, 1969 and 1973) and the Russo brothers (2016, 2018 and 2019) all feature heavily with three films apiece. George Lucas directed two chart-toppers in 1977 and 1999, but also served in a strong creative capacity as a producer and writer in 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984 and 1989 as well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n† *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n97. **^** Tartaglione, Nancy (March 13, 2021). \"'Avatar' Overtakes 'Avengers: Endgame' As All-Time Highest-Grossing Film At Global Box Office; China Reissue Growing\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The methodology is based on the concept that films associated with things audiences are already familiar with can be more effectively marketed to them, and as such are known as \"pre-sold\" films within the industry.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n58. **^** Shearer, Lloyd (October 26, 1947). \"GWTW: Supercolossal Saga of an Epic\". *The New York Times*.

Putting *The Birth of a Nation* in fifth place is open to question, since it is generally conceded to be the top-grossing film of all time. However, it has always been difficult to obtain reliable box-office figures for this film, and it may have been even more difficult in the mid-1930s. After listing it until the mid-1970s as *the* top-grosser, though finding it impossible to quote exact figures, *Variety*, the trade journal, suddenly repudiated the claim but without giving specific details or reasons. On the basis of the number of paid admissions, and *continuous* exhibition, its number one position seems justified.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Original release: \"Back to the Future (1985)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid*: \"Domestic Rentals: $29.2; Foreign Rentals: $7.9; Production Cost: $6.6 (Initial Release – Unadjusted $s in Millions of $s).\"\n211. **^** *Lawrence of Arabia*\n\n\t* 1962 release: \"Lawrence of Arabia\". *The Numbers*.

Since *Variety* at the time ranked films by their U.S. and Canadian rental, they constructed a hypothetical rental figure for the Cinerama films to provide a basis for comparison to other films in their chart: in the case of *This Is Cinerama*, the $50 million worldwide gross was reconfigured as a $12.5 million U.S. rental gross; this is exactly 25% of the amount reported by Cinerama, so *Variety*'s formula seemingly halved the gross to obtain an estimate for the U.S. share, and halved it again to simulate a rental fee.[62] All five Cinerama features collectively generated $120 million in worldwide box office receipts.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe measuring system for gauging a film's success is based on unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this is the way it has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box-office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media.[30] Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals.[26] As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a \"top film of all time\",[24][31] so there is little incentive to switch to a more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total up to 2014: \"The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The prints were battered, but the studio believed one final fling for GWTW was possible. The film returned to movie theaters for the third time in the spring of 1942 and stayed in release until late 1943 ... When MGM finally pulled the film from exhibition, all worn-out prints were destroyed, and GWTW was at last declared out of circulation. MGM, which by then had sole ownership of the film, announced that GWTW had grossed over $32 million.\n87. **^** Dick, Bernard F.

Contemporary accounts often list it as earning $32 million in North American rentals and retrospective charts have often duplicated this claim; however, it is likely this was the worldwide rental figure. Trade journals would collate the data by either obtaining it from the distributors themselves, who were keen to promote a successful film, or by surveying theaters and constructing an estimate. Distributors would often report the worldwide rental since the higher figure made the film appear more successful, while estimates were limited to performance in North America; therefore it was not unusual for worldwide and North American rentals to be mixed up. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Barrios, Richard (1995). *A Song in the Dark: The Birth of the Musical Film*. Oxford University Press. p. 49. ISBN 978-0-19-508811-3. Since it's rarely seen today, *The Singing Fool* is frequently confused with *The Jazz Singer*; although besides Jolson and a pervasively maudlin air the two have little in common. In the earlier film Jolson was inordinately attached to his mother and sang \"Mammy\"; here the fixation was on his young son, and \"Sonny Boy\" became an enormous hit. So did the film, which amassed a stunning world-wide gross of $5.9 million...Some sources give it as the highest gross of *any* film in its initial release prior to *Gone with the Wind*. This is probably overstating it—MGM's records show that *Ben-Hur* and *The Big Parade* grossed more, and no one knows just how much *The Birth of a Nation* brought in. Still, by the standards of the time it's an amazing amount.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* \"Frozen (2013) – International Box Office Results\". *Box Office Mojo*.

During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with *The Birth of a Nation* (American Civil War), *The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse*, *The Big Parade* and *Wings* (all World War I) becoming the most successful films in their respective years of release, with the trend coming to an end with *All Quiet on the Western Front* in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war-themed films dominate again during this period, starting with *Gone with the Wind* (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with *The Best Years of Our Lives* (World War II) in 1946. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUNChopra-Gant stipulates that the figure given for *Unconquered* is for North American box-office, but as was common at the time, the chart confuses worldwide and North American grosses.

Manchester University Press. pp. 94–95. ISBN 978-0-7190-4853-1. *Mrs Miniver* was a phenomenon. It was the most popular film of the year (from any studio) in both North America and Britain, and its foreign earnings were three times higher than those of any other MGM film released in the 1941–42 season. The production cost ($1,344,000) was one of the highest of the season, indicating the studio never thought of the film as a potential loss-maker. When the film earned a worldwide gross of $8,878,000, MGM had the highest profit ($4,831,000) in its history. *Random Harvest* nearly matched the success of *Mrs Miniver* with worldwide earnings of $8,147,000 yielding the second-highest profit in MGM's history ($4,384,000). *Random Harvest* was also the most popular film of the year in Britain, where it proved to be even more popular than Britain's most acclaimed war film, *In Which We Serve*.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Ben-Hur (1959) – Notes\".

It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity, or spirit on Earth.[1][2] The relative verb to \"alight, to make one's appearance\" is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.[3][4]\n\n\nThe word *avatar* does not appear in the Vedic literature;[5] however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE.[6] Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The *Rigveda* describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.[7][8] The *Bhagavad Gita* expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than *avatar*.[6][4]\n\n\nTheologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities.[9] Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the *Garuda Purana* and the twenty-two avatars in the *Bhagavata Purana*, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable.[10] The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari, Durga, Chandi, Chamunda, Mahakali, and Kali are commonly found.[11][12][13] While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.[14] The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.[15][16]\n\n\nIncarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to *avatar* are also found in Buddhism,[17] Christianity,[5] and other religions.[17]\n\n\nThe scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev, that formless eternal god is within the human heart, and man is his own savior.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and meaning[edit]\n\n\nThe Sanskrit noun (**avatāra**, Hindustani: [əʋˈtaːr]) is derived from the Sanskrit prefix *ava-* (down) and the root **tṛ** (to cross over).[20] These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to *-taritum*, *-tarati*, *-rītum*.[3]\n\n\n*Avatar* means \"descent, alight, to make one's appearance\",[3] and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.[20] The word also implies \"to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something\".[3] In Hindu traditions, the \"crossing or coming down\" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from \"eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude\".[5] An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a *saguna* (with form, attributes) embodiment of the *nirguna* Brahman or Atman (soul).[21] Avatar, according to \nBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati actually means 'Divine Descent' in his commentaries of The Shrimad Bhagavatam and The Bramha Samhita (mentioned in Brahmavaivarta Purana).\n\n\nNeither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mention the word *avatar* as a noun.[5] The verb roots and form, such as *avatarana*, appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as \"action of descending\", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).[22] The related verb *avatarana* is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as \"laying down the burden of man\" suffering from the forces of evil.[22]\n\n\nThe term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu.[1][3] The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to establish Dharma on Earth, uses other terms such as the word *sambhavāmi* in verse 4.6 and the word *tanu* in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita,[4] as well as other words such as *akriti* and *rupa* elsewhere.[23] It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.[6] The idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as *ansha-avatar* or partial embodiments.[4][1]\n\n\nThe term *avatar*, in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.[20] In some contexts, the term *avatara* just means a \"landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage\", or just \"achieve one's goals after effort\", or retranslation of a text in another language.[3] The term *avatar* is not unique to Hinduism even though the term originated with Hinduism. It is found in the *Trikaya* doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.[17]\n\n\n\n### Avatar versus incarnation[edit]\n\n\nThe manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an incarnation.[24] The translation of avatar as \"incarnation\" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.[25][26] The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. The term avatar in Hinduism refers to act of various gods taking form to perform a particular task which in most of the times is bringing dharma back. The concept of avatar is widely accepted all over the India.[27] Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.[28][note 1] Avatars are embodiments of spiritual perfection, driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism.[28] The concept of the avatar in Hinduism is not incompatible with natural conception through a sexual act, which is again different from the Christian concept of the Virgin Birth.\n\n\n\n### As a loanword[edit]\n\n\nFollowing 19th Century Western interest in Indian culture and Hinduism, the word \"Avatar\" was taken as loanword into English and other Western languages, where it is used in various contexts and meanings, often considerably different from its original meaning in Hinduism - see Avatar (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Vishnu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vishnu\n\nThe concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as \"Hindu\", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold.[30] An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:[9][26]\n\n\n\n\n> Arjuna, whenever righteousness is on the decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.  \n> \n> For the protection of the virtuous, for the extirpation of evil-doers, & for establishing Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I manifest Myself from age to age.\n> — Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8\n> \n\n\nThe Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.[31] The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.[31]\n\n\nThe most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.[26] The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.[32]\n\n\n\n### Dashavatara[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dashavatara\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations, the Dashavatara, are celebrated therein as his major appearances.[10][26] The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.[33][34]\n\n\nThe ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the *Dashavatara* (a Sanskrit compound meaning \"ten avatars\"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avatars of Vishnu\n| Name\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Matsya | The fish avatar. He saves Manu and the seven sages from the cosmic flood, and in some traditions, saves the Vedas from an asura called Hayagriva.[36] |\n| Kurma[note 2] | The tortoise/turtle avatar. He supports the mountain named Mandara while the devas and the asuras churn the ocean of milk to produce the nectar of immortality.[38] |\n| Varaha | The boar avatar. He rescues Bhumi, the goddess of the earth, when the asura Hiranyaksha abducts her, restoring her rightful place in the universe.[39] |\n| Narasimha | The lion avatar. He saves his devotee Prahlada and frees the three worlds from the tyranny of an asura named Hiranyakashipu.[40] |\n| Vamana | The dwarf avatar. He vanquishes the asura king Mahabali to the netherworld after taking three strides upon the universe, restoring the rule of Indra.[41] |\n| Parashurama | The warrior-sage avatar. He destroys the oppressive kings of the military class and creates a new social order.[42] |\n| Rama | The prince avatar. He rescues his wife Sita when she is abducted by the rakshasa king Ravana, restoring just rule to the world.[43] |\n| Balarama (debated)\n | The elder brother of Krishna and the god of agriculture. He is variously described as an avatar of Shesha, the serpent-mount of Vishnu, and an avatar of Vishnu.[44] |\n| Krishna | The eighth avatar of Vishnu who incarnates to re-establish righteousness in the world. He slays Kamsa, the tyrant of Mathura and his uncle, and participates in the Kurukshetra War as the charioteer of Arjuna.[45] |\n| Buddha (debated)\n | The historical Buddha, who incarnates to delude the asuras from the path of the Vedas, ensuring the victory of the devas. In some traditions, he is referred to as an avatar of Vishnu.[46] |\n| Kalki | The prophesied tenth avatar of Vishnu. He incarnates to bring an end to the present age of corruption called the Kali Yuga, re-establishing the four classes and law to the world.[47] |\n\n\n### Longer alternatives[edit]\n\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana also goes on to give an alternate list, wherein it numerically lists out 23 Vishnu avatars in chapter 1.3.[48]\n\n\n\n1.

One approach was to identify full avatars and partial avatars. Krishna, Rama, and Narasimha were full avatars (*purna avatars*), while others were partial avatars (*ansha avatars*).[29] Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an *avatar* of Vishnu.[29] The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatars include those that are direct and complete (*sakshad*), indirect and endowed (*avesha*), cosmic and salvific (*vyuha*), inner and inspirational (*antaryamin*), consecrated and in the form of image (*archa*).[29]\n\n\nYet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around *Guna-avatars*, *Purusha-avatars* and *Lila-avatars*, with their subtypes.[53][54] The *Guna-avatar* classification of *avatars* is based on the Guṇas concept of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, that is Rajas (Brahma), Sattva (Vishnu), and Tamas (Shiva).[53][54] These personalities of the Trimurti are referred to as *Guna avatars*.[53] The *Purushavatara* are three. The first evolves all matter (Prakriti), the second is the soul present in each individual creature, the third is the interconnected oneness or Brahman that connects all souls.[53][55] The *Lilavataras* are partial or full manifestations of Vishnu, where either some powers (Shakti) or material parts of him exist.[53][54]\n\n\nVishnu is Purushavatara.[56][57] The Matsya, Kurma, and Vamana avatars of Vishnu are Lilavataras.[54][56] A *Purnarupa* in this classification, is when Vishnu manifests completely along with his qualities and powers. In Bengal Vaishnavism, Krishna is the *Purnarupa*.[53] In Shaivism, Bhairava is the purnarupa of Shiva.[58]\n\n\n\n### In Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak's composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhism written by Guru Gobind Singh:[59]\n\n\n\n1. Mach (Matsya)\n2. Kach (Kurma)\n3. Nara (Nara in Nara-Narayana)\n4. Narayan (Narayana in Nara-Narayana)\n5. Maha Mohini (Mohini)\n6. Bairaha (Varaha)\n7. Nar Singha (Narasimha)\n8. Baman (Vamana)\n9. Parshuram (Parashurama)\n10. Bramma (Brahma)\n11. Balram (Balarama)\n12. Jalandhar (Jalandhara)\n13. Bishan (Vishnu)\n14. Sheshayi (Shesha)\n15. Arihant Dev (Arihanta)\n16. Manu Raja (Manu)\n17. Dhanvantari (Dhanvantari)\n18. Suraj (Surya)\n19. Chandar (Chandra)\n20. Ram (Rama)\n21. Kishan (Krishna)\n22. Nar (Arjuna)\n23. Rudra (Shiv)\n24. Kalki (Kalki)\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu deities, including Vishnu avatars such as Krishna, Hari, and Rama, as well those of Devi as Durga.[60][61][62]\n\n\nDasam Granth has three major compositions, one each dedicated to avatars of Vishnu (Chaubis avatar) and Brahma.[59][63] However, Sikhism rejects the doctrine of savior incarnation, and only accepts the abstract *nirguna* formless god.[18][64] The Sikh Gurus endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev (≈1270 – 1350 CE) that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.[18][65]\n\n\n\n### In Isma'ilism[edit]\n\n\nThe Gupti Ismailis, who observe pious circumspection as Hindus, uphold that the first Shi‘i Imam, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, as well as his descendants through the line of Isma‘il, are collectively Kalki, the tenth and final *avatāra* of Vishnu. According to this interpretation, these figures represent the continuity of divine guidance to humankind. In the view of some Guptis, this is corroborated by the Quranic verse 14:4 which mentions the idea that God had sent a messenger to every land. They understand the *avatāras* to be these messengers sent by God to their people in the Indian subcontinent.[66]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Shiva[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sharabha (right) with Narasimha (18th-century painting, Pahari/Kangra School)\nAlthough Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in Shaivism.[67] The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release.[15][16][68] Shaivism is a transcendental theology, where man, with the help of his Guru, is his own savior.[68]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana lists twenty-eight avatars of Shiva.[69] In the Shiva Purana there is a distinctly Saivite version of a traditional avatar myth: Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu. When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha which calms down lion-man Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra (not to be confused with Sudarshan Chakra) as gift. A similar story is told in the late medieval era Sharabha Upanishad.[70] However, Vaishnava Dvaita school refutes this Shaivite view of Narasimha.[71] According to the Shiva Purana, Lord Shiva has 19 avatars. According to the Kurma Purana, he has 28.\n\n\nThe vanara god Hanuman who helped Rama (the Vishnu avatar) is considered by some to be the eleventh avatar of Rudra (Shiva).[72][73] Some regional deities like Khandoba are also believed by some to be avatars of Shiva.[74][75]\nAshwatthama, the son of Drona is also considered to be an Avatar of Lord Shiva.\n\n\nShesha and his avatars (Balarama and Lakshmana) are occasionally linked to Shiva.[76][77][78][79] Adi Shankara, the formulator of Advaita Vedanta, is also occasionally regarded as an avatar of Shiva.[80]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[81]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Devis[edit]\n\n\n![An 18th century painting of the goddess Durga fighting Mahishasura](image)\n![A ca. 1910 chromolithograph of Kali trampling Shiva by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![An early 20th century chromolithograph of Sita in exile by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![The Hindu deity Parvati, 1050-1100 AD India](image)\nAvatars of Devi. Clockwise from upper left: Durga, Kali, Parvati and Sita.\n\nAvatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous as – much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.[82]\n\n\nNilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana – which includes the Devi Gita – says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama – generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars.[83] Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.[84]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Parvati[edit]\n\n\nDevi is popular in her form as Parvati. In Devi Mahatmya she is seen as the Goddess Mahakali, and in Uma Samhita, she is seen as Devi herself. Regarding her incarnations, it varies per sect in Hinduism. She could be all Goddesses as said in Shaivism and some main Shatism interpretations like the Sri kula and Kali Kula families, or just a form of Devi in some other Shaktism interpretations and many Vaishnava interpretations. With this in mind, Parvati's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahakali\n* Sati\n* Mahavidyas- Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi\n* The 64 Shakti Peethas\n* Navadurgas - Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri\n* Annapurna\n* Kaushiki\n* Durga\n* Shitala\n* Maheshwari\n* Ardhanarishvara\n* Vindhyavasini\n* Bhramari\n* Shakambhari\n* Raktadantika\n* Twarita\n* In North India- Khodiyar, Bahuchara Mata, Naina Devi, Jwala etc.\n* In Western India- Bhavani, Saptashrungi, Ekvira, Amba etc.\n* In East India-Dakshina Kali, Kamakhya, Jagadhatri etc.\n* In South India- Meenakshi, Vishalakshi, Kamakshi, Abhirami, Mookambika, Akilandeswari, Mariamman, Karumariamman etc.\n\n\nAll of these incarnations helped provide security to the world and even brought Shiva into the participation of worldly affairs.[85]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Lakshmi[edit]\n\n\nLike Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as in many forms to help provide order and to enlighten the world with her consort. She has many forms, and just like Parvati, some of her forms are not consistent throughout all sects and interpretations of Hinduism. In Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, Lakshmi is seen as Devi herself. She could be every Goddess as said in Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, or just another form of Devi as seen in other interpretations of Shaktism and in Shaivism. With this in mind, Lakshmi's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahalakshmi\n* At 108 Divya Desam\n* Ashtalakshmi - Adi Lakshmi, Dhanya Lakshmi, Dhana Lakshmi, Gaja Lakshmi, Santana Lakshmi, Vidya Lakshmi, Veera Lakshmi, Vijaya Lakshmi\n* With avatars of Vishnu - Sita, Radha, Gopi, Rukmini, Ashtabharya, Junior wives of Krishna, Padmavathi, Lakshmi Narayana, Andal, Dharini\n* Singular forms - Vedavati, Chottanikkara Bhagavathy, Mookambika devi, Vaishno Devi, As Kolhapur ambabai\n* Matrikas - Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasimhi\n* Wives of Vishnu - Sri, Bhumi, Nila\n* Mahavidya Kamalatmika\n\n\n## Avatars of Brahma[edit]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, second scriptures of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh, mentioned seven Brahma Avatars.[86]\n\n\n\n1. Valmiki\n2. Kashyapa\n3. Shukra\n4. Baches\n5. Vyasa\n6. Khat\n7. Kalidasa\n\n\nKhat avatar in this list refers to six different scholars who are considered to be founders of six schools of Indian philosophy.[87] According to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva.[88]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Ganesha[edit]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.[89] The two Upapuranas – Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana – detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect – exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.\n\n\nFour avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, Mayūreśvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose – to slay demons.[90]\n\n\nThe Mudgala Puranam describes eight avatars of Ganesha:[91]\n\n\n\n1. Vakratunda (*Vakratuṇḍa*) (\"twisting trunk\"), his mount is a lion.\n2. Ekadanta (\"single tusk\"), his mount is a mouse.\n3. Mahodara (\"big belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n4. Gajavaktra (or Gajānana) (\"elephant face\"), his mount is a mouse.\n5. Lambodara (\"pendulous belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n6. Vikata (*Vikaṭa*) (\"unusual form\", \"misshapen\"), his mount is a peacock.\n7. Vighnaraja (*Vighnarāja*) (\"king of obstacles\"), his mount is the celestial serpent *Śeṣa*.\n8. Dhumravarna (*Dhūmravarṇa*) (\"grey color\") corresponds to Śiva, his mount is a horse.\n\n\n## Avatars of Varuna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jhulelal, incarnation of Varuna\nJhulelal, the Iṣṭa-devatā (most-revered deity) of Sindhi Hindus, is considered the incarnation of Varuna.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Hinduism portal\n* ![](image)Philosophy portal\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* Abatur\n* Avatars in the Mahabharata\n* Dashavatara\n* Gautama Buddha in Hinduism\n* Incarnation\n* List of avatar claimants\n* Hindu eschatology\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.[29]\n2. **^** Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, appears in stories about the Kurma avatar.[37]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** James Lochtefeld (2002), \"Avatar\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, ISBN 0-8239-2287-1, pages 72–73\n2. **^** Geoffrey Parrinder (1997). *Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions*.

At the end of the meditation a drop of perspiration was produced from his forehead. That drop, of the shape of a bubble, in a moment fell on the earth. O you of an excellent face, I, having three eyes, a trident, and adorned with the crown of the matted hair, was born from that bubble. With modesty I asked the lord of gods: \"What shall I do?\" Then God Visnu, with delight, thus spoke to me: \"O Rudra, you will bring about a fierce-looking destruction of the world, (after) actually being (my) portion, viz. Samkarsana, O you of an excellent face.\"\n78. **^** Mahalik, Er. Nirakar (2010). \"Lord Balarama\" (PDF). *Orissa Review*. So Balarama became (Bala+Deva) Baladeva.

It signifies the material appearance or incarnation of a powerful deity, or spirit on Earth.[1][2] The relative verb to \"alight, to make one's appearance\" is sometimes used to refer to any guru or revered human being.[3][4]\n\n\nThe word *avatar* does not appear in the Vedic literature;[5] however, it appears in developed forms in post-Vedic literature, and as a noun particularly in the Puranic literature after the 6th century CE.[6] Despite that, the concept of an avatar is compatible with the content of the Vedic literature like the Upanishads as it is symbolic imagery of the Saguna Brahman concept in the philosophy of Hinduism. The *Rigveda* describes Indra as endowed with a mysterious power of assuming any form at will.[7][8] The *Bhagavad Gita* expounds the doctrine of Avatara but with terms other than *avatar*.[6][4]\n\n\nTheologically, the term is most often associated with the Hindu god Vishnu, though the idea has been applied to other deities.[9] Varying lists of avatars of Vishnu appear in Hindu scriptures, including the ten Dashavatara of the *Garuda Purana* and the twenty-two avatars in the *Bhagavata Purana*, though the latter adds that the incarnations of Vishnu are innumerable.[10] The avatars of Vishnu are important in Vaishnavism theology. In the goddess-based Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, avatars of the Devi in different appearances such as Tripura Sundari, Durga, Chandi, Chamunda, Mahakali, and Kali are commonly found.[11][12][13] While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional.[14] The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.[15][16]\n\n\nIncarnation concepts that are in some aspects similar to *avatar* are also found in Buddhism,[17] Christianity,[5] and other religions.[17]\n\n\nThe scriptures of Sikhism include the names of numerous Hindu gods and goddesses, but it rejected the doctrine of savior incarnation and endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev, that formless eternal god is within the human heart, and man is his own savior.[18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and meaning[edit]\n\n\nThe Sanskrit noun (**avatāra**, Hindustani: [əʋˈtaːr]) is derived from the Sanskrit prefix *ava-* (down) and the root **tṛ** (to cross over).[20] These roots trace back, states Monier-Williams, to *-taritum*, *-tarati*, *-rītum*.[3]\n\n\n*Avatar* means \"descent, alight, to make one's appearance\",[3] and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form.[20] The word also implies \"to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something\".[3] In Hindu traditions, the \"crossing or coming down\" is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from \"eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude\".[5] An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a *saguna* (with form, attributes) embodiment of the *nirguna* Brahman or Atman (soul).[21] Avatar, according to \nBhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati actually means 'Divine Descent' in his commentaries of The Shrimad Bhagavatam and The Bramha Samhita (mentioned in Brahmavaivarta Purana).\n\n\nNeither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mention the word *avatar* as a noun.[5] The verb roots and form, such as *avatarana*, appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as \"action of descending\", but not as an incarnated person (avatara).[22] The related verb *avatarana* is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as \"laying down the burden of man\" suffering from the forces of evil.[22]\n\n\nThe term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu.[1][3] The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to establish Dharma on Earth, uses other terms such as the word *sambhavāmi* in verse 4.6 and the word *tanu* in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita,[4] as well as other words such as *akriti* and *rupa* elsewhere.[23] It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity.[6] The idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as *ansha-avatar* or partial embodiments.[4][1]\n\n\nThe term *avatar*, in colloquial use, is also an epithet or a word of reverence for any extraordinary human being who is revered for his or her ideas.[20] In some contexts, the term *avatara* just means a \"landing place, site of sacred pilgrimage\", or just \"achieve one's goals after effort\", or retranslation of a text in another language.[3] The term *avatar* is not unique to Hinduism even though the term originated with Hinduism. It is found in the *Trikaya* doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism, in descriptions for the Dalai Lama in Tibetan Buddhism, and many ancient cultures.[17]\n\n\n\n### Avatar versus incarnation[edit]\n\n\nThe manifest embodiment is sometimes referred to as an incarnation.[24] The translation of avatar as \"incarnation\" has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect.[25][26] The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. The term avatar in Hinduism refers to act of various gods taking form to perform a particular task which in most of the times is bringing dharma back. The concept of avatar is widely accepted all over the India.[27] Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar.[28][note 1] Avatars are embodiments of spiritual perfection, driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism.[28] The concept of the avatar in Hinduism is not incompatible with natural conception through a sexual act, which is again different from the Christian concept of the Virgin Birth.\n\n\n\n### As a loanword[edit]\n\n\nFollowing 19th Century Western interest in Indian culture and Hinduism, the word \"Avatar\" was taken as loanword into English and other Western languages, where it is used in various contexts and meanings, often considerably different from its original meaning in Hinduism - see Avatar (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Vishnu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vishnu\n\nThe concept of avatar within Hinduism is most often associated with Vishnu, the preserver or sustainer aspect of God within the Hindu Trinity or Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Vishnu's avatars descend to empower the good and fight evil, thereby restoring Dharma. Traditional Hindus see themselves not as \"Hindu\", but as Vaishnava (Worshippers of Vishnu), Shaiva (Worshippers of Shiva), or Shakta (Worshipper of the Shakti). Each of the deities has its own iconography and mythology, but common to all is the fact that the divine reality has an explicit form, a form that the worshipper can behold.[30] An oft-quoted passage from the Bhagavad Gita describes the typical role of an avatar of Vishnu:[9][26]\n\n\n\n\n> Arjuna, whenever righteousness is on the decline, unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then I body Myself forth.  \n> \n> For the protection of the virtuous, for the extirpation of evil-doers, & for establishing Dharma (righteousness) on a firm footing, I manifest Myself from age to age.\n> — Bhagavad Gita 4.7–8\n> \n\n\nThe Vishnu avatars appear in Hindu mythology whenever the cosmos is in crisis, typically because evil has grown stronger and has thrown the cosmos out of its balance.[31] The avatar then appears in a material form, to destroy evil and its sources, and restore the cosmic balance between the ever-present forces of good and evil.[31]\n\n\nThe most known and celebrated avatars of Vishnu, within the Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism, are Krishna, Rama, Narayana and Vasudeva. These names have extensive literature associated with them, each has its own characteristics, legends and associated arts.[26] The Mahabharata, for example, includes Krishna, while the Ramayana includes Rama.[32]\n\n\n\n### Dashavatara[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dashavatara\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes Vishnu's avatars as innumerable, though ten of his incarnations, the Dashavatara, are celebrated therein as his major appearances.[10][26] The ten major Vishnu avatars are mentioned in the Agni Purana, the Garuda Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.[33][34]\n\n\nThe ten best known avatars of Vishnu are collectively known as the *Dashavatara* (a Sanskrit compound meaning \"ten avatars\"). Five different lists are included in the Bhagavata Purana, where the difference is in the sequence of the names. Freda Matchett states that this re-sequencing by the composers may be intentional, so as to avoid implying priority or placing something definitive and limited to the abstract.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Avatars of Vishnu\n| Name\n | Description\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Matsya | The fish avatar. He saves Manu and the seven sages from the cosmic flood, and in some traditions, saves the Vedas from an asura called Hayagriva.[36] |\n| Kurma[note 2] | The tortoise/turtle avatar. He supports the mountain named Mandara while the devas and the asuras churn the ocean of milk to produce the nectar of immortality.[38] |\n| Varaha | The boar avatar. He rescues Bhumi, the goddess of the earth, when the asura Hiranyaksha abducts her, restoring her rightful place in the universe.[39] |\n| Narasimha | The lion avatar. He saves his devotee Prahlada and frees the three worlds from the tyranny of an asura named Hiranyakashipu.[40] |\n| Vamana | The dwarf avatar. He vanquishes the asura king Mahabali to the netherworld after taking three strides upon the universe, restoring the rule of Indra.[41] |\n| Parashurama | The warrior-sage avatar. He destroys the oppressive kings of the military class and creates a new social order.[42] |\n| Rama | The prince avatar. He rescues his wife Sita when she is abducted by the rakshasa king Ravana, restoring just rule to the world.[43] |\n| Balarama (debated)\n | The elder brother of Krishna and the god of agriculture. He is variously described as an avatar of Shesha, the serpent-mount of Vishnu, and an avatar of Vishnu.[44] |\n| Krishna | The eighth avatar of Vishnu who incarnates to re-establish righteousness in the world. He slays Kamsa, the tyrant of Mathura and his uncle, and participates in the Kurukshetra War as the charioteer of Arjuna.[45] |\n| Buddha (debated)\n | The historical Buddha, who incarnates to delude the asuras from the path of the Vedas, ensuring the victory of the devas. In some traditions, he is referred to as an avatar of Vishnu.[46] |\n| Kalki | The prophesied tenth avatar of Vishnu. He incarnates to bring an end to the present age of corruption called the Kali Yuga, re-establishing the four classes and law to the world.[47] |\n\n\n### Longer alternatives[edit]\n\n\nThe Bhagavata Purana also goes on to give an alternate list, wherein it numerically lists out 23 Vishnu avatars in chapter 1.3.[48]\n\n\n\n1.

One approach was to identify full avatars and partial avatars. Krishna, Rama, and Narasimha were full avatars (*purna avatars*), while others were partial avatars (*ansha avatars*).[29] Some declared, states Noel Sheth, that every living creature is an *avatar* of Vishnu.[29] The Pancharatra text of Vaishnavism declares that Vishnu's avatars include those that are direct and complete (*sakshad*), indirect and endowed (*avesha*), cosmic and salvific (*vyuha*), inner and inspirational (*antaryamin*), consecrated and in the form of image (*archa*).[29]\n\n\nYet another classification, developed in Krishna schools, centers around *Guna-avatars*, *Purusha-avatars* and *Lila-avatars*, with their subtypes.[53][54] The *Guna-avatar* classification of *avatars* is based on the Guṇas concept of the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, that is Rajas (Brahma), Sattva (Vishnu), and Tamas (Shiva).[53][54] These personalities of the Trimurti are referred to as *Guna avatars*.[53] The *Purushavatara* are three. The first evolves all matter (Prakriti), the second is the soul present in each individual creature, the third is the interconnected oneness or Brahman that connects all souls.[53][55] The *Lilavataras* are partial or full manifestations of Vishnu, where either some powers (Shakti) or material parts of him exist.[53][54]\n\n\nVishnu is Purushavatara.[56][57] The Matsya, Kurma, and Vamana avatars of Vishnu are Lilavataras.[54][56] A *Purnarupa* in this classification, is when Vishnu manifests completely along with his qualities and powers. In Bengal Vaishnavism, Krishna is the *Purnarupa*.[53] In Shaivism, Bhairava is the purnarupa of Shiva.[58]\n\n\n\n### In Sikhism[edit]\n\n\n24 avatars of Vishnu are mentioned in Bachitar Natak's composition in Dasam Granth, the second scripture of Sikhism written by Guru Gobind Singh:[59]\n\n\n\n1. Mach (Matsya)\n2. Kach (Kurma)\n3. Nara (Nara in Nara-Narayana)\n4. Narayan (Narayana in Nara-Narayana)\n5. Maha Mohini (Mohini)\n6. Bairaha (Varaha)\n7. Nar Singha (Narasimha)\n8. Baman (Vamana)\n9. Parshuram (Parashurama)\n10. Bramma (Brahma)\n11. Balram (Balarama)\n12. Jalandhar (Jalandhara)\n13. Bishan (Vishnu)\n14. Sheshayi (Shesha)\n15. Arihant Dev (Arihanta)\n16. Manu Raja (Manu)\n17. Dhanvantari (Dhanvantari)\n18. Suraj (Surya)\n19. Chandar (Chandra)\n20. Ram (Rama)\n21. Kishan (Krishna)\n22. Nar (Arjuna)\n23. Rudra (Shiv)\n24. Kalki (Kalki)\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib reverentially includes the names of numerous Hindu deities, including Vishnu avatars such as Krishna, Hari, and Rama, as well those of Devi as Durga.[60][61][62]\n\n\nDasam Granth has three major compositions, one each dedicated to avatars of Vishnu (Chaubis avatar) and Brahma.[59][63] However, Sikhism rejects the doctrine of savior incarnation, and only accepts the abstract *nirguna* formless god.[18][64] The Sikh Gurus endorsed the view of Hindu Bhakti movement saints such as Namdev (≈1270 – 1350 CE) that formless eternal god is within the human heart and man is his own savior.[18][65]\n\n\n\n### In Isma'ilism[edit]\n\n\nThe Gupti Ismailis, who observe pious circumspection as Hindus, uphold that the first Shi‘i Imam, ‘Ali b. Abi Talib, as well as his descendants through the line of Isma‘il, are collectively Kalki, the tenth and final *avatāra* of Vishnu. According to this interpretation, these figures represent the continuity of divine guidance to humankind. In the view of some Guptis, this is corroborated by the Quranic verse 14:4 which mentions the idea that God had sent a messenger to every land. They understand the *avatāras* to be these messengers sent by God to their people in the Indian subcontinent.[66]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Shiva[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sharabha (right) with Narasimha (18th-century painting, Pahari/Kangra School)\nAlthough Puranic scriptures contain occasional references to avatars of Shiva, the avatar doctrine is neither universally accepted nor commonly adopted in Shaivism.[67] The views on the doctrine of incarnation has been one of the significant doctrinal differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism, in addition to their differences on the role of householder life versus monastic life for spiritual release.[15][16][68] Shaivism is a transcendental theology, where man, with the help of his Guru, is his own savior.[68]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana lists twenty-eight avatars of Shiva.[69] In the Shiva Purana there is a distinctly Saivite version of a traditional avatar myth: Shiva brings forth Virabhadra, one of his terrifying forms, in order to calm Narasimha, an avatar of Vishnu. When that fails, Shiva manifests as the human-lion-bird Sharabha which calms down lion-man Narasimha avatar of Vishnu, and Shiva then gives Vishnu a chakra (not to be confused with Sudarshan Chakra) as gift. A similar story is told in the late medieval era Sharabha Upanishad.[70] However, Vaishnava Dvaita school refutes this Shaivite view of Narasimha.[71] According to the Shiva Purana, Lord Shiva has 19 avatars. According to the Kurma Purana, he has 28.\n\n\nThe vanara god Hanuman who helped Rama (the Vishnu avatar) is considered by some to be the eleventh avatar of Rudra (Shiva).[72][73] Some regional deities like Khandoba are also believed by some to be avatars of Shiva.[74][75]\nAshwatthama, the son of Drona is also considered to be an Avatar of Lord Shiva.\n\n\nShesha and his avatars (Balarama and Lakshmana) are occasionally linked to Shiva.[76][77][78][79] Adi Shankara, the formulator of Advaita Vedanta, is also occasionally regarded as an avatar of Shiva.[80]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh mentioned two avatars of Rudra: Dattatreya Avatar and Parasnath Avatar.[81]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Devis[edit]\n\n\n![An 18th century painting of the goddess Durga fighting Mahishasura](image)\n![A ca. 1910 chromolithograph of Kali trampling Shiva by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![An early 20th century chromolithograph of Sita in exile by Raja Ravi Varma](image)\n![The Hindu deity Parvati, 1050-1100 AD India](image)\nAvatars of Devi. Clockwise from upper left: Durga, Kali, Parvati and Sita.\n\nAvatars are also observed in Shaktism, the sect dedicated to the worship of the Goddess (Devi), but they do not have universal acceptance in the sect. The Devi Bhagavata Purana describes the descent of Devi avatars to punish the wicked and defend the righteous as – much as the Bhagavata Purana does with the avatars of Vishnu.[82]\n\n\nNilakantha, an 18th-century commentator on the Devi Bhagavata Purana – which includes the Devi Gita – says that various avatars of the Goddess includes Shakambhari and even the masculine Krishna and Rama – generally thought to be Vishnu's avatars.[83] Parvati, Lakshmi and Saraswati are main goddesses worshipped as Devi avatars.[84]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Parvati[edit]\n\n\nDevi is popular in her form as Parvati. In Devi Mahatmya she is seen as the Goddess Mahakali, and in Uma Samhita, she is seen as Devi herself. Regarding her incarnations, it varies per sect in Hinduism. She could be all Goddesses as said in Shaivism and some main Shatism interpretations like the Sri kula and Kali Kula families, or just a form of Devi in some other Shaktism interpretations and many Vaishnava interpretations. With this in mind, Parvati's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahakali\n* Sati\n* Mahavidyas- Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi\n* The 64 Shakti Peethas\n* Navadurgas - Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri\n* Annapurna\n* Kaushiki\n* Durga\n* Shitala\n* Maheshwari\n* Ardhanarishvara\n* Vindhyavasini\n* Bhramari\n* Shakambhari\n* Raktadantika\n* Twarita\n* In North India- Khodiyar, Bahuchara Mata, Naina Devi, Jwala etc.\n* In Western India- Bhavani, Saptashrungi, Ekvira, Amba etc.\n* In East India-Dakshina Kali, Kamakhya, Jagadhatri etc.\n* In South India- Meenakshi, Vishalakshi, Kamakshi, Abhirami, Mookambika, Akilandeswari, Mariamman, Karumariamman etc.\n\n\nAll of these incarnations helped provide security to the world and even brought Shiva into the participation of worldly affairs.[85]\n\n\n\n### Avatars of Lakshmi[edit]\n\n\nLike Vishnu, his consort Lakshmi incarnates as in many forms to help provide order and to enlighten the world with her consort. She has many forms, and just like Parvati, some of her forms are not consistent throughout all sects and interpretations of Hinduism. In Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, Lakshmi is seen as Devi herself. She could be every Goddess as said in Vaishnavism and some interpretations of Shaktism, or just another form of Devi as seen in other interpretations of Shaktism and in Shaivism. With this in mind, Lakshmi's forms include:\n\n\n\n* Mahalakshmi\n* At 108 Divya Desam\n* Ashtalakshmi - Adi Lakshmi, Dhanya Lakshmi, Dhana Lakshmi, Gaja Lakshmi, Santana Lakshmi, Vidya Lakshmi, Veera Lakshmi, Vijaya Lakshmi\n* With avatars of Vishnu - Sita, Radha, Gopi, Rukmini, Ashtabharya, Junior wives of Krishna, Padmavathi, Lakshmi Narayana, Andal, Dharini\n* Singular forms - Vedavati, Chottanikkara Bhagavathy, Mookambika devi, Vaishno Devi, As Kolhapur ambabai\n* Matrikas - Vaishnavi, Varahi, Narasimhi\n* Wives of Vishnu - Sri, Bhumi, Nila\n* Mahavidya Kamalatmika\n\n\n## Avatars of Brahma[edit]\n\n\nIn Dasam Granth, second scriptures of Sikhs written by Guru Gobind Singh, mentioned seven Brahma Avatars.[86]\n\n\n\n1. Valmiki\n2. Kashyapa\n3. Shukra\n4. Baches\n5. Vyasa\n6. Khat\n7. Kalidasa\n\n\nKhat avatar in this list refers to six different scholars who are considered to be founders of six schools of Indian philosophy.[87] According to the Skanda Purana, Brahma incarnated himself as Yajnavalkya in response to a curse from Shiva.[88]\n\n\n\n## Avatars of Ganesha[edit]\n\n\nThe Linga Purana declares that Ganesha incarnates to destroy demons and to help the gods and pious people.[89] The two Upapuranas – Ganesha Purana and Mudgala Purana – detail the avatars of Ganesha. Both these upapuranas are core scriptures of the Ganapatya sect – exclusively dedicated to Ganesha worship.\n\n\nFour avatars of Ganesha are listed in the Ganesha Purana: Mohotkata, Mayūreśvara, Gajanana and Dhumraketu. Each avatar corresponds to a different yuga, has a different mount and different skin complexion, but all the avatars have a common purpose – to slay demons.[90]\n\n\nThe Mudgala Puranam describes eight avatars of Ganesha:[91]\n\n\n\n1. Vakratunda (*Vakratuṇḍa*) (\"twisting trunk\"), his mount is a lion.\n2. Ekadanta (\"single tusk\"), his mount is a mouse.\n3. Mahodara (\"big belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n4. Gajavaktra (or Gajānana) (\"elephant face\"), his mount is a mouse.\n5. Lambodara (\"pendulous belly\"), his mount is a mouse.\n6. Vikata (*Vikaṭa*) (\"unusual form\", \"misshapen\"), his mount is a peacock.\n7. Vighnaraja (*Vighnarāja*) (\"king of obstacles\"), his mount is the celestial serpent *Śeṣa*.\n8. Dhumravarna (*Dhūmravarṇa*) (\"grey color\") corresponds to Śiva, his mount is a horse.\n\n\n## Avatars of Varuna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jhulelal, incarnation of Varuna\nJhulelal, the Iṣṭa-devatā (most-revered deity) of Sindhi Hindus, is considered the incarnation of Varuna.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Hinduism portal\n* ![](image)Philosophy portal\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* Abatur\n* Avatars in the Mahabharata\n* Dashavatara\n* Gautama Buddha in Hinduism\n* Incarnation\n* List of avatar claimants\n* Hindu eschatology\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Buddha, a real person, is included as an avatar of Vishnu in many Hindu texts.[29]\n2. **^** Mohini, the female avatar of Vishnu, appears in stories about the Kurma avatar.[37]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** James Lochtefeld (2002), \"Avatar\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, ISBN 0-8239-2287-1, pages 72–73\n2. **^** Geoffrey Parrinder (1997). *Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions*.

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.\n\n\nRMS *Titanic* was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three *Olympic*-class ocean liners built for the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. *Titanic* was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nThe first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath, and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. *Titanic* had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as \"unsinkable\".\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. However, she actually carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking (Collapsible A nearly swamped and was filled with a foot of water until rescue; Collapsible B completely overturned while launching). Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people—about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nGaumont newsreel containing the only known footage of *Titanic*, 1912\nThe name *Titanic* derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS *Titanic* was the second of the three *Olympic*-class ocean liners—the lead vessel was RMS *Olympic* and the final ship in the class was HMHS *Britannic*.[5] They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.[6] The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).\n\n\nThe White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard—which had recently launched *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, the fastest passenger ships then in service—and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.[7] The White Star Line sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton–Cherbourg–New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, the *Olympic* and *Titanic* would replace RMS *Teutonic* of 1889, RMS *Majestic* of 1890 as well as RMS *Adriatic* of 1907. RMS *Oceanic* would remain on the route until the third new ship could be delivered.[*citation needed*] *Majestic* resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service post the loss of *Titanic*'.[8]\n\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[9] Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.[9] In the case of the *Olympic*-class ships, a cost of £3 million (approximately £310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.[10]\n\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing *Olympic*-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.[11] Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.[b]\n\n\nOn July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.[14] At this point, the first ship—which was later to become *Olympic*—had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. *Titanic* was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.[15]\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Starboard view of *Titanic*\n*Titanic* was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m).\n\n\nHer total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m).[16] She measured 46,329 GRT and 21,831 NRT[17] and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons.[5]\nAll three of the *Olympic*-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:\n\n\n\n* The **boat deck**, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that *Titanic*'s lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.[18][19]\n* **A Deck**, also called the **promenade deck**, extended along the entire 546 feet (166 m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms, and Palm Court.[18]\n* **B Deck**, the **bridge deck**, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On *Titanic*, the à la carte restaurant and the Café Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.[c] Aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck, 106 feet (32 m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of *Titanic*'s passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks.[20][21]\n* **C Deck**, the **shelter deck**, was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.[20][22]\n* **D Deck**, the **saloon deck**, was dominated by three large public rooms—the First Class reception room, the First Class dining saloon and the Second Class dining saloon. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second and Third Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).[20][23]\n* **E Deck**, the **upper deck**, was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and trimmers. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.[20][24]\n* **F Deck**, the **middle deck**, was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as were the swimming pool, Turkish bath and kennels.[20][24][25]\n* **G Deck**, the **lower deck**, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.[20][26]\n* The **orlop decks**, and the **tank top** below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.[20][26]\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)RMS *Olympic*'s rudder with central and port wing propellers;[27] the man at the bottom shows scale.[28]\n*Titanic* propulsion was supplied by three main engines—two reciprocating four-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engines and one centrally placed low-pressure Parsons turbine—each driving a propeller. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 horsepower (22,000 kW). The output of the steam turbine was 16,000 horsepower (12,000 kW).[16] The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, *Laurentic*, where it had been a great success.[29] It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an *Olympic*-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*.[30] By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.[31]\n\n\nThe two reciprocating engines were each 63 feet (19 m) long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.[30] They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and five single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.[32] The boilers were 15 feet 9 inches (4.80 m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1 m) long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.[33]\n\n\nThey were fuelled by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in *Titanic*'s bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock.[34] 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.[35] The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively well,[34] there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.[36]\n\n\nExhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a surface condenser, to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused.[37] The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of 23.5 feet (7.2 m).[33] The middle propeller was slightly smaller at 17 feet (5.2 m) in diameter,[38] and could be stopped but not reversed.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time.[39] Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400 kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30 kW auxiliary generators for emergency use.[40] Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.[41]\n\n\n*Titanic* lacked a searchlight in accordance with the ban on the use of searchlights in the merchant navy.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\n#### Compartments and funnels[edit]\n\n\nThe interiors of the *Olympic*-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary compartments divided by 15 bulkheads that extended above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an emergency.[44] The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation.[45] Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops; only three were functional—the aftmost one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and kitchen ventilation. Two masts, each 155 ft (47 m) high, supported derricks for working cargo.\n\n\n\n#### Rudder and steering engines[edit]\n\n\nDue to the size and weight of *Titanic*'s rudder—at 78 feet 8 inches (23.98 m) high and 15 feet 3 inches (4.65 m) long, weighing over 100 tons—that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed, though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.[46] As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans.[47] The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two kedging anchors).[47]\n\n\n\n#### Water, ventilation and heating[edit]\n\n\nThe ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while *Titanic* was in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Radio communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMarconi Company receiving equipment for a 5-kilowatt ocean liner station (in the picture, the wireless radio room of *Titanic*'s sister ship, *Olympic*)\n![](image)\nThe only known picture of *Titanic*'s wireless radio room, taken by the Catholic priest Francis Browne. Harold Bride is seated at the desk.\n\n*Titanic*'s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as wireless telegraphy) was leased to the White Star Line by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, which also supplied two of its employees, Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams (\"marconigrams\"), but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings.[48][49][50]\nThe radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed \"Silent Room\", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5-kilowatt rotary spark-gap transmitter, with the wireless telegraph call sign MGY, and communication was in Morse code. This transmitter was one of the first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark-gap, which gave *Titanic* a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of 350 miles (304 nmi; 563 km). An elevated T-antenna that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500 kHz (600 m wavelength); however, the equipment could also operate on the \"short\" wavelength of 1,000 kHz (300 m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.[51]\n\n\n\n### Passenger facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First-class facilities of the *Titanic* and Second- and third-class facilities on *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Grand Staircase of *Titanic*\n\nThe passenger facilities aboard *Titanic* aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to *Titanic*'s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a manor house or an English country house.[52]\n\n\n*Titanic* was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels—the Ritz Hotel was a reference point—with First Class cabins finished in the Empire style.[52] A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the Renaissance to Louis XV, were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would \"at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore\".[53]\n\n\nAmong the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a 7 ft (2.1 m) deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, and a Turkish bath which comprised electric bath, steam room, cool room, massage room, and hot room.[53] First-class common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a lounge in the style of the Palace of Versailles, an enormous reception room, a men's smoking room, and a reading and writing room. There was an à la carte restaurant in the style of the Ritz Hotel which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur Gaspare Gatti.[54] A *Café Parisien* decorated in the style of a French sidewalk café, complete with ivy-covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French *haute cuisine* in the most luxurious of surroundings.[55] There was also a *Verandah Café* where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At 114 ft (35 m) long by 92 ft (28 m) wide, the dining saloon on D Deck, designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll, was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.[56]\n\n\n\n* ![The Forward First Class Grand Staircase of Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.

They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities. \n\n\nThe White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard *Titanic*, all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and ten passengers.[57]\n\n\nThird Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard *Titanic* comprised the poop deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a general room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper-class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.\n\n\nLeisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.[58]\n\n\nOne of *Titanic*'s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the Grand Staircase or Grand Stairway. Built of solid English oak with a sweeping curve, the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship, between the boat deck to E deck, before terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.[59] It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls panelled in the William & Mary style and lit by ormolu and crystal light fixtures.[60]\n\n\nAt the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" flanking the clock face.[59] The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.[61] During the filming of James Cameron's *Titanic* in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.[62]\n\n\n\n### Mail and cargo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*La Circassienne au Bain* by Merry-Joseph Blondel; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on *Titanic*. This image is of a copy.[d]\nAlthough *Titanic* was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail (and also for the United States Post Office Department). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables), 26,800 cubic feet (760 m3) of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks (three Americans and two Britons), who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week, sorting up to 60,000 items daily.[64]\n\n\nThe ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another 19,455 cubic feet (550.9 m3) was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE Coupe de Ville motor car.[65] Despite later myths, the cargo on *Titanic*'s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the *Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam*, was valued at only £405 (£50,600 today).[66] According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled *La Circassienne au Bain* by French artist Merry-Joseph Blondel. The painting's owner, first-class passenger Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson, filed a claim for $100,000 (equivalent to $2,300,000 in 2023) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.[63]\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the holds. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.[67]\n\n\n\n### Lifeboats[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lifeboats of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)A collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides\nLike *Olympic*, *Titanic* carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Engelhardt \"collapsible\" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two emergency cutters with a capacity of 40 people each.[68][e] *Olympic* carried at least two collapsible boats on either side of her number one funnel.[69][70] All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and B, connected to davits by ropes. Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2–16 from bow to stern.[71]\n\n\nBoth cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number 1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand.[71] Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.\n\n\n*Titanic* had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats as Carlisle had planned. This gave *Titanic* the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats[72] which would have been enough for 4,000 people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-third of *Titanic*'s total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.[68]\n\n\nTherefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.[73][f] At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship—not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had SS *Californian* responded to *Titanic*'s distress calls, the lifeboats might have been able to ferry all passengers to safety as planned.[75]\n\n\n\n## Building and preparing the ship[edit]\n\n\n### Construction, launch and fitting-out[edit]\n\n\n![Construction in gantry, bow is seen](image)\nConstruction in gantry, 1909–11\n![Launch, 1911; ship with unfinished superstructure](image)\nLaunch, 1911 (unfinished superstructure)\n![Fitting-out, 1911–12: Ship is seen in dock](image)\nFitting-out, 1911–12\n\nThe sheer size of the *Olympic class* vessels posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.[76] The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the Titanic Quarter, in Belfast Harbour. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.[10] Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by Sir William Arrol & Co., a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the Forth Bridge and London's Tower Bridge. The Arrol Gantry stood 228 feet (69 m) high, was 270 feet (82 m) wide and 840 feet (260 m) long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.[77]\n\n\nThe construction of *Olympic* and *Titanic* took place virtually in parallel, with *Olympic*'s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and *Titanic*'s on 31 March 1909.[15] Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) deep supported 300 frames, each between 24 inches (61 cm) and 36 inches (91 cm) apart and measuring up to about 66 feet (20 m) long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.[78]\n\n\nThe 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of rolled steel plate, mostly up to 6 feet (1.8 m) wide and 30 feet (9.1 m) long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.[79] Their thickness varied from 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).[44] The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the \"in and out\" fashion, where strake plating was applied in bands (the \"in strakes\") with the gaps covered by the \"out strakes\", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc welding methods, ubiquitous in fabrication today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.[80] In the 1990s some material scientists concluded[81] that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the steel plate's quality was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking.[81] As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.[82][83][84][85][86]\n\n\nAmong the last items to be fitted on *Titanic* before the ship's launch were her two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a challenge to make, with the centre anchor being the largest ever forged by hand and weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty Clydesdale draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the Noah Hingley & Sons Ltd forge shop in Netherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles away. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before being loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.[87]\n\n\nThe work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,[88] safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was carried out without equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, during *Titanic*'s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them \"severe\", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.[89] Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.[90]\n\n\n*Titanic* was launched at 12:15 pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.[91][92] Twenty-two tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River Lagan.[90] In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.[91] The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.[93]\n\n\nAlthough *Titanic* was virtually identical to the class's lead ship *Olympic*, a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable exterior difference was that *Titanic* (and the third vessel in class, *Britannic*) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to First Class passengers.[94] Extensive changes were made to B Deck on *Titanic* as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on *Olympic*, was converted into additional First Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The *À la Carte* restaurant was also enlarged and the *Café Parisien*, an entirely new feature which did not exist on *Olympic*, was added. These changes made *Titanic* slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair *Olympic*, which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had *Titanic* been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.[90]\n\n\n\n### Sea trials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Titanic* departing Belfast for sea trials on 2 April 1912\n*Titanic*'s sea trials began at 6 am on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.[95] The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.[96] Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on *Titanic*'s sea trials: Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff, and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.[97]\n\n\nThe sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in Belfast Lough and then in the open waters of the Irish Sea. Over the course of about 12 hours, *Titanic* was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a \"crash stop\" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in 850 yd (777 m) or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.[98] The ship covered a distance of about 80 nautical miles (92 mi; 150 km), averaging 18 knots (21 mph; 33 km/h) and reaching a maximum speed of just under 21 knots (24 mph; 39 km/h).[99]\n\n\nOn returning to Belfast at about 7 pm, the surveyor signed an \"Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew\", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, *Titanic* departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a voyage of about 570 nautical miles (660 mi; 1,060 km). After a journey lasting about 28 hours, she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.[100]\n\n\n\n## Maiden voyage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Titanic* at Southampton docks, prior to departure\n![](image)\n*Titanic* in Cork harbour, 11 April 1912\n\nBoth *Olympic* and *Titanic* registered Liverpool as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line, as well as Cunard, were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the *Olympic*, most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, sailed from Liverpool followed by a port of call in Queenstown, Ireland. Since the company's founding in 1845, a vast majority of their operations had taken place from Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star Line established another service from Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's \"Express Service\". Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.[101]\n\n\nIn addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily cross the English Channel and make a port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at Cherbourg. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at Queenstown. The Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after World War I. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. *Queen Elizabeth 2* was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.[101]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic crossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on westbound runs, returning via Plymouth in England while eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists.[102] When the route was established, four ships were assigned to the service. In addition to *Teutonic* and *Majestic*, RMS *Oceanic* and the brand new RMS *Adriatic* sailed the route. When the *Olympic* entered service in June 1911, she replaced *Teutonic*, which after completing her last run on the service in late April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The following August, *Adriatic* was transferred to White Star Line's main Liverpool-New York service, and in November, *Majestic* was withdrawn from service impending the arrival of *Titanic* in the coming months, and was mothballed as a reserve ship.[103][104]\n\n\nWhite Star Line's initial plans for *Olympic* and *Titanic* on the Southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.[104] The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the \"*White Star Dock*\", had been specially constructed to accommodate the new *Olympic*-class liners, and had opened in 1911.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crew[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crew of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)Edward Smith, captain of *Titanic*, in 1911\n*Titanic* had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.[106] Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.[107] The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during *Titanic*'s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.[108]\n\n\nCaptain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from *Olympic* to take command of *Titanic*.[109] Henry Tingle Wilde also came across from *Olympic* to take the post of chief mate. *Titanic*'s previously designated chief mate and first officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of first and second officer respectively. The original second officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether.[110][g] The third officer was Herbert Pitman, the only deck officer who was not a member of the Royal Naval Reserve. Pitman was the second-to-last surviving officer.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494.[111] The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.[112] Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.[113] The rest represented a great variety of professions—bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,[113] who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the *Atlantic Daily Bulletin* with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.[48][h]\n\n\nMost of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;[15] in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.[113] A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class *À La Carte* Restaurant and the Café Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.[115] Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's £105 a month (equivalent to £13,100 today) to the £3 10*s* (£440 today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.[114]\n\n\n\n### Passengers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Animals aboard *Titanic*\n\n![](image)John Jacob Astor IV in 1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard *Titanic*; he did not survive.\n*Titanic*'s passengers numbered approximately 1,317 people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of whom were in Third Class.[116] The ship was considerably under-capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.[117]\n\n\nUsually, a high-prestige vessel like *Titanic* could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before *Titanic* sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. *Titanic* was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as SS *City of New York* and RMS *Oceanic*, as well as coal that *Olympic* had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.[94]\n\n\nSome of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard *Titanic*, travelling in First Class. Among them (with those who perished marked with a dagger†) were the American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV† and his wife, Madeleine Force Astor (with John Jacob Astor VI in utero); industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim†; painter and sculptor Francis Davis Millet†; Macy's owner Isidor Straus† and his wife, Ida†; Denver millionairess Margaret \"Molly\" Brown;[i] Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturière Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon); Lieut.

Morgan was scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage but cancelled at the last minute.[119] Also aboard the ship were the White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay and *Titanic*'s designer Thomas Andrews†, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.[120]\n\n\nThe exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,[121] and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.[122] Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost £7 5*s* (equivalent to £900 today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost £23 (£2,900 today).[104] The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to £870 in high season (£109,000 today).[117]\n\n\n\n### Collecting passengers[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew, the passengers began arriving at 9:30 am, when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, alongside *Titanic*'s berth.[123] The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.[124] Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States – a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.[121] In all, 920 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Southampton – 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.[94]\n\n\nThe maiden voyage began at noon, as scheduled. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later, as *Titanic* passed the moored liners SS *City of New York* of the American Line and *Oceanic* of the White Star Line, the latter of which would have been her running mate on the service from Southampton. Her huge displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and then dropped into a trough. *New York*'s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards *Titanic*. A nearby tugboat, *Vulcan*, came to the rescue by taking *New York* under tow, and Captain Smith ordered *Titanic*'s engines to be put \"full astern\".[125] The two ships avoided a collision by a distance of about 4 feet (1.2 m). The incident delayed *Titanic*'s departure for about an hour, while the drifting *New York* was brought under control.[126][127]\n\n\nAfter making it safely through the complex tides and channels of Southampton Water and the Solent, *Titanic* disembarked the Southampton pilot at the Nab Lightship and headed out into the English Channel.[128] She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of 77 nautical miles (89 mi; 143 km).[129] The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.[130] Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of *Titanic*, tenders had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, SS *Traffic* and SS *Nomadic*. Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the *Olympic*-class liners and were launched shortly after *Titanic*.[131] (*Nomadic* is the only surviving White Star Line ship) Four hours after *Titanic* left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. There, 274 additional passengers were taken aboard – 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore, having booked only a cross-Channel passage. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8 pm *Titanic* weighed anchor and left for Queenstown[132] with the weather continuing cold and windy.[130]\n\n\nAt 11:30 am on Thursday 11 April, *Titanic* arrived at Cork Harbour on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.[130] Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of *Titanic*'s size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Queenstown – three First Class, seven Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-Channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard *Titanic*, including one of the last known photographs of the ship. The very last one was taken by another cross-channel passenger Kate Odell.[133] A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore.[134] *Titanic* weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30 pm and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.[134]\n\n\n\n### Atlantic crossing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Titanic* itinerary on the Northern Atlantic, from Fastnet Light (Ireland) to Ambrose Light (New York)\n![](image)Ice warnings prior to the accident of 14 April\n*Titanic* was planned to arrive at New York Pier 59[135] on the morning of 17 April.[136] After leaving Queenstown, *Titanic* followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock,[137] a distance of some 55 nautical miles (63 mi; 102 km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860 mi; 3,000 km) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as \"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. *Titanic* sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177 mi; 1,895 km) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[138] The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222 mi; 357 km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.[139]\n\n\nFrom 11 April to local apparent noon the next day, *Titanic* covered 484 nautical miles (557 mi; 896 km); the following day, 519 nautical miles (597 mi; 961 km); and by noon on the final day of her voyage, 546 nautical miles (628 mi; 1,011 km). From then until the time of her sinking, she travelled another 258 nautical miles (297 mi; 478 km), averaging about 21 knots (24 mph; 39 km/h).[140]\n\n\nThe weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind. Temperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day *Titanic* crossed a cold weather front with strong winds and waves of up to 8 feet (2.4 m). These died down as the day progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm, and very cold.[141]\n\n\nThe first three days of the voyage from Queenstown had passed without apparent incident. A fire had begun in one of *Titanic*'s coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage,[142] but passengers were unaware of this situation. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships at the time, due to spontaneous combustion of the coal.[143] The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace.[144] The fire was finally extinguished on 14 April.[145][146] There has been some speculation and discussion as to whether this fire and attempts to extinguish it may have made the ship more vulnerable to sinking.[147][148]\n\n\n*Titanic* received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but Captain Smith ignored them.[149] One of the ships to warn *Titanic* was the Atlantic Line's *Mesaba*.[150] Nevertheless, *Titanic* continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.[151] Although she was not trying to set a speed record,[152] timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed; ice warnings were seen as advisories, and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.[151] It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, SS *Kronprinz Wilhelm*, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still completed her voyage, and Smith said in 1907 that he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"[153][j]\n\n\n\n### Sinking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sinking of *Titanic*\n\n![Drawing of sinking in four steps from eyewitness description](image)\nThe sinking, based on Jack Thayer's description. Sketched by L.P. Skidmore on board *Carpathia*.\n![Photo of an iceberg taken the day after the sinking at the place of sinking](image)\nThe iceberg thought to have been hit by *Titanic*, photographed on the morning of 15 April 1912. Note the dark spot just along the berg's waterline, which was described by onlookers as a smear of red paint.\n![\"Untergang der Titanic\", a painting showing a big ship sinking with survivors in the water and boats](image)\n\"Untergang *der Titanic*\", as conceived by Willy Stöwer, 1912\n\nAt 11:40 pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of *Titanic* and alerted the bridge.[156] First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the engines to be reversed,[157] but it was too late. The starboard side of *Titanic* struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.[k] The hull was not punctured, but rather dented such that its seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that *Titanic* would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.[159]\n\n\nThose aboard *Titanic* were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,[160][l] *Titanic* only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.[162] The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.[163] Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.[164] The \"women and children first\" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,[164] and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard. Women and children survived at rates of about 75 percent and 50 percent, while only 20 percent of men survived.[165]\n\n\nBetween 2:10 and 2:15 am, a little over two and a half hours after *Titanic* struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.[166] As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,[167] before foundering at 2:20 am.[168] It was believed that *Titanic* sank in one piece, but the discovery of the wreck many years later revealed that she had broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of −2 °C (28 °F). Only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats, though the lifeboats had room for almost 500 more people.[169]\n\n\nDistress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach *Titanic* before she sank.[170] A radio operator on board SS *Birma*, for instance, estimated that it would be 6 am before the liner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, SS *Californian*, which was the last to have been in contact before the collision, saw *Titanic*'s flares but failed to assist.[171] Around 4 am, RMS *Carpathia* arrived on the scene in response to *Titanic*'s earlier distress calls.[172]\n\n\nWhen the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.[173] 706 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by *Carpathia* to New York, *Titanic*'s original destination, while 1,517 people died.[106] *Carpathia*'s captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61 m) high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from *Titanic*; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.[174] This area is now known as Iceberg Alley.[175]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath of sinking[edit]\n\n\n### Immediate aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The New York Times* had gone to press 15 April with knowledge of the collision but not the sinking.[176]\n![](image)\nThe International Mercantile Marine Company's statement on Monday 15 April assured that despite the lack of communication from the ship, it was \"unsinkable\".[177]\n\n![](image)\nLondon newsboy Ned Parfett with news of the disaster, as reported on Tuesday, 16 April\n![](image)\n*Titanic* had been scheduled for a 20 April departure, seen in a *New York Times* ad apparently unable to be pulled, overnight, before this 15 April printing.[178]\n\nRMS *Carpathia* took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.[179] She was, however, able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confusing, leading the American press to report erroneously on 15 April that *Titanic* was being towed to port by SS *Virginian*.[180] Late on the night of 15 April White Star reported a message received saying *Titanic* had sunk, but all her passengers and crew had been transferred to another vessel.[181] Later that day, confirmation came through that *Titanic* had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died.[182] The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,[183] Southampton,[184] Liverpool and Belfast.[185] It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking;[186] four out of every five crew members came from this town.[187][m]\n*Carpathia* docked at 9:30 pm on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain.[190] Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations.[191] Many of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. *Titanic*'s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer SS *Lapland*, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.[192]\n\n\n*Carpathia* was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to Fiume, Austria-Hungary. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of *Titanic*'s passengers joined to give them an additional bonus of nearly £900 (£113,000 today), divided among the crew members.[193]\n\n\nThe ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat *New York*, which guided *Carpathia* into harbour, and one even managed to get onto *Carpathia* before she docked.[194] Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards.[195] It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard *Titanic*.[n]\n\n\n\n### Insurance, aid for survivors and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCartoon demanding better safety from shipping companies, 1912\n![](image)\nMolly Brown presenting award to *Carpathia* Captain Arthur Rostron for his service in the rescue\n\nIn January 1912, the hulls and equipment of *Titanic* and *Olympic* had been insured through Lloyd's of London and London Marine Insurance. The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£102,000,000 today) per ship. The policy was to be \"free from all average\" under £150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis Group), was 15 *s* (75 *p*) per £100, or £7,500 (£940,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.[197]\n\n\nMany charities were set up to help the survivors and their families, many of whom lost their sole wage earner, or, in the case of many Third Class survivors, everything they owned. In New York City, for example, a joint committee of the American Red Cross and Charity Organization Society formed to disburse financial aid to survivors and dependents of those who died.[198] On 29 April, opera stars Enrico Caruso and Mary Garden and members of the Metropolitan Opera raised $12,000 ($300,000 in 2014)[199] in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of \"Autumn\" and \"Nearer My God To Thee\" were part of the programme.[200] In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of *Titanic*'s lost crew members, raising nearly £450,000 (£56,000,000 today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.[201]\n\n\nIn the United States and Britain, more than 60 survivors combined to sue the White Star Line for damages connected to loss of life and baggage.[202] The claims totalled $16,804,112 (appr. $419 million in 2018 USD), which was far in excess of what White Star argued it was responsible for as a limited liability company under American law.[203] Because the bulk of the litigants were in the United States, White Star petitioned the United States Supreme Court in 1914, which ruled in its favour that it qualified as an LLC and found that the causes of the ship's sinking were largely unforeseeable, rather than due to negligence.[204] This sharply limited the scope of damages survivors and family members were entitled to, prompting them to reduce their claims to some $2.5 million. White Star only settled for $664,000 (appr. $16.56 million in 2018), about 27% of the original total sought by survivors. The settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.[202][203]\n\n\n\n### Investigations into the disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic* and British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)**Senate Inquiry**: within five days of the sinking, *The New York Times* published several columns relating to Ismay's conduct—concerning which \"there has been so much comment\".[205] Columns included the statement of attorney Karl H. Behr indicating Ismay had helped supervise loading of passengers in lifeboats, and of William E. Carter stating that he and Ismay boarded a lifeboat only after there were no more women.[205]\nEven before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-orientated.[206]\n\n\nThe US Senate's inquiry into the disaster was initiated on 19 April, a day after *Carpathia* arrived in New York.[207] The chairman, Senator William Alden Smith, wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May.[208] The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing \"his moment to stand on the world stage\". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on US railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, *Titanic*'s ultimate owner.[209]\n\n\nThe British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster was headed by Lord Mersey, and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some[*like whom?*] as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.[210]\n\n\nEach inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of *Titanic*, crew members of Leyland Line's *Californian*, Captain Arthur Rostron of *Carpathia* and other experts.[211] The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time.[212] The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,[213] Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,[214] the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed.[213]\n\n\nNeither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice, the disaster was an act of God.[215] The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,[216] noting that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives,[217] and concluded that Smith had done \"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position\". Lord Mersey did, however, find fault with the \"extremely high speed (twenty-two knots) which was maintained\" following numerous ice warnings,[218] noting that \"what was a mistake in the case of the *Titanic* would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future\".[216]\n\n\nThe recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.[219] An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea; both measures are still in force today.[220]\n\n\nOn 18 June 1912, Guglielmo Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service.[221]\n\n\nThe way in which the *Titanic* sank brought to light serious design issues with the *Olympic*-class. This resulted in the *Olympic* receiving a major refit and major design changes for the construction of the *Britannic*.[222]\n\n\nIn August 1912, the liner *Corsican* also struck an iceberg in the Atlantic, severely damaging her bow; however due to the weather being hazy at the time, her speed had been reduced to 'dead slow', so limiting further damage. Although the lifeboats had been swung out, they were not boarded.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Role of SS *Californian*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)SS *Californian*, which had tried to warn *Titanic* of the danger from pack-ice\nOne of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by SS *Californian*, which had been only a few miles from *Titanic* but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. *Californian* had stopped for the night because of icy conditions and warned *Titanic* by radio, but was rebuked by *Titanic*'s senior wireless operator, Jack Phillips.[224]\n\n\nTestimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10 pm, *Californian* observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10 pm) that this was a passenger liner.[224] At 11:50 pm, the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible.[224] Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30 pm and 1:00 am, but were not acknowledged.[225] If *Titanic* was as far from the *Californian* as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact *Titanic* by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached *Titanic* in time to save additional lives.[75]\n\n\nCaptain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00 pm to spend the night;[226] however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10 am that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white.[*clarification needed*] Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50 am and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15 am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.[227]\n\n\n*Californian* eventually responded. At around 5:30 am, Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator Cyril Furmstone Evans, informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of *Titanic*'s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after *Carpathia* had already picked up all the survivors.[228]\n\n\nThe inquiries found that the ship seen by *Californian* was in fact *Titanic* and that it would have been possible for *Californian* to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.[229][o]\n\n\n\n### Survivors and victims[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of the *Titanic*\n\nThe number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, because of a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists.[231] The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.[232] The tables below use figures from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.[106] While the use of the Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to *Titanic* before it sank, the use of wireless did bring *Carpathia* in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.[50]\n\n\nThe water temperature was well below normal in the area where *Titanic* sank. It also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking. Water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be −2 °C (28 °F). Typical water temperatures were normally around 7 °C (45 °F) during mid-April.[233] The coldness of the water was a critical factor, often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water.\n\n\nFewer than a third of those aboard *Titanic* survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard *Carpathia*.[234] The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard *Titanic*. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.[235] In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\n\nThomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[236]\n\n\nThe last living survivor, Millvina Dean from England, who, at only nine weeks old, was the youngest passenger on board, died aged 97 on 31 May 2009.[237] Two special survivors were the stewardess Violet Jessop and the stoker Arthur John Priest,[238] who survived the sinkings of both *Titanic* and HMHS *Britannic* and were aboard RMS *Olympic* when she was rammed in 1911.[239][240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age/sex\n | Class/crew\n | Number aboard\n | Number saved\n | Number lost\n | Percentage saved\n | Percentage lost\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Children\n | First Class\n | 6\n | 5\n | 1\n | 83%\n | 17%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 24\n | 24\n | 0\n | 100%\n | 0%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 79\n | 27\n | 52\n | 34%\n | 66%\n |\n| Women\n | First Class\n | 144\n | 140\n | 4\n | 97%\n | 3%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 93\n | 80\n | 13\n | 86%\n | 14%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 165\n | 76\n | 89\n | 46%\n | 54%\n |\n| Crew\n | 23\n | 20\n | 3\n | 87%\n | 13%\n |\n| Men\n | First Class\n | 175\n | 57\n | 118\n | 33%\n | 67%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 168\n | 14\n | 154\n | 8%\n | 92%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 462\n | 75\n | 387\n | 16%\n | 84%\n |\n| Crew\n | 885\n | 192\n | 693\n | 22%\n | 78%\n |\n| Total\n | 2,224\n | 710\n | 1,514\n | 32%\n | 68%\n |\n\n\n### Retrieval and burial of the dead[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph](image)Markers of *Titanic* victims, Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nOnce the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship CS *Mackay-Bennett* from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to retrieve bodies.[242] Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship *Minia*,[243] lighthouse supply ship *Montmagny* and sealing vessel *Algerine*.[244] Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.[245][p]\n\n\nThe first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS *Mackay-Bennett*, found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port.[247] Captain Larnder of the *Mackay-Bennett* and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first-class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third-class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner, he himself would be contented to be buried at sea.[248]\n\n\nBodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax Registrar of Vital Statistics, John Henry Barnstead, developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in the curling rink of the Mayflower Curling Club and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.[248] Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being Fairview Lawn Cemetery followed by the nearby Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch cemeteries.[249]\n\n\nIn mid-May 1912, RMS *Oceanic* recovered three bodies over 200 miles (320 km) from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth Officer Harold Lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants.[q] After their retrieval from Collapsible A by *Oceanic*, the bodies were buried at sea.[250]\n\n\nThe last *Titanic* body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel *Algerine* on 22 May and buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax on 12 June.[251]\n\n\nOnly 333 bodies of *Titanic* victims were recovered, which amounted to one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles, making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.[252]\n\n\nBodies of passengers of the Titanic were numbered as they were brought aboard. Physical characteristics, clothing, identifying marks, and personal effects were all documented. Personal effects were stored separately, labeled with the same body number, and valuables were locked up by the purser. Without enough material or space to handle bodies and their belongings, the crew had to triage. [253]\n\n\n\n## Wreck[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wreck of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)The bow of *Titanic*, photographed in June 2004\n*Titanic* was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[254] The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700 m) below the surface, where the water pressure is over 6,000 pounds per square inch (40 megapascals),[*dubious – discuss*] about 400 standard atmospheres. A number of expeditions were mounted to find *Titanic* but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard succeeded.[255][256][257]\n\n\nThe team discovered that *Titanic* had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6 km) apart in Titanic Canyon off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located 13.2 miles (21.2 km) from the inaccurate coordinates given by *Titanic*'s radio operators on the night of her sinking,[258] and approximately 715 miles (1,151 km) from Halifax and 1,250 miles (2,012 km) from New York.\n\n\nBoth sections struck the seabed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.[259]\n\n\nThe two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately 5 by 3 miles (8 km × 5 km).[260] It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor.[261] The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of *Titanic*'s victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots—which have proved to be inedible—as the only sign that bodies once lay there.[262]\n\n\nSince its initial discovery, the wreck of *Titanic* has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.[263] In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of *Titanic* would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.[264]\n\n\n\n![](image)The ship's bell, recovered from the wreck\nMany artefacts from *Titanic* have been recovered from the seabed by RMS Titanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.[265] A number of other museums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster.[266]\n\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos[267] were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by Robert Ballard during an expedition led by NOAA in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to *Titanic*'s stern which experts called \"compelling evidence\" that it is the spot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them.[268] The wreck of the *Titanic* falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the *Titanic*, and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.[269][270][271]\n\n\nSubmersible dives in 2019 have found further deterioration of the wreck, including loss of the captain's bathtub.[272] Between 29 July and 4 August 2019, a two-person submersible vehicle that was conducting research and filming a documentary crashed into the wreck. EYOS Expeditions executed the dives. It reported that the strong currents pushed the submersible into the wreck, leaving a red rust stain on the submersible's side. The report did not mention if the *Titanic* sustained damage.[273]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Magellan Ltd., a deep-water seabed-mapping company, announced that they had created a \"digital twin\" of the *Titanic*, showing the wreckage in a level of detail that had never been captured before. The company created the model from some 715,000 3D images, captured over the course of a six-week expedition in the summer of 2022, using two submersibles, named *Romeo* and *Juliet*. They mapped \"every millimetre\" of the wreckage as well as the entire three-nautical-mile (5.6 km) debris field. Creating the model took about eight months.[274][275]\n\n\nOn 18 June 2023, the submersible *Titan*, operated by OceanGate Expeditions, went missing in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. The submersible, designed to carry five people, was carrying an expedition of tourists to view the wreckage of the *Titanic*.[276][277] On 22 June 2023, the operating company announced that they believe the *Titan* crew were lost at sea after a catastrophic implosion of the submersible,[278] and, six days later, the U.S. Coast Guard announced its discovery of “presumed human remains” consistent with such an implosion found within recovered remnants of the *Titan*.[279]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)An ice patrol aircraft inspecting an iceberg\nAfter the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914.[280] The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.[281] Signatories to the Convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example, in Britain, new \"Rules for Life Saving Appliances\" were passed by the Board of Trade on 8 May 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.[282]\n\n\nFurther, the United States government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This Act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations.[283] In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed, it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.[283] In the same year, the Board of Trade chartered the barque *Scotia* to act as a weather ship in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, keeping a look-out for icebergs. A Marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland.[284][285]\n\n\nFinally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the U.S. Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period, there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural legacy of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)*Titanic* Belfast, photographed in November 2017\n*Titanic* has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.[r] For more than 100 years, she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge numbers[287] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[288] and even black mourning teddy bears.[289] The sinking inspired many ballads such as \"The Titanic\".[290] Several survivors wrote books about their experiences,[291] but it was not until 1955 that the first historically accurate book – *A Night to Remember* – was published.[292]\n\n\nThe first film about the disaster, *Saved from the Titanic*, was released only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star—the silent film actress Dorothy Gibson. This film is considered lost.[293] The British film *A Night to Remember* (1958) is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking.[294] The most financially successful by far has been James Cameron's *Titanic* (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time,[295] as well as the winner of 11 Oscars at the 70th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron.[296]\n\n\nThe *Titanic* disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton and Liverpool in England; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Belfast and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.[297] A number of museums around the world have displays on *Titanic*; the most prominent is in Belfast, the ship's birthplace (see below). \n\n\nRMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent *Titanic* exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Nevada which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull. It also runs an exhibition which travels around the world.[298] In Nova Scotia, Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic displays items that were recovered from the sea a few days after the disaster. They include pieces of woodwork such as panelling from the ship's First Class Lounge and an original deckchair,[299] as well as objects removed from the victims.[300] In 2012 the centenary was marked by plays, radio programmes, parades, exhibitions and special trips to the site of the sinking together with commemorative stamps and coins.[186][301][302][303][304] Royal Mail (whose mail was carried by RMS (Royal Mail Ship) *Titanic*) issued ten 1st class UK postage stamps, each with the \"crown seal\", to mark the centenary of the disaster.[305]\n\n\nIn a frequently commented-on literary coincidence, Morgan Robertson authored a novel called *Futility* in 1898 about a fictional British passenger liner with the plot bearing a number of similarities to the *Titanic* disaster. In the novel, the ship is SS *Titan*, a four-stacked liner, the largest in the world and considered unsinkable; like the *Titanic*, she sinks in April after hitting an iceberg and does not have enough lifeboats.[306]\n\n\n\n#### In Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nIt took many decades before the significance of *Titanic* was promoted in Northern Ireland, where it was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. While the rest of the world embraced the glory and tragedy of *Titanic*, it remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th century in its birth city. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to Belfast's pride. Its shipyard was also a place many Catholics regarded as hostile.[307] In the latter half of the century, during a 30-year sectarian conflict, *Titanic* was a reminder of the lack of civil rights that in part contributed towards the Troubles. While the fate of *Titanic* remained a well-known story within local households throughout the 20th century, commercial investment in projects recalling RMS *Titanic*'s legacy was modest because of these issues.[308]\n\n\nAfter the Troubles and Good Friday Agreement, the number of overseas tourists visiting Northern Ireland increased.[309] It was subsequently identified in the Northern Ireland Tourism Board's *Strategic Framework for Action 2004–2007* that the significance of and interest in *Titanic* globally (partly due to the 1997 film *Titanic*) was not being fully exploited as a tourist attraction.[310] Thus, *Titanic* Belfast was spearheaded, along with some smaller projects, such as a *Titanic* memorial.[311]\n\n\nIn 2012 on the ship's centenary, the *Titanic* Belfast visitor attraction was opened on the site of the shipyard where *Titanic* was built.[312] It was Northern Ireland's second most visited tourist attraction with almost 700,000 visitors in 2016.[313]\n\n\nDespite over 1,600 ships being built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast Harbour, Queen's Island became renamed after its most famous ship, Titanic Quarter in 1995. Once a sensitive story, *Titanic* is now considered one of Northern Ireland's most revered and uniting symbols.[314][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 *Titanic* relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions.[315] Eventually, *Titanic* Belfast, Titanic Foundation Limited and the National Museums Northern Ireland joined with the National Maritime Museum as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artefacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. Oceanographer Robert Ballard said he favoured this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where *Titanic* was built) and in Greenwich.[315] The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the 11 October 2018 auction was set at US$21.5 million (£16.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.[316][317] On 17 October 2018, *The New York Times* reported that a consortium of three hedge funds—Apollo Global Management, Alta Fundamental Advisers, and PacBridge Capital Partners—had paid US$19.5 million for the collection.[318] At the time of the purchase, the consortium agreed to continued oversight by the court concerning new exploration or salvage expedition must receive approval from NOAA and the court. Further, the purchase price gives Premier's unsecured creditors an 80% recovery.\n\n\n\n## Appendix[edit]\n\n\nDiagrams of RMS *Titanic*\nDiagram of RMS *Titanic* showing the arrangement of the bulkheads in red.

A project by South African businessman Sarel Gaus was abandoned in 2006, and a project by Australian businessman Clive Palmer was announced in 2012, known as the *Titanic II*.\n\n\nA Chinese shipbuilding company known as Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co., Ltd commenced construction in November 2016 to build a replica ship of the *Titanic* for use in a resort. The vessel was to house many features of the original, such as a ballroom, dining hall, theatre, first-class cabins, economy cabins and swimming pool.[326][327] Tourists were to be able to reside inside the *Titanic* during their time at the resort. It was to be permanently docked at the resort and feature an audiovisual simulation of the sinking, which has caused some criticism.[328] As of 2022, however, it was reportedly only 25% complete,[329] and its website and Twitter account are offline.\n\n\nRMS *Olympic* was the sister ship of the *Titanic*. The interior decoration of the dining salon and the grand staircase were in identical style and created by the same craftsmen. Large parts of the interior of the *Olympic* were later sold and are now in the White Swan Hotel, Alnwick, which gives an impression of how the interior of the *Titanic* looked.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Transport portal\n* ![icon](image)Oceans portal\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* *Titanic* conspiracy theories\n* *Titanic* in popular culture\n* Seamen's Act\n* Lists of shipwrecks\n* *The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility*\n\n\n### Comparable disasters[edit]\n\n\n* SS *Atlantic*, White Star Line ship lost in 1873 with the greatest loss of life for the company before *Titanic*\n* SS *Eastland*, a ship capsizing in 1915 after being fitted with extra lifeboats\n* MS *Estonia*\n* RMS *Empress of Ireland*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The death toll of the sinking of *Tek Sing* in 1822 is not known exactly, but it may have exceeded that of *Titanic*.\n2. **^** Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd, the firm making the ship's davits.[12] Wilding was sacked following the *Titanic* disaster, having been unfairly blamed by Pirrie for the ship's loss.[13]\n3. **^** It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous \"flying\" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film *Titanic* would not have been permitted in real life.\n4. **^** Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by Merry-Joseph Blondel[63]\n5. **^** Measurement of lifeboats: **1–2:** 25'2\" long by 7'2\" wide by 3'2\" deep; 326.6 cubic feet (9.25 m3); **3–16:** 30' long by 9'1\" wide by 4' deep; 655.2 cubic feet (18.55 m3) and **A–D:** 27'5\" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; 376.6 cubic feet (10.66 m3)\n6. **^** Since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was the Cunard Line's 13,000-ton *Lucania*, the Board of Trade had made no provision to increase the existing scale regarding the number of required lifeboats for larger ships, such as the 46,000-ton *Titanic*. Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale \"from time to time\", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried \"uselessly\" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he \"did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]\".[74]\n7. **^** He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.[110]\n8. **^** *Titanic* also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.[114]\n9. **^** Known afterward as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank.\n10. **^** Captain Edward Smith had been in command of *Titanic*'s sister *Olympic* when she in 1911 collided with a warship. Even though that ship was designed to sink others by ramming them, it suffered greater damage than *Olympic*, thereby strengthening the image of the class being unsinkable.[154][155]\n11. **^** The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than 12 to 13 square feet (1.1 to 1.2 m2).[158][82]\n12. **^** An incident confirmed this philosophy while *Titanic* was under construction: the White Star liner *Republic* was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.[161]\n13. **^** The Salvation Army newspaper, *The War Cry*, reported that \"none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish. Night and day that crowd of pale, anxious faces had been waiting patiently for the news that did not come. Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative.\"[188] It was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.[189]\n14. **^** On 23 April, the *Daily Mail* reported: \"Late in the afternoon hope died out. The waiting crowds thinned, and silent men and women sought their homes. In the humbler homes of Southampton there is scarcely a family who has not lost a relative or friend.

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew public attention, spurred major changes in maritime safety regulations, and inspired many artistic works.\n\n\nRMS *Titanic* was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three *Olympic*-class ocean liners built for the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster. *Titanic* was under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from the British Isles, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\n\n\nThe first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, smoking rooms, high-class restaurants and cafes, a Turkish bath, and hundreds of opulent cabins. A high-powered radiotelegraph transmitter was available for sending passenger \"marconigrams\" and for the ship's operational use. *Titanic* had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as \"unsinkable\".\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats. However, she actually carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking (Collapsible A nearly swamped and was filled with a foot of water until rescue; Collapsible B completely overturned while launching). Together, the 20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 people—about half the number of passengers on board, and one-third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (a number consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). When the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nGaumont newsreel containing the only known footage of *Titanic*, 1912\nThe name *Titanic* derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS *Titanic* was the second of the three *Olympic*-class ocean liners—the lead vessel was RMS *Olympic* and the final ship in the class was HMHS *Britannic*.[5] They were by far the largest vessels of the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.[6] The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).\n\n\nThe White Star Line faced an increasing challenge from its main rivals, Cunard—which had recently launched *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, the fastest passenger ships then in service—and the German lines Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. Ismay preferred to compete on size rather than speed and proposed to commission a new class of liners that would be larger than anything that had gone before, as well as being the last word in comfort and luxury.[7] The White Star Line sought an upgrade of its fleet primarily to respond to the introduction of the Cunard giants but also to considerably strengthen its position on the Southampton–Cherbourg–New York service that had been inaugurated in 1907. The new ships would have sufficient speed to maintain a weekly service with only three ships instead of the original four. Thus, the *Olympic* and *Titanic* would replace RMS *Teutonic* of 1889, RMS *Majestic* of 1890 as well as RMS *Adriatic* of 1907. RMS *Oceanic* would remain on the route until the third new ship could be delivered.[*citation needed*] *Majestic* resumed her old position on the White Star Line's New York service post the loss of *Titanic*'.[8]\n\n\nThe ships were constructed by the Belfast shipbuilder Harland & Wolff, which had a long-established relationship with the White Star Line dating back to 1867.[9] Harland and Wolff were given a great deal of latitude in designing ships for the White Star Line; the usual approach was for Wilhelm Wolff to sketch a general concept, which Edward James Harland would turn into a ship design. Cost considerations were a relatively low priority; Harland & Wolff were authorised to spend what it needed on the ships, plus a five per cent profit margin.[9] In the case of the *Olympic*-class ships, a cost of £3 million (approximately £310 million in 2019) for the first two ships was agreed plus \"extras to contract\" and the usual five per cent fee.[10]\n\n\nHarland and Wolff put their leading designers to work designing *Olympic*-class vessels. The design was overseen by Lord Pirrie, a director of both Harland and Wolff and the White Star Line; naval architect Thomas Andrews, the managing director of Harland and Wolff's design department; Edward Wilding, Andrews's deputy and responsible for calculating the ship's design, stability and trim; and Alexander Carlisle, the shipyard's chief draughtsman and general manager.[11] Carlisle's responsibilities included the decorations, equipment, and all general arrangements, including the implementation of an efficient lifeboat davit design.[b]\n\n\nOn July 29, 1908, Harland and Wolff presented the drawings to J. Bruce Ismay and other White Star Line executives. Ismay approved the design and signed three \"letters of agreement\" two days later, authorising the start of construction.[14] At this point, the first ship—which was later to become *Olympic*—had no name but was referred to simply as \"Number 400\", as it was Harland and Wolff's four-hundredth hull. *Titanic* was based on a revised version of the same design and was given the number 401.[15]\n\n\n\n## Dimensions and layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Starboard view of *Titanic*\n*Titanic* was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m).\n\n\nHer total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m).[16] She measured 46,329 GRT and 21,831 NRT[17] and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced 52,310 tons.[5]\nAll three of the *Olympic*-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers' quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:\n\n\n\n* The **boat deck**, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912 that *Titanic*'s lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck, extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so that the view would not be spoiled.[18][19]\n* **A Deck**, also called the **promenade deck**, extended along the entire 546 feet (166 m) length of the superstructure. It was reserved exclusively for First Class passengers and contained First Class cabins, the First Class lounge, smoke room, reading and writing rooms, and Palm Court.[18]\n* **B Deck**, the **bridge deck**, was the top weight-bearing deck and the uppermost level of the hull. More First Class passenger accommodations were located here with six palatial staterooms (cabins) featuring their own private promenades. On *Titanic*, the à la carte restaurant and the Café Parisien provided luxury dining facilities to First Class passengers. Both were run by subcontracted chefs and their staff; all were lost in the disaster. The Second Class smoking room and entrance hall were both located on this deck. The raised forecastle of the ship was forward of the bridge deck, accommodating Number 1 hatch (the main hatch through to the cargo holds), numerous pieces of machinery and the anchor housings.[c] Aft of the bridge deck was the raised poop deck, 106 feet (32 m) long, used as a promenade by Third Class passengers. It was where many of *Titanic*'s passengers and crew made their last stand as the ship sank. The forecastle and poop deck were separated from the bridge deck by well decks.[20][21]\n* **C Deck**, the **shelter deck**, was the highest deck to run uninterrupted from stem to stern. It included both well decks; the aft one served as part of the Third Class promenade. Crew cabins were housed below the forecastle and Third Class public rooms were housed below the poop deck. In between were the majority of First Class cabins and the Second Class library.[20][22]\n* **D Deck**, the **saloon deck**, was dominated by three large public rooms—the First Class reception room, the First Class dining saloon and the Second Class dining saloon. An open space was provided for Third Class passengers. First, Second and Third Class passengers had cabins on this deck, with berths for firemen located in the bow. It was the highest level reached by the ship's watertight bulkheads (though only by eight of the fifteen bulkheads).[20][23]\n* **E Deck**, the **upper deck**, was predominantly used for passenger accommodation for all three classes plus berths for cooks, seamen, stewards and trimmers. Along its length ran a long passageway nicknamed 'Scotland Road', in reference to a famous street in Liverpool. Scotland Road was used by Third Class passengers and crew members.[20][24]\n* **F Deck**, the **middle deck**, was the last complete deck, and mainly accommodated Second and Third Class passengers and several departments of the crew. The Third Class dining saloon was located here, as were the swimming pool, Turkish bath and kennels.[20][24][25]\n* **G Deck**, the **lower deck**, was the lowest complete deck that carried passengers, and had the lowest portholes, just above the waterline. The squash court was located here along with the travelling post office where letters and parcels were sorted ready for delivery when the ship docked. Food was also stored here. The deck was interrupted at several points by orlop (partial) decks over the boiler, engine and turbine rooms.[20][26]\n* The **orlop decks**, and the **tank top** below that, were on the lowest level of the ship, below the waterline. The orlop decks were used as cargo spaces, while the tank top—the inner bottom of the ship's hull—provided the platform on which the ship's boilers, engines, turbines and electrical generators were housed. This area of the ship was occupied by the engine and boiler rooms, areas which passengers would have been prohibited from seeing. They were connected with higher levels of the ship by flights of stairs; twin spiral stairways near the bow provided access up to D Deck.[20][26]\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)RMS *Olympic*'s rudder with central and port wing propellers;[27] the man at the bottom shows scale.[28]\n*Titanic* propulsion was supplied by three main engines—two reciprocating four-cylinder, triple-expansion steam engines and one centrally placed low-pressure Parsons turbine—each driving a propeller. The two reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 horsepower (22,000 kW). The output of the steam turbine was 16,000 horsepower (12,000 kW).[16] The White Star Line had used the same combination of engines on an earlier liner, *Laurentic*, where it had been a great success.[29] It provided a good combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to propel an *Olympic*-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*.[30] By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive power increased, while using the same amount of steam.[31]\n\n\nThe two reciprocating engines were each 63 feet (19 m) long and weighed 720 tons, with their bedplates contributing a further 195 tons.[30] They were powered by steam produced in 29 boilers, 24 of which were double-ended and five single-ended, which contained a total of 159 furnaces.[32] The boilers were 15 feet 9 inches (4.80 m) in diameter and 20 feet (6.1 m) long, each weighing 91.5 tons and capable of holding 48.5 tons of water.[33]\n\n\nThey were fuelled by burning coal, 6,611 tons of which could be carried in *Titanic*'s bunkers, with a further 1,092 tons in Hold 3. The furnaces required over 600 tons of coal a day to be shovelled into them by hand, requiring the services of 176 firemen working around the clock.[34] 100 tons of ash a day had to be disposed of by ejecting it into the sea.[35] The work was relentless, dirty and dangerous, and although firemen were paid relatively well,[34] there was a high suicide rate among those who worked in that capacity.[36]\n\n\nExhaust steam leaving the reciprocating engines was fed into the turbine, which was situated aft. From there it passed into a surface condenser, to increase the efficiency of the turbine and so that the steam could be condensed back into water and reused.[37] The engines were attached directly to long shafts which drove the propellers. There were three, one for each engine; the outer (or wing) propellers were the largest, each carrying three blades of manganese-bronze alloy with a total diameter of 23.5 feet (7.2 m).[33] The middle propeller was slightly smaller at 17 feet (5.2 m) in diameter,[38] and could be stopped but not reversed.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s electrical plant was capable of producing more power than an average city power station of the time.[39] Immediately aft of the turbine engine were four 400 kW steam-driven electric generators, used to provide electrical power to the ship, plus two 30 kW auxiliary generators for emergency use.[40] Their location in the stern of the ship meant they remained operational until the last few minutes before the ship sank.[41]\n\n\n*Titanic* lacked a searchlight in accordance with the ban on the use of searchlights in the merchant navy.[42][43]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\n#### Compartments and funnels[edit]\n\n\nThe interiors of the *Olympic*-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary compartments divided by 15 bulkheads that extended above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off the compartments in the event of an emergency.[44] The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak, while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation.[45] Standing above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops; only three were functional—the aftmost one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and kitchen ventilation. Two masts, each 155 ft (47 m) high, supported derricks for working cargo.\n\n\n\n#### Rudder and steering engines[edit]\n\n\nDue to the size and weight of *Titanic*'s rudder—at 78 feet 8 inches (23.98 m) high and 15 feet 3 inches (4.65 m) long, weighing over 100 tons—that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines were installed, though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.[46] As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes connected to two steam capstans.[47] The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two kedging anchors).[47]\n\n\n\n#### Water, ventilation and heating[edit]\n\n\nThe ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while *Titanic* was in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Radio communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMarconi Company receiving equipment for a 5-kilowatt ocean liner station (in the picture, the wireless radio room of *Titanic*'s sister ship, *Olympic*)\n![](image)\nThe only known picture of *Titanic*'s wireless radio room, taken by the Catholic priest Francis Browne. Harold Bride is seated at the desk.\n\n*Titanic*'s radiotelegraph equipment (then known as wireless telegraphy) was leased to the White Star Line by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, which also supplied two of its employees, Jack Phillips and Harold Bride, as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and receiving passenger telegrams (\"marconigrams\"), but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice warnings.[48][49][50]\nThe radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A soundproofed \"Silent Room\", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter and a motor-generator used for producing alternating currents. The operators' living quarters were adjacent to the working office. The ship was equipped with a 'state of the art' 5-kilowatt rotary spark-gap transmitter, with the wireless telegraph call sign MGY, and communication was in Morse code. This transmitter was one of the first Marconi installations to use a rotary spark-gap, which gave *Titanic* a distinctive musical tone that could be readily distinguished from other signals. The transmitter was one of the most powerful in the world and guaranteed to broadcast over a radius of 350 miles (304 nmi; 563 km). An elevated T-antenna that spanned the length of the ship was used for transmitting and receiving. The normal operating frequency was 500 kHz (600 m wavelength); however, the equipment could also operate on the \"short\" wavelength of 1,000 kHz (300 m wavelength) that was employed by smaller vessels with shorter antennas.[51]\n\n\n\n### Passenger facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First-class facilities of the *Titanic* and Second- and third-class facilities on *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Grand Staircase of *Titanic*\n\nThe passenger facilities aboard *Titanic* aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to *Titanic*'s general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy style of a manor house or an English country house.[52]\n\n\n*Titanic* was laid out in a much lighter style similar to that of contemporary high-class hotels—the Ritz Hotel was a reference point—with First Class cabins finished in the Empire style.[52] A variety of other decorative styles, ranging from the Renaissance to Louis XV, were used to decorate cabins and public rooms in First and Second Class areas of the ship. The aim was to convey an impression that the passengers were in a floating hotel rather than a ship; as one passenger recalled, on entering the ship's interior a passenger would \"at once lose the feeling that we are on board ship, and seem instead to be entering the hall of some great house on shore\".[53]\n\n\nAmong the more novel features available to first-class passengers was a 7 ft (2.1 m) deep saltwater swimming pool, a gymnasium, a squash court, and a Turkish bath which comprised electric bath, steam room, cool room, massage room, and hot room.[53] First-class common rooms were impressive in scope and lavishly decorated. They included a lounge in the style of the Palace of Versailles, an enormous reception room, a men's smoking room, and a reading and writing room. There was an à la carte restaurant in the style of the Ritz Hotel which was run as a concession by the famous Italian restaurateur Gaspare Gatti.[54] A *Café Parisien* decorated in the style of a French sidewalk café, complete with ivy-covered trellises and wicker furniture, was run as an annex to the restaurant. For an extra cost, first-class passengers could enjoy the finest French *haute cuisine* in the most luxurious of surroundings.[55] There was also a *Verandah Café* where tea and light refreshments were served, that offered grand views of the ocean. At 114 ft (35 m) long by 92 ft (28 m) wide, the dining saloon on D Deck, designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll, was the largest room afloat and could seat almost 600 passengers at a time.[56]\n\n\n\n* ![The Forward First Class Grand Staircase of Titanic's sister ship RMS Olympic.

They reflected the improved standards which the White Star Line had adopted for trans-Atlantic immigrant and lower-class travel. On most other North Atlantic passenger ships at the time, Third Class accommodations consisted of little more than open dormitories in the forward end of the vessels, in which hundreds of people were confined, often without adequate food or toilet facilities. \n\n\nThe White Star Line had long since broken that mould. As seen aboard *Titanic*, all White Star Line passenger ships divided their Third Class accommodations into two sections, always at opposite ends of the vessel from one another. The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and ten passengers.[57]\n\n\nThird Class accommodations also included their own dining rooms, as well as public gathering areas including adequate open deck space, which aboard *Titanic* comprised the poop deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck which could be used as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a general room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper-class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.\n\n\nLeisure facilities were provided for all three classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the open deck, promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing to inform the public which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.[58]\n\n\nOne of *Titanic*'s most distinctive features was her First Class staircase, known as the Grand Staircase or Grand Stairway. Built of solid English oak with a sweeping curve, the staircase descended through seven decks of the ship, between the boat deck to E deck, before terminating in a simplified single flight on F Deck.[59] It was capped with a dome of wrought iron and glass that admitted natural light to the stairwell. Each landing off the staircase gave access to ornate entrance halls panelled in the William & Mary style and lit by ormolu and crystal light fixtures.[60]\n\n\nAt the uppermost landing was a large carved wooden panel containing a clock, with figures of \"Honour and Glory Crowning Time\" flanking the clock face.[59] The Grand Staircase was destroyed during the sinking and is now just a void in the ship which modern explorers have used to access the lower decks.[61] During the filming of James Cameron's *Titanic* in 1997, his replica of the Grand Staircase was ripped from its foundations by the force of the inrushing water on the set. It has been suggested that during the real event, the entire Grand Staircase was ejected upwards through the dome.[62]\n\n\n\n### Mail and cargo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*La Circassienne au Bain* by Merry-Joseph Blondel; the most highly valued item of cargo lost on *Titanic*. This image is of a copy.[d]\nAlthough *Titanic* was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail (and also for the United States Post Office Department). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie (bullion, coins and other valuables), 26,800 cubic feet (760 m3) of space in her holds was allocated. The Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks (three Americans and two Britons), who worked 13 hours a day, seven days a week, sorting up to 60,000 items daily.[64]\n\n\nThe ship's passengers brought with them a huge amount of baggage; another 19,455 cubic feet (550.9 m3) was taken up by first- and second-class baggage. In addition, there was a considerable quantity of regular cargo, ranging from furniture to foodstuffs, and a 1912 Renault Type CE Coupe de Ville motor car.[65] Despite later myths, the cargo on *Titanic*'s maiden voyage was fairly mundane; there was no gold, exotic minerals or diamonds, and one of the more famous items lost in the shipwreck, a jewelled copy of the *Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam*, was valued at only £405 (£50,600 today).[66] According to the claims for compensation filed with Commissioner Gilchrist, following the conclusion of the Senate Inquiry, the single most highly valued item of luggage or cargo was a large neoclassical oil painting entitled *La Circassienne au Bain* by French artist Merry-Joseph Blondel. The painting's owner, first-class passenger Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson, filed a claim for $100,000 (equivalent to $2,300,000 in 2023) in compensation for the loss of the artwork.[63]\n\n\n*Titanic* was equipped with eight electric cranes, four electric winches and three steam winches to lift cargo and baggage in and out of the holds. It is estimated that the ship used some 415 tons of coal whilst in Southampton, simply generating steam to operate the cargo winches and provide heat and light.[67]\n\n\n\n### Lifeboats[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lifeboats of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)A collapsible lifeboat with canvas sides\nLike *Olympic*, *Titanic* carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats with a capacity of 65 people each and four Engelhardt \"collapsible\" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two emergency cutters with a capacity of 40 people each.[68][e] *Olympic* carried at least two collapsible boats on either side of her number one funnel.[69][70] All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and B, connected to davits by ropes. Those on the starboard side were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered 2–16 from bow to stern.[71]\n\n\nBoth cutters were kept swung out, hanging from the davits, ready for immediate use, while collapsible lifeboats C and D were stowed on the boat deck (connected to davits) immediately inboard of boats 1 and 2 respectively. A and B were stored on the roof of the officers' quarters, on either side of number 1 funnel. There were no davits to lower them and their weight would make them difficult to launch by hand.[71] Each boat carried (among other things) food, water, blankets, and a spare life belt. Lifeline ropes on the boats' sides enabled them to save additional people from the water if necessary.\n\n\n*Titanic* had 16 sets of davits, each able to handle four lifeboats as Carlisle had planned. This gave *Titanic* the ability to carry up to 64 wooden lifeboats[72] which would have been enough for 4,000 people—considerably more than her actual capacity. However, the White Star Line decided that only 16 wooden lifeboats and four collapsibles would be carried, which could accommodate 1,178 people, only one-third of *Titanic*'s total capacity. At the time, the Board of Trade's regulations required British vessels over 10,000 tons to only carry 16 lifeboats with a capacity of 990 occupants.[68]\n\n\nTherefore, the White Star Line actually provided more lifeboat accommodation than was legally required.[73][f] At the time, lifeboats were intended to ferry survivors from a sinking ship to a rescuing ship—not keep afloat the whole population or power them to shore. Had SS *Californian* responded to *Titanic*'s distress calls, the lifeboats might have been able to ferry all passengers to safety as planned.[75]\n\n\n\n## Building and preparing the ship[edit]\n\n\n### Construction, launch and fitting-out[edit]\n\n\n![Construction in gantry, bow is seen](image)\nConstruction in gantry, 1909–11\n![Launch, 1911; ship with unfinished superstructure](image)\nLaunch, 1911 (unfinished superstructure)\n![Fitting-out, 1911–12: Ship is seen in dock](image)\nFitting-out, 1911–12\n\nThe sheer size of the *Olympic class* vessels posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff; no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.[76] The ships were constructed on Queen's Island, now known as the Titanic Quarter, in Belfast Harbour. Harland and Wolff had to demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to accommodate both ships.[10] Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by Sir William Arrol & Co., a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the Forth Bridge and London's Tower Bridge. The Arrol Gantry stood 228 feet (69 m) high, was 270 feet (82 m) wide and 840 feet (260 m) long, and weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane, capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.[77]\n\n\nThe construction of *Olympic* and *Titanic* took place virtually in parallel, with *Olympic*'s keel laid down first on 16 December 1908 and *Titanic*'s on 31 March 1909.[15] Both ships took about 26 months to build and followed much the same construction process. They were designed essentially as an enormous floating box girder, with the keel acting as a backbone and the frames of the hull forming the ribs. At the base of the ships, a double bottom 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) deep supported 300 frames, each between 24 inches (61 cm) and 36 inches (91 cm) apart and measuring up to about 66 feet (20 m) long. They terminated at the bridge deck (B Deck) and were covered with steel plates which formed the outer skin of the ships.[78]\n\n\nThe 2,000 hull plates were single pieces of rolled steel plate, mostly up to 6 feet (1.8 m) wide and 30 feet (9.1 m) long and weighing between 2.5 and 3 tons.[79] Their thickness varied from 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm).[44] The plates were laid in a clinkered (overlapping) fashion from the keel to the bilge. Above that point they were laid in the \"in and out\" fashion, where strake plating was applied in bands (the \"in strakes\") with the gaps covered by the \"out strakes\", overlapping on the edges. Commercial oxy-fuel and electric arc welding methods, ubiquitous in fabrication today, were still in their infancy; like most other iron and steel structures of the era, the hull was held together with over three million iron and steel rivets, which by themselves weighed over 1,200 tons. They were fitted using hydraulic machines or were hammered in by hand.[80] In the 1990s some material scientists concluded[81] that the steel plate used for the ship was subject to being especially brittle when cold, and that this brittleness exacerbated the impact damage and hastened the sinking. It is believed that, by the standards of the time, the steel plate's quality was good, not faulty, but that it was inferior to what would be used for shipbuilding purposes in later decades, owing to advances in the metallurgy of steelmaking.[81] As for the rivets, considerable emphasis has also been placed on their quality and strength.[82][83][84][85][86]\n\n\nAmong the last items to be fitted on *Titanic* before the ship's launch were her two side anchors and one centre anchor. The anchors themselves were a challenge to make, with the centre anchor being the largest ever forged by hand and weighing nearly 16 tons. Twenty Clydesdale draught horses were needed to haul the centre anchor by wagon from the Noah Hingley & Sons Ltd forge shop in Netherton, near Dudley, United Kingdom to the Dudley railway station two miles away. From there it was shipped by rail to Fleetwood in Lancashire before being loaded aboard a ship and sent to Belfast.[87]\n\n\nThe work of constructing the ships was difficult and dangerous. For the 15,000 men who worked at Harland and Wolff at the time,[88] safety precautions were rudimentary at best; a lot of the work was carried out without equipment like hard hats or hand guards on machinery. As a result, during *Titanic*'s construction, 246 injuries were recorded, 28 of them \"severe\", such as arms severed by machines or legs crushed under falling pieces of steel. Six people died on the ship herself while she was being constructed and fitted out, and another two died in the shipyard workshops and sheds.[89] Just before the launch a worker was killed when a piece of wood fell on him.[90]\n\n\n*Titanic* was launched at 12:15 pm on 31 May 1911 in the presence of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpont Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers.[91][92] Twenty-two tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River Lagan.[90] In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne.[91] The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, over the course of the next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.[93]\n\n\nAlthough *Titanic* was virtually identical to the class's lead ship *Olympic*, a few changes were made to distinguish both ships. The most noticeable exterior difference was that *Titanic* (and the third vessel in class, *Britannic*) had a steel screen with sliding windows installed along the forward half of the A Deck promenade. This was installed as a last minute change at the personal request of Bruce Ismay, and was intended to provide additional shelter to First Class passengers.[94] Extensive changes were made to B Deck on *Titanic* as the promenade space in this deck, which had proven unpopular on *Olympic*, was converted into additional First Class cabins, including two opulent parlour suites with their own private promenade spaces. The *À la Carte* restaurant was also enlarged and the *Café Parisien*, an entirely new feature which did not exist on *Olympic*, was added. These changes made *Titanic* slightly heavier than her sister, and thus she could claim to be the largest ship afloat. The work took longer than expected due to design changes requested by Ismay and a temporary pause in work occasioned by the need to repair *Olympic*, which had been in a collision in September 1911. Had *Titanic* been finished earlier, she might well have missed her collision with an iceberg.[90]\n\n\n\n### Sea trials[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Titanic* departing Belfast for sea trials on 2 April 1912\n*Titanic*'s sea trials began at 6 am on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.[95] The trials were delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.[96] Aboard were 78 stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard. Representatives of various companies travelled on *Titanic*'s sea trials: Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding of Harland and Wolff, and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend. Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.[97]\n\n\nThe sea trials consisted of a number of tests of her handling characteristics, carried out first in Belfast Lough and then in the open waters of the Irish Sea. Over the course of about 12 hours, *Titanic* was driven at different speeds, her turning ability was tested and a \"crash stop\" was performed in which the engines were reversed full ahead to full astern, bringing her to a stop in 850 yd (777 m) or 3 minutes and 15 seconds.[98] The ship covered a distance of about 80 nautical miles (92 mi; 150 km), averaging 18 knots (21 mph; 33 km/h) and reaching a maximum speed of just under 21 knots (24 mph; 39 km/h).[99]\n\n\nOn returning to Belfast at about 7 pm, the surveyor signed an \"Agreement and Account of Voyages and Crew\", valid for 12 months, which declared the ship seaworthy. An hour later, *Titanic* departed Belfast to head to Southampton, a voyage of about 570 nautical miles (660 mi; 1,060 km). After a journey lasting about 28 hours, she arrived about midnight on 4 April and was towed to the port's Berth 44, ready for the arrival of her passengers and the remainder of her crew.[100]\n\n\n\n## Maiden voyage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Titanic* at Southampton docks, prior to departure\n![](image)\n*Titanic* in Cork harbour, 11 April 1912\n\nBoth *Olympic* and *Titanic* registered Liverpool as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line, as well as Cunard, were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the *Olympic*, most British ocean liners for both Cunard and White Star, such as *Lusitania* and *Mauretania*, sailed from Liverpool followed by a port of call in Queenstown, Ireland. Since the company's founding in 1845, a vast majority of their operations had taken place from Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star Line established another service from Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's \"Express Service\". Southampton had many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.[101]\n\n\nIn addition, Southampton, being on the south coast, allowed ships to easily cross the English Channel and make a port of call on the northern coast of France, usually at Cherbourg. This allowed British ships to pick up clientele from continental Europe before recrossing the channel and picking up passengers at Queenstown. The Southampton-Cherbourg-New York run would become so popular that most British ocean liners began using the port after World War I. Out of respect for Liverpool, ships continued to be registered there until the early 1960s. *Queen Elizabeth 2* was one of the first ships registered in Southampton when introduced into service by Cunard in 1969.[101]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage was intended to be the first of many trans-Atlantic crossings between Southampton and New York via Cherbourg and Queenstown on westbound runs, returning via Plymouth in England while eastbound. Indeed, her entire schedule of voyages through to December 1912 still exists.[102] When the route was established, four ships were assigned to the service. In addition to *Teutonic* and *Majestic*, RMS *Oceanic* and the brand new RMS *Adriatic* sailed the route. When the *Olympic* entered service in June 1911, she replaced *Teutonic*, which after completing her last run on the service in late April was transferred to the Dominion Line's Canadian service. The following August, *Adriatic* was transferred to White Star Line's main Liverpool-New York service, and in November, *Majestic* was withdrawn from service impending the arrival of *Titanic* in the coming months, and was mothballed as a reserve ship.[103][104]\n\n\nWhite Star Line's initial plans for *Olympic* and *Titanic* on the Southampton run followed the same routine as their predecessors had done before them. Each would sail once every three weeks from Southampton and New York, usually leaving at noon each Wednesday from Southampton and each Saturday from New York, thus enabling the White Star Line to offer weekly sailings in each direction. Special trains were scheduled from London and Paris to convey passengers to Southampton and Cherbourg respectively.[104] The deep-water dock at Southampton, then known as the \"*White Star Dock*\", had been specially constructed to accommodate the new *Olympic*-class liners, and had opened in 1911.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crew[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crew of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)Edward Smith, captain of *Titanic*, in 1911\n*Titanic* had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.[106] Like other vessels of her time, she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.[107] The process of signing up recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew during *Titanic*'s sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.[108]\n\n\nCaptain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains, was transferred from *Olympic* to take command of *Titanic*.[109] Henry Tingle Wilde also came across from *Olympic* to take the post of chief mate. *Titanic*'s previously designated chief mate and first officer, William McMaster Murdoch and Charles Lightoller, were bumped down to the ranks of first and second officer respectively. The original second officer, David Blair, was dropped altogether.[110][g] The third officer was Herbert Pitman, the only deck officer who was not a member of the Royal Naval Reserve. Pitman was the second-to-last surviving officer.\n\n\n*Titanic*'s crew were divided into three principal departments: Deck, with 66 crew; Engine, with 325; and Victualling, with 494.[111] The vast majority of the crew were thus not seamen but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines, or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers.[112] Of these, over 97% were male; just 23 of the crew were female, mainly stewardesses.[113] The rest represented a great variety of professions—bakers, chefs, butchers, fishmongers, dishwashers, stewards, gymnasium instructors, laundrymen, waiters, bed-makers, cleaners, and even a printer,[113] who produced a daily newspaper for passengers called the *Atlantic Daily Bulletin* with the latest news received by the ship's wireless operators.[48][h]\n\n\nMost of the crew signed on in Southampton on 6 April;[15] in all, 699 of the crew came from there, and 40% were natives of the town.[113] A few specialist staff were self-employed or were subcontractors. These included the five postal clerks, who worked for the Royal Mail and the United States Post Office Department, the staff of the First Class *À La Carte* Restaurant and the Café Parisien, the radio operators (who were employed by Marconi) and the eight musicians, who were employed by an agency and travelled as second-class passengers.[115] Crew pay varied greatly, from Captain Smith's £105 a month (equivalent to £13,100 today) to the £3 10*s* (£440 today) that stewardesses earned. The lower-paid victualling staff could, however, supplement their wages substantially through tips from passengers.[114]\n\n\n\n### Passengers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of *Titanic*\n\nSee also: Animals aboard *Titanic*\n\n![](image)John Jacob Astor IV in 1909. He was the wealthiest person aboard *Titanic*; he did not survive.\n*Titanic*'s passengers numbered approximately 1,317 people: 324 in First Class, 284 in Second Class, and 709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard, the largest number of whom were in Third Class.[116] The ship was considerably under-capacity on her maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006 Third Class.[117]\n\n\nUsually, a high-prestige vessel like *Titanic* could expect to be fully booked on its maiden voyage. However, a national coal strike in the UK had caused considerable disruption to shipping schedules in the spring of 1912, causing many crossings to be cancelled. Many would-be passengers chose to postpone their travel plans until the strike was over. The strike had finished a few days before *Titanic* sailed; however, that was too late to have much of an effect. *Titanic* was able to sail on the scheduled date only because coal was transferred from other vessels which were tied up at Southampton, such as SS *City of New York* and RMS *Oceanic*, as well as coal that *Olympic* had brought back from a previous voyage to New York, which had been stored at the White Star Dock.[94]\n\n\nSome of the most prominent people of the day booked a passage aboard *Titanic*, travelling in First Class. Among them (with those who perished marked with a dagger†) were the American millionaire John Jacob Astor IV† and his wife, Madeleine Force Astor (with John Jacob Astor VI in utero); industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim†; painter and sculptor Francis Davis Millet†; Macy's owner Isidor Straus† and his wife, Ida†; Denver millionairess Margaret \"Molly\" Brown;[i] Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon and his wife, couturière Lucy (Lady Duff-Gordon); Lieut. Col. Arthur Peuchen; writer and historian Archibald Gracie; cricketer and businessman John B. Thayer† with his wife, Marian, and son Jack; George Dunton Widener† with his wife, Eleanor, and son Harry†; Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes; Mr.† and Mrs. Charles M. Hays; Mr. and Mrs. Henry S. Harper; Mr.† and Mrs. Walter D. Douglas; Mr.† and Mrs. George D. Wick; Mr.† and Mrs. Henry B. Harris; Mr.† and Mrs. Arthur L. Ryerson; Mr.† and Mrs.† Hudson J. C. Allison; Mr. and Mrs. Dickinson Bishop; noted architect Edward Austin Kent†; brewery heir Harry Molson†; tennis players Karl Behr and Dick Williams; author and socialite Helen Churchill Candee; future lawyer and suffragette Elsie Bowerman and her mother Edith; journalist and social reformer William Thomas Stead†; journalist and fashion buyer Edith Rosenbaum, Philadelphia and New York socialite Edith Corse Evans†; wealthy divorcée Charlotte Drake Cardeza; French sculptor Paul Chevré; author Jacques Futrelle† with his wife May; silent film actress Dorothy Gibson with her mother Pauline; President of the Swiss Bankverein, Col. Alfons Simonius-Blumer; James A. Hughes's daughter Eloise; banker Robert Williams Daniel; the chairman of the Holland America Line, Johan Reuchlin [de]; Arthur Wellington Ross's son John H. Ross; Washington Roebling's nephew Washington A. Roebling II; Andrew Saks's daughter Leila Saks Meyer with her husband Edgar Joseph Meyer† (son of Marc Eugene Meyer); William A. Clark's nephew Walter M. Clark with his wife, Virginia; a great-great-grandson of soap manufacturer Andrew Pears, Thomas C. Pears, with wife; John S. Pillsbury's honeymooning grandson John P. Snyder and wife Nelle; Dorothy Parker's New York manufacturer uncle Martin Rothschild with his wife, Elizabeth; and many others.[118]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s owner J. P. Morgan was scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage but cancelled at the last minute.[119] Also aboard the ship were the White Star Line's managing director J. Bruce Ismay and *Titanic*'s designer Thomas Andrews†, who was on board to observe any problems and assess the general performance of the new ship.[120]\n\n\nThe exact number of people aboard is not known, as not all of those who had booked tickets made it to the ship; about 50 people cancelled for various reasons,[121] and not all of those who boarded stayed aboard for the entire journey.[122] Fares varied depending on class and season. Third Class fares from London, Southampton, or Queenstown cost £7 5*s* (equivalent to £900 today) while the cheapest First Class fares cost £23 (£2,900 today).[104] The most expensive First Class suites were to have cost up to £870 in high season (£109,000 today).[117]\n\n\n\n### Collecting passengers[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew, the passengers began arriving at 9:30 am, when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, alongside *Titanic*'s berth.[123] The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins, and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.[124] Third Class passengers were inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the United States – a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who failed the examination back across the Atlantic.[121] In all, 920 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Southampton – 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.[94]\n\n\nThe maiden voyage began at noon, as scheduled. An accident was narrowly averted only a few minutes later, as *Titanic* passed the moored liners SS *City of New York* of the American Line and *Oceanic* of the White Star Line, the latter of which would have been her running mate on the service from Southampton. Her huge displacement caused both of the smaller ships to be lifted by a bulge of water and then dropped into a trough. *New York*'s mooring cables could not take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her around stern-first towards *Titanic*. A nearby tugboat, *Vulcan*, came to the rescue by taking *New York* under tow, and Captain Smith ordered *Titanic*'s engines to be put \"full astern\".[125] The two ships avoided a collision by a distance of about 4 feet (1.2 m). The incident delayed *Titanic*'s departure for about an hour, while the drifting *New York* was brought under control.[126][127]\n\n\nAfter making it safely through the complex tides and channels of Southampton Water and the Solent, *Titanic* disembarked the Southampton pilot at the Nab Lightship and headed out into the English Channel.[128] She headed for the French port of Cherbourg, a journey of 77 nautical miles (89 mi; 143 km).[129] The weather was windy, very fine but cold and overcast.[130] Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship the size of *Titanic*, tenders had to be used to transfer passengers from shore to ship. The White Star Line operated two at Cherbourg, SS *Traffic* and SS *Nomadic*. Both had been designed specifically as tenders for the *Olympic*-class liners and were launched shortly after *Titanic*.[131] (*Nomadic* is the only surviving White Star Line ship) Four hours after *Titanic* left Southampton, she arrived at Cherbourg and was met by the tenders. There, 274 additional passengers were taken aboard – 142 First Class, 30 Second Class, and 102 Third Class. Twenty-four passengers left aboard the tenders to be conveyed to shore, having booked only a cross-Channel passage. The process was completed within only 90 minutes and at 8 pm *Titanic* weighed anchor and left for Queenstown[132] with the weather continuing cold and windy.[130]\n\n\nAt 11:30 am on Thursday 11 April, *Titanic* arrived at Cork Harbour on the south coast of Ireland. It was a partly cloudy but relatively warm day, with a brisk wind.[130] Again, the dock facilities were not suitable for a ship of *Titanic*'s size, and tenders were used to bring passengers aboard. In all, 123 passengers boarded *Titanic* at Queenstown – three First Class, seven Second Class and 113 Third Class. In addition to the 24 cross-Channel passengers who had disembarked at Cherbourg, another seven passengers had booked an overnight passage from Southampton to Queenstown. Among the seven was Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee who was a keen photographer and took many photographs aboard *Titanic*, including one of the last known photographs of the ship. The very last one was taken by another cross-channel passenger Kate Odell.[133] A decidedly unofficial departure was that of a crew member, stoker John Coffey, a Queenstown native who sneaked off the ship by hiding under mail bags being transported to shore.[134] *Titanic* weighed anchor for the last time at 1:30 pm and departed on her westward journey across the Atlantic.[134]\n\n\n\n### Atlantic crossing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Titanic* itinerary on the Northern Atlantic, from Fastnet Light (Ireland) to Ambrose Light (New York)\n![](image)Ice warnings prior to the accident of 14 April\n*Titanic* was planned to arrive at New York Pier 59[135] on the morning of 17 April.[136] After leaving Queenstown, *Titanic* followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock,[137] a distance of some 55 nautical miles (63 mi; 102 km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860 mi; 3,000 km) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as \"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. *Titanic* sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177 mi; 1,895 km) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[138] The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222 mi; 357 km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.[139]\n\n\nFrom 11 April to local apparent noon the next day, *Titanic* covered 484 nautical miles (557 mi; 896 km); the following day, 519 nautical miles (597 mi; 961 km); and by noon on the final day of her voyage, 546 nautical miles (628 mi; 1,011 km). From then until the time of her sinking, she travelled another 258 nautical miles (297 mi; 478 km), averaging about 21 knots (24 mph; 39 km/h).[140]\n\n\nThe weather cleared as she left Ireland under cloudy skies with a headwind. Temperatures remained fairly mild on Saturday 13 April, but the following day *Titanic* crossed a cold weather front with strong winds and waves of up to 8 feet (2.4 m). These died down as the day progressed until, by the evening of Sunday 14 April, it became clear, calm, and very cold.[141]\n\n\nThe first three days of the voyage from Queenstown had passed without apparent incident. A fire had begun in one of *Titanic*'s coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into its voyage,[142] but passengers were unaware of this situation. Fires occurred frequently on board steamships at the time, due to spontaneous combustion of the coal.[143] The fires had to be extinguished with fire hoses by moving the coal on top to another bunker and by removing the burning coal and feeding it into the furnace.[144] The fire was finally extinguished on 14 April.[145][146] There has been some speculation and discussion as to whether this fire and attempts to extinguish it may have made the ship more vulnerable to sinking.[147][148]\n\n\n*Titanic* received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but Captain Smith ignored them.[149] One of the ships to warn *Titanic* was the Atlantic Line's *Mesaba*.[150] Nevertheless, *Titanic* continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time.[151] Although she was not trying to set a speed record,[152] timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed; ice warnings were seen as advisories, and reliance was placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge.[151] It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, SS *Kronprinz Wilhelm*, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still completed her voyage, and Smith said in 1907 that he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"[153][j]\n\n\n\n### Sinking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sinking of *Titanic*\n\n![Drawing of sinking in four steps from eyewitness description](image)\nThe sinking, based on Jack Thayer's description. Sketched by L.P. Skidmore on board *Carpathia*.\n![Photo of an iceberg taken the day after the sinking at the place of sinking](image)\nThe iceberg thought to have been hit by *Titanic*, photographed on the morning of 15 April 1912. Note the dark spot just along the berg's waterline, which was described by onlookers as a smear of red paint.\n![\"Untergang der Titanic\", a painting showing a big ship sinking with survivors in the water and boats](image)\n\"Untergang *der Titanic*\", as conceived by Willy Stöwer, 1912\n\nAt 11:40 pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of *Titanic* and alerted the bridge.[156] First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the iceberg and the engines to be reversed,[157] but it was too late. The starboard side of *Titanic* struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.[k] The hull was not punctured, but rather dented such that its seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that *Titanic* would sink, as she could not remain afloat with more than four compartments flooded. She began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.[159]\n\n\nThose aboard *Titanic* were ill-prepared for such an emergency. In accordance with accepted practices of the time, as ships were seen as largely unsinkable and lifeboats were intended to transfer passengers to nearby rescue vessels,[160][l] *Titanic* only had enough lifeboats to carry about half of those on board; if the ship had carried her full complement of about 3,339 passengers and crew, only about a third could have been accommodated in the lifeboats.[162] The crew had not been trained adequately in carrying out an evacuation. The officers did not know how many they could safely put aboard the lifeboats and launched many of them barely half-full.[163] Third-class passengers were largely left to fend for themselves, causing many of them to become trapped below decks as the ship filled with water.[164] The \"women and children first\" protocol was generally followed when loading the lifeboats,[164] and most of the male passengers and crew were left aboard. Women and children survived at rates of about 75 percent and 50 percent, while only 20 percent of men survived.[165]\n\n\nBetween 2:10 and 2:15 am, a little over two and a half hours after *Titanic* struck the iceberg, her rate of sinking suddenly increased as the boat deck dipped underwater, and the sea poured in through open hatches and grates.[166] As her unsupported stern rose out of the water, exposing the propellers, the ship broke in two main pieces between the second and third funnels, due to the immense forces on the keel. With the bow underwater, and air trapped in the stern, the stern remained afloat and buoyant for a few minutes longer, rising to a nearly vertical angle with hundreds of people still clinging to it,[167] before foundering at 2:20 am.[168] It was believed that *Titanic* sank in one piece, but the discovery of the wreck many years later revealed that she had broken in two. All remaining passengers and crew were immersed in water at a temperature of −2 °C (28 °F). Only five who were in the water were helped into the lifeboats, though the lifeboats had room for almost 500 more people.[169]\n\n\nDistress signals were sent by wireless, rockets, and lamp, but none of the ships that responded were near enough to reach *Titanic* before she sank.[170] A radio operator on board SS *Birma*, for instance, estimated that it would be 6 am before the liner could arrive at the scene. Meanwhile, SS *Californian*, which was the last to have been in contact before the collision, saw *Titanic*'s flares but failed to assist.[171] Around 4 am, RMS *Carpathia* arrived on the scene in response to *Titanic*'s earlier distress calls.[172]\n\n\nWhen the ship sank, the lifeboats that had been lowered were only filled up to an average of 60%.[173] 706 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by *Carpathia* to New York, *Titanic*'s original destination, while 1,517 people died.[106] *Carpathia*'s captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61 m) high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from *Titanic*; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs.[174] This area is now known as Iceberg Alley.[175]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath of sinking[edit]\n\n\n### Immediate aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The New York Times* had gone to press 15 April with knowledge of the collision but not the sinking.[176]\n![](image)\nThe International Mercantile Marine Company's statement on Monday 15 April assured that despite the lack of communication from the ship, it was \"unsinkable\".[177]\n\n![](image)\nLondon newsboy Ned Parfett with news of the disaster, as reported on Tuesday, 16 April\n![](image)\n*Titanic* had been scheduled for a 20 April departure, seen in a *New York Times* ad apparently unable to be pulled, overnight, before this 15 April printing.[178]\n\nRMS *Carpathia* took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.[179] She was, however, able to pass news to the outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confusing, leading the American press to report erroneously on 15 April that *Titanic* was being towed to port by SS *Virginian*.[180] Late on the night of 15 April White Star reported a message received saying *Titanic* had sunk, but all her passengers and crew had been transferred to another vessel.[181] Later that day, confirmation came through that *Titanic* had been lost and that most of her passengers and crew had died.[182] The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices in London, New York, Montreal,[183] Southampton,[184] Liverpool and Belfast.[185] It hit hardest in Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking;[186] four out of every five crew members came from this town.[187][m]\n*Carpathia* docked at 9:30 pm on 18 April at New York's Pier 54 and was greeted by some 40,000 people waiting at the quayside in heavy rain.[190] Immediate relief in the form of clothing and transportation to shelters was provided by the Women's Relief Committee, the Travelers Aid Society of New York, and the Council of Jewish Women, among other organisations.[191] Many of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers did not linger in New York but headed onwards immediately to relatives' homes. Some of the wealthier survivors chartered private trains to take them home, and the Pennsylvania Railroad laid on a special train free of charge to take survivors to Philadelphia. *Titanic*'s 214 surviving crew members were taken to the Red Star Line's steamer SS *Lapland*, where they were accommodated in passenger cabins.[192]\n\n\n*Carpathia* was hurriedly restocked with food and provisions before resuming her journey to Fiume, Austria-Hungary. Her crew were given a bonus of a month's wages by Cunard as a reward for their actions, and some of *Titanic*'s passengers joined to give them an additional bonus of nearly £900 (£113,000 today), divided among the crew members.[193]\n\n\nThe ship's arrival in New York led to a frenzy of press interest, with newspapers competing to be the first to report the survivors' stories. Some reporters bribed their way aboard the pilot boat *New York*, which guided *Carpathia* into harbour, and one even managed to get onto *Carpathia* before she docked.[194] Crowds gathered outside newspaper offices to see the latest reports being posted in the windows or on billboards.[195] It took another four days for a complete list of casualties to be compiled and released, adding to the agony of relatives waiting for news of those who had been aboard *Titanic*.[n]\n\n\n\n### Insurance, aid for survivors and lawsuits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCartoon demanding better safety from shipping companies, 1912\n![](image)\nMolly Brown presenting award to *Carpathia* Captain Arthur Rostron for his service in the rescue\n\nIn January 1912, the hulls and equipment of *Titanic* and *Olympic* had been insured through Lloyd's of London and London Marine Insurance. The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£102,000,000 today) per ship. The policy was to be \"free from all average\" under £150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis Group), was 15 *s* (75 *p*) per £100, or £7,500 (£940,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the White Star Line the full sum owed to them within 30 days.[197]\n\n\nMany charities were set up to help the survivors and their families, many of whom lost their sole wage earner, or, in the case of many Third Class survivors, everything they owned. In New York City, for example, a joint committee of the American Red Cross and Charity Organization Society formed to disburse financial aid to survivors and dependents of those who died.[198] On 29 April, opera stars Enrico Caruso and Mary Garden and members of the Metropolitan Opera raised $12,000 ($300,000 in 2014)[199] in benefits for victims of the disaster by giving special concerts in which versions of \"Autumn\" and \"Nearer My God To Thee\" were part of the programme.[200] In Britain, relief funds were organised for the families of *Titanic*'s lost crew members, raising nearly £450,000 (£56,000,000 today). One such fund was still in operation as late as the 1960s.[201]\n\n\nIn the United States and Britain, more than 60 survivors combined to sue the White Star Line for damages connected to loss of life and baggage.[202] The claims totalled $16,804,112 (appr. $419 million in 2018 USD), which was far in excess of what White Star argued it was responsible for as a limited liability company under American law.[203] Because the bulk of the litigants were in the United States, White Star petitioned the United States Supreme Court in 1914, which ruled in its favour that it qualified as an LLC and found that the causes of the ship's sinking were largely unforeseeable, rather than due to negligence.[204] This sharply limited the scope of damages survivors and family members were entitled to, prompting them to reduce their claims to some $2.5 million. White Star only settled for $664,000 (appr. $16.56 million in 2018), about 27% of the original total sought by survivors. The settlement was agreed to by 44 of the claimants in December 1915, with $500,000 set aside for the American claimants, $50,000 for the British, and $114,000 to go towards interest and legal expenses.[202][203]\n\n\n\n### Investigations into the disaster[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic* and British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)**Senate Inquiry**: within five days of the sinking, *The New York Times* published several columns relating to Ismay's conduct—concerning which \"there has been so much comment\".[205] Columns included the statement of attorney Karl H. Behr indicating Ismay had helped supervise loading of passengers in lifeboats, and of William E. Carter stating that he and Ismay boarded a lifeboat only after there were no more women.[205]\nEven before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had happened, and what could be done to prevent a recurrence. Inquiries were held in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of the failures involved, and the latter broadly more technical and expert-orientated.[206]\n\n\nThe US Senate's inquiry into the disaster was initiated on 19 April, a day after *Carpathia* arrived in New York.[207] The chairman, Senator William Alden Smith, wanted to gather accounts from passengers and crew while the events were still fresh in their minds. Smith also needed to subpoena all surviving British passengers and crew while they were still on American soil, which prevented them from returning to the UK before the American inquiry was completed on 25 May.[208] The British press condemned Smith as an opportunist, insensitively forcing an inquiry as a means of gaining political prestige and seizing \"his moment to stand on the world stage\". Smith, however, already had a reputation as a campaigner for safety on US railroads, and wanted to investigate any possible malpractices by railroad tycoon J. P. Morgan, *Titanic*'s ultimate owner.[209]\n\n\nThe British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster was headed by Lord Mersey, and took place between 2 May and 3 July. Being run by the Board of Trade, who had previously approved the ship, it was seen by some[*like whom?*] as having little interest in its own or White Star's conduct being found negligent.[210]\n\n\nEach inquiry took testimony from both passengers and crew of *Titanic*, crew members of Leyland Line's *Californian*, Captain Arthur Rostron of *Carpathia* and other experts.[211] The British inquiry also took far greater expert testimony, making it the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time.[212] The two inquiries reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate,[213] Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings,[214] the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed, and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a dangerous area at too high a speed.[213]\n\n\nNeither inquiry's findings listed negligence by IMM or the White Star Line as a factor. The American inquiry concluded that since those involved had followed standard practice, the disaster was an act of God.[215] The British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice that had not previously been shown to be unsafe,[216] noting that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 10 lives,[217] and concluded that Smith had done \"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position\". Lord Mersey did, however, find fault with the \"extremely high speed (twenty-two knots) which was maintained\" following numerous ice warnings,[218] noting that \"what was a mistake in the case of the *Titanic* would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future\".[216]\n\n\nThe recommendations included strong suggestions for major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that wireless equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock.[219] An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea; both measures are still in force today.[220]\n\n\nOn 18 June 1912, Guglielmo Marconi gave evidence to the Court of Inquiry regarding the telegraphy. Its final report recommended that all liners carry the system and that sufficient operators maintain a constant service.[221]\n\n\nThe way in which the *Titanic* sank brought to light serious design issues with the *Olympic*-class. This resulted in the *Olympic* receiving a major refit and major design changes for the construction of the *Britannic*.[222]\n\n\nIn August 1912, the liner *Corsican* also struck an iceberg in the Atlantic, severely damaging her bow; however due to the weather being hazy at the time, her speed had been reduced to 'dead slow', so limiting further damage. Although the lifeboats had been swung out, they were not boarded.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Role of SS *Californian*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)SS *Californian*, which had tried to warn *Titanic* of the danger from pack-ice\nOne of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by SS *Californian*, which had been only a few miles from *Titanic* but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to her signal rockets. *Californian* had stopped for the night because of icy conditions and warned *Titanic* by radio, but was rebuked by *Titanic*'s senior wireless operator, Jack Phillips.[224]\n\n\nTestimony before the British inquiry revealed that at 10:10 pm, *Californian* observed the lights of a ship to the south; it was later agreed between Captain Stanley Lord and Third Officer C.V. Groves (who had relieved Lord of duty at 11:10 pm) that this was a passenger liner.[224] At 11:50 pm, the officer had watched that ship's lights flash out, as if she had shut down or turned sharply, and that the port light was now visible.[224] Morse light signals to the ship, upon Lord's order, were made between 11:30 pm and 1:00 am, but were not acknowledged.[225] If *Titanic* was as far from the *Californian* as Lord claimed, then he knew, or should have known, that Morse signals would not be visible. A reasonable and prudent course of action would have been to awaken the wireless operator and to instruct him to attempt to contact *Titanic* by that method. Had Lord done so, it is possible he could have reached *Titanic* in time to save additional lives.[75]\n\n\nCaptain Lord had gone to the chartroom at 11:00 pm to spend the night;[226] however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10 am that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said that he did not know and that the rockets were all white.[*clarification needed*] Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and went back to sleep. Three more rockets were observed at 1:50 am and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15 am, Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.[227]\n\n\n*Californian* eventually responded. At around 5:30 am, Chief Officer George Stewart awakened wireless operator Cyril Furmstone Evans, informed him that rockets had been seen during the night, and asked that he try to communicate with any ship. He got news of *Titanic*'s loss, Captain Lord was notified, and the ship set out to render assistance. She arrived well after *Carpathia* had already picked up all the survivors.[228]\n\n\nThe inquiries found that the ship seen by *Californian* was in fact *Titanic* and that it would have been possible for *Californian* to come to her rescue; therefore, Captain Lord had acted improperly in failing to do so.[229][o]\n\n\n\n### Survivors and victims[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Passengers of the *Titanic*\n\nThe number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, because of a number of factors. These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists.[231] The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people.[232] The tables below use figures from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.[106] While the use of the Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to *Titanic* before it sank, the use of wireless did bring *Carpathia* in time to rescue some of the survivors who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.[50]\n\n\nThe water temperature was well below normal in the area where *Titanic* sank. It also contributed to the rapid death of many passengers during the sinking. Water temperature readings taken around the time of the accident were reported to be −2 °C (28 °F). Typical water temperatures were normally around 7 °C (45 °F) during mid-April.[233] The coldness of the water was a critical factor, often causing death within minutes for many of those in the water.\n\n\nFewer than a third of those aboard *Titanic* survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard *Carpathia*.[234] The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard *Titanic*. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class.[235] In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\n\nThomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[236]\n\n\nThe last living survivor, Millvina Dean from England, who, at only nine weeks old, was the youngest passenger on board, died aged 97 on 31 May 2009.[237] Two special survivors were the stewardess Violet Jessop and the stoker Arthur John Priest,[238] who survived the sinkings of both *Titanic* and HMHS *Britannic* and were aboard RMS *Olympic* when she was rammed in 1911.[239][240][241]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age/sex\n | Class/crew\n | Number aboard\n | Number saved\n | Number lost\n | Percentage saved\n | Percentage lost\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Children\n | First Class\n | 6\n | 5\n | 1\n | 83%\n | 17%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 24\n | 24\n | 0\n | 100%\n | 0%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 79\n | 27\n | 52\n | 34%\n | 66%\n |\n| Women\n | First Class\n | 144\n | 140\n | 4\n | 97%\n | 3%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 93\n | 80\n | 13\n | 86%\n | 14%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 165\n | 76\n | 89\n | 46%\n | 54%\n |\n| Crew\n | 23\n | 20\n | 3\n | 87%\n | 13%\n |\n| Men\n | First Class\n | 175\n | 57\n | 118\n | 33%\n | 67%\n |\n| Second Class\n | 168\n | 14\n | 154\n | 8%\n | 92%\n |\n| Third Class\n | 462\n | 75\n | 387\n | 16%\n | 84%\n |\n| Crew\n | 885\n | 192\n | 693\n | 22%\n | 78%\n |\n| Total\n | 2,224\n | 710\n | 1,514\n | 32%\n | 68%\n |\n\n\n### Retrieval and burial of the dead[edit]\n\n\n![Photograph](image)Markers of *Titanic* victims, Fairview Cemetery, Halifax, Nova Scotia\nOnce the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship CS *Mackay-Bennett* from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to retrieve bodies.[242] Three other Canadian ships followed in the search: the cable ship *Minia*,[243] lighthouse supply ship *Montmagny* and sealing vessel *Algerine*.[244] Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually recovered, 328 were retrieved by the Canadian ships and five more by passing North Atlantic steamships.[245][p]\n\n\nThe first ship to reach the site of the sinking, the CS *Mackay-Bennett*, found so many bodies that the embalming supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations required that only embalmed bodies could be returned to port.[247] Captain Larnder of the *Mackay-Bennett* and undertakers aboard decided to preserve only the bodies of first-class passengers, justifying their decision by the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, many third-class passengers and crew were buried at sea. Larnder identified many of those buried at sea as crew members by their clothing, and stated that as a mariner, he himself would be contented to be buried at sea.[248]\n\n\nBodies recovered were preserved for transport to Halifax, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. The Halifax Registrar of Vital Statistics, John Henry Barnstead, developed a detailed system to identify bodies and safeguard personal possessions. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim bodies. A large temporary morgue was set up in the curling rink of the Mayflower Curling Club and undertakers were called in from all across eastern Canada to assist.[248] Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds of the bodies were identified. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered. The majority of recovered victims, 150 bodies, were buried in three Halifax cemeteries, the largest being Fairview Lawn Cemetery followed by the nearby Mount Olivet and Baron de Hirsch cemeteries.[249]\n\n\nIn mid-May 1912, RMS *Oceanic* recovered three bodies over 200 miles (320 km) from the site of the sinking who were among the original occupants of Collapsible A. When Fifth Officer Harold Lowe and six crewmen returned to the wreck site sometime after the sinking in a lifeboat to pick up survivors, they rescued a dozen males and one female from Collapsible A, but left the dead bodies of three of its occupants.[q] After their retrieval from Collapsible A by *Oceanic*, the bodies were buried at sea.[250]\n\n\nThe last *Titanic* body recovered was steward James McGrady, Body No. 330, found by the chartered Newfoundland sealing vessel *Algerine* on 22 May and buried at Fairview Lawn Cemetery in Halifax on 12 June.[251]\n\n\nOnly 333 bodies of *Titanic* victims were recovered, which amounted to one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles, making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.[252]\n\n\nBodies of passengers of the Titanic were numbered as they were brought aboard. Physical characteristics, clothing, identifying marks, and personal effects were all documented. Personal effects were stored separately, labeled with the same body number, and valuables were locked up by the purser. Without enough material or space to handle bodies and their belongings, the crew had to triage. [253]\n\n\n\n## Wreck[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wreck of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)The bow of *Titanic*, photographed in June 2004\n*Titanic* was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[254] The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding and reaching a wreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700 m) below the surface, where the water pressure is over 6,000 pounds per square inch (40 megapascals),[*dubious – discuss*] about 400 standard atmospheres. A number of expeditions were mounted to find *Titanic* but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard succeeded.[255][256][257]\n\n\nThe team discovered that *Titanic* had in fact split apart, probably near or at the surface, before sinking to the seabed. The separated bow and stern sections lie about a third of a mile (0.6 km) apart in Titanic Canyon off the coast of Newfoundland. They are located 13.2 miles (21.2 km) from the inaccurate coordinates given by *Titanic*'s radio operators on the night of her sinking,[258] and approximately 715 miles (1,151 km) from Halifax and 1,250 miles (2,012 km) from New York.\n\n\nBoth sections struck the seabed at considerable speed, causing the bow to crumple and the stern to collapse entirely. The bow is by far the more intact section and still contains some surprisingly intact interiors. In contrast, the stern is completely wrecked; its decks have pancaked down on top of each other and much of the hull plating was torn off and lies scattered across the sea floor. The much greater level of damage to the stern is probably due to structural damage incurred during the sinking. Thus weakened, the remainder of the stern was flattened by the impact with the sea bed.[259]\n\n\nThe two sections are surrounded by a debris field measuring approximately 5 by 3 miles (8 km × 5 km).[260] It contains hundreds of thousands of items, such as pieces of the ship, furniture, dinnerware and personal items, which fell from the ship as she sank or were ejected when the bow and stern impacted on the sea floor.[261] The debris field was also the last resting place of a number of *Titanic*'s victims. Most of the bodies and clothes were consumed by sea creatures and bacteria, leaving pairs of shoes and boots—which have proved to be inedible—as the only sign that bodies once lay there.[262]\n\n\nSince its initial discovery, the wreck of *Titanic* has been revisited on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating rate of growth of iron-eating bacteria on the hull.[263] In 2006, it was estimated that within 50 years the hull and structure of *Titanic* would eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled with a pile of rust on the sea floor.[264]\n\n\n\n![](image)The ship's bell, recovered from the wreck\nMany artefacts from *Titanic* have been recovered from the seabed by RMS Titanic Inc., which exhibits them in touring exhibitions around the world and in a permanent exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.[265] A number of other museums exhibit artefacts either donated by survivors or retrieved from the floating bodies of victims of the disaster.[266]\n\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the day after the 100th anniversary of the sinking, photos[267] were released showing possible human remains resting on the ocean floor. The photos, taken by Robert Ballard during an expedition led by NOAA in 2004, show a boot and a coat close to *Titanic*'s stern which experts called \"compelling evidence\" that it is the spot where somebody came to rest, and that human remains could be buried in the sediment beneath them.[268] The wreck of the *Titanic* falls under the scope of the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This means that all states party to the convention will prohibit the pillaging, commercial exploitation, sale and dispersion of the wreck and its artefacts. Because of the location of the wreck in international waters and the lack of any exclusive jurisdiction over the wreckage area, the convention provides a state co-operation system, by which states inform each other of any potential activity concerning ancient shipwreck sites, like the *Titanic*, and co-operate to prevent unscientific or unethical interventions.[269][270][271]\n\n\nSubmersible dives in 2019 have found further deterioration of the wreck, including loss of the captain's bathtub.[272] Between 29 July and 4 August 2019, a two-person submersible vehicle that was conducting research and filming a documentary crashed into the wreck. EYOS Expeditions executed the dives. It reported that the strong currents pushed the submersible into the wreck, leaving a red rust stain on the submersible's side. The report did not mention if the *Titanic* sustained damage.[273]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Magellan Ltd., a deep-water seabed-mapping company, announced that they had created a \"digital twin\" of the *Titanic*, showing the wreckage in a level of detail that had never been captured before. The company created the model from some 715,000 3D images, captured over the course of a six-week expedition in the summer of 2022, using two submersibles, named *Romeo* and *Juliet*. They mapped \"every millimetre\" of the wreckage as well as the entire three-nautical-mile (5.6 km) debris field. Creating the model took about eight months.[274][275]\n\n\nOn 18 June 2023, the submersible *Titan*, operated by OceanGate Expeditions, went missing in the North Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Newfoundland. The submersible, designed to carry five people, was carrying an expedition of tourists to view the wreckage of the *Titanic*.[276][277] On 22 June 2023, the operating company announced that they believe the *Titan* crew were lost at sea after a catastrophic implosion of the submersible,[278] and, six days later, the U.S. Coast Guard announced its discovery of “presumed human remains” consistent with such an implosion found within recovered remnants of the *Titan*.[279]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the *Titanic*\n\n![](image)An ice patrol aircraft inspecting an iceberg\nAfter the disaster, recommendations were made by both the British and American Boards of Inquiry stating that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented, lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914.[280] The convention has been updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.[281] Signatories to the Convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example, in Britain, new \"Rules for Life Saving Appliances\" were passed by the Board of Trade on 8 May 1914 and then applied at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.[282]\n\n\nFurther, the United States government passed the Radio Act of 1912. This Act, along with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, stated that radio communications on passenger ships would be operated 24 hours a day, along with a secondary power supply, so as not to miss distress calls. Also, the Radio Act of 1912 required ships to maintain contact with vessels in their vicinity as well as coastal onshore radio stations.[283] In addition, it was agreed in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea that the firing of red rockets from a ship must be interpreted as a sign of need for help. Once the Radio Act of 1912 was passed, it was agreed that rockets at sea would be interpreted as distress signals only, thus removing any possible misinterpretation from other ships.[283] In the same year, the Board of Trade chartered the barque *Scotia* to act as a weather ship in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, keeping a look-out for icebergs. A Marconi wireless telegraph was installed to enable her to communicate with stations on the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland.[284][285]\n\n\nFinally, the disaster led to the formation and international funding of the International Ice Patrol, an agency of the U.S. Coast Guard that to the present day monitors and reports on the location of North Atlantic Ocean icebergs that could pose a threat to transatlantic sea traffic. Coast Guard aircraft conduct the primary reconnaissance. In addition, information is collected from ships operating in or passing through the ice area. Except for the years of the two World Wars, the International Ice Patrol has worked each season since 1913. During the period, there has not been a single reported loss of life or property due to collision with an iceberg in the patrol area.[286]\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural legacy of *Titanic*\n\n![](image)*Titanic* Belfast, photographed in November 2017\n*Titanic* has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.[r] For more than 100 years, she has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge numbers[287] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[288] and even black mourning teddy bears.[289] The sinking inspired many ballads such as \"The Titanic\".[290] Several survivors wrote books about their experiences,[291] but it was not until 1955 that the first historically accurate book – *A Night to Remember* – was published.[292]\n\n\nThe first film about the disaster, *Saved from the Titanic*, was released only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star—the silent film actress Dorothy Gibson. This film is considered lost.[293] The British film *A Night to Remember* (1958) is still widely regarded as the most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking.[294] The most financially successful by far has been James Cameron's *Titanic* (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time,[295] as well as the winner of 11 Oscars at the 70th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron.[296]\n\n\nThe *Titanic* disaster was commemorated through a variety of memorials and monuments to the victims, erected in several English-speaking countries and in particular in cities that had suffered notable losses. These included Southampton and Liverpool in England; New York and Washington, D.C. in the United States; and Belfast and Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Ireland.[297] A number of museums around the world have displays on *Titanic*; the most prominent is in Belfast, the ship's birthplace (see below). \n\n\nRMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent *Titanic* exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Nevada which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull. It also runs an exhibition which travels around the world.[298] In Nova Scotia, Halifax's Maritime Museum of the Atlantic displays items that were recovered from the sea a few days after the disaster. They include pieces of woodwork such as panelling from the ship's First Class Lounge and an original deckchair,[299] as well as objects removed from the victims.[300] In 2012 the centenary was marked by plays, radio programmes, parades, exhibitions and special trips to the site of the sinking together with commemorative stamps and coins.[186][301][302][303][304] Royal Mail (whose mail was carried by RMS (Royal Mail Ship) *Titanic*) issued ten 1st class UK postage stamps, each with the \"crown seal\", to mark the centenary of the disaster.[305]\n\n\nIn a frequently commented-on literary coincidence, Morgan Robertson authored a novel called *Futility* in 1898 about a fictional British passenger liner with the plot bearing a number of similarities to the *Titanic* disaster. In the novel, the ship is SS *Titan*, a four-stacked liner, the largest in the world and considered unsinkable; like the *Titanic*, she sinks in April after hitting an iceberg and does not have enough lifeboats.[306]\n\n\n\n#### In Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nIt took many decades before the significance of *Titanic* was promoted in Northern Ireland, where it was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. While the rest of the world embraced the glory and tragedy of *Titanic*, it remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th century in its birth city. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to Belfast's pride. Its shipyard was also a place many Catholics regarded as hostile.[307] In the latter half of the century, during a 30-year sectarian conflict, *Titanic* was a reminder of the lack of civil rights that in part contributed towards the Troubles. While the fate of *Titanic* remained a well-known story within local households throughout the 20th century, commercial investment in projects recalling RMS *Titanic*'s legacy was modest because of these issues.[308]\n\n\nAfter the Troubles and Good Friday Agreement, the number of overseas tourists visiting Northern Ireland increased.[309] It was subsequently identified in the Northern Ireland Tourism Board's *Strategic Framework for Action 2004–2007* that the significance of and interest in *Titanic* globally (partly due to the 1997 film *Titanic*) was not being fully exploited as a tourist attraction.[310] Thus, *Titanic* Belfast was spearheaded, along with some smaller projects, such as a *Titanic* memorial.[311]\n\n\nIn 2012 on the ship's centenary, the *Titanic* Belfast visitor attraction was opened on the site of the shipyard where *Titanic* was built.[312] It was Northern Ireland's second most visited tourist attraction with almost 700,000 visitors in 2016.[313]\n\n\nDespite over 1,600 ships being built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast Harbour, Queen's Island became renamed after its most famous ship, Titanic Quarter in 1995. Once a sensitive story, *Titanic* is now considered one of Northern Ireland's most revered and uniting symbols.[314][*failed verification*]\n\n\nIn late August 2018, several groups were vying for the right to purchase the 5,500 *Titanic* relics that were an asset of the bankrupt Premier Exhibitions.[315] Eventually, *Titanic* Belfast, Titanic Foundation Limited and the National Museums Northern Ireland joined with the National Maritime Museum as a consortium that was raising money to purchase the 5,500 artefacts. The group intended to keep all of the items together as a single exhibit. Oceanographer Robert Ballard said he favoured this bid since it would ensure that the memorabilia would be permanently displayed in Belfast (where *Titanic* was built) and in Greenwich.[315] The museums were critical of the bid process set by the Bankruptcy court in Jacksonville, Florida. The minimum bid for the 11 October 2018 auction was set at US$21.5 million (£16.5m) and the consortium did not have enough funding to meet that amount.[316][317] On 17 October 2018, *The New York Times* reported that a consortium of three hedge funds—Apollo Global Management, Alta Fundamental Advisers, and PacBridge Capital Partners—had paid US$19.5 million for the collection.[318] At the time of the purchase, the consortium agreed to continued oversight by the court concerning new exploration or salvage expedition must receive approval from NOAA and the court. Further, the purchase price gives Premier's unsecured creditors an 80% recovery.\n\n\n\n## Appendix[edit]\n\n\nDiagrams of RMS *Titanic*\nDiagram of RMS *Titanic* showing the arrangement of the bulkheads in red.

A project by South African businessman Sarel Gaus was abandoned in 2006, and a project by Australian businessman Clive Palmer was announced in 2012, known as the *Titanic II*.\n\n\nA Chinese shipbuilding company known as Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co., Ltd commenced construction in November 2016 to build a replica ship of the *Titanic* for use in a resort. The vessel was to house many features of the original, such as a ballroom, dining hall, theatre, first-class cabins, economy cabins and swimming pool.[326][327] Tourists were to be able to reside inside the *Titanic* during their time at the resort. It was to be permanently docked at the resort and feature an audiovisual simulation of the sinking, which has caused some criticism.[328] As of 2022, however, it was reportedly only 25% complete,[329] and its website and Twitter account are offline.\n\n\nRMS *Olympic* was the sister ship of the *Titanic*. The interior decoration of the dining salon and the grand staircase were in identical style and created by the same craftsmen. Large parts of the interior of the *Olympic* were later sold and are now in the White Swan Hotel, Alnwick, which gives an impression of how the interior of the *Titanic* looked.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Transport portal\n* ![icon](image)Oceans portal\n* ![flag](image)United Kingdom portal\n\n\n* *Titanic* conspiracy theories\n* *Titanic* in popular culture\n* Seamen's Act\n* Lists of shipwrecks\n* *The Wreck of the Titan: Or, Futility*\n\n\n### Comparable disasters[edit]\n\n\n* SS *Atlantic*, White Star Line ship lost in 1873 with the greatest loss of life for the company before *Titanic*\n* SS *Eastland*, a ship capsizing in 1915 after being fitted with extra lifeboats\n* MS *Estonia*\n* RMS *Empress of Ireland*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The death toll of the sinking of *Tek Sing* in 1822 is not known exactly, but it may have exceeded that of *Titanic*.\n2. **^** Carlisle would leave the project in 1910, before the ships were launched, when he became a shareholder in Welin Davit & Engineering Company Ltd, the firm making the ship's davits.[12] Wilding was sacked following the *Titanic* disaster, having been unfairly blamed by Pirrie for the ship's loss.[13]\n3. **^** It was kept off-limits to passengers; the famous \"flying\" scene at the ship's bow from the 1997 film *Titanic* would not have been permitted in real life.\n4. **^** Copy of the neoclassical oil painting by Merry-Joseph Blondel[63]\n5. **^** Measurement of lifeboats: **1–2:** 25'2\" long by 7'2\" wide by 3'2\" deep; 326.6 cubic feet (9.25 m3); **3–16:** 30' long by 9'1\" wide by 4' deep; 655.2 cubic feet (18.55 m3) and **A–D:** 27'5\" long by 8' wide by 3' deep; 376.6 cubic feet (10.66 m3)\n6. **^** Since 1894, when the largest passenger ship under consideration was the Cunard Line's 13,000-ton *Lucania*, the Board of Trade had made no provision to increase the existing scale regarding the number of required lifeboats for larger ships, such as the 46,000-ton *Titanic*. Sir Alfred Chalmers, nautical adviser to the Board of Trade from 1896 to 1911, had considered the matter of adjusting the scale \"from time to time\", but because he not only assumed that experienced sailors would need to be carried \"uselessly\" aboard ship only to lower and man the extra lifeboats, but also anticipated the difficulty in getting away a greater number than 16 boats in any emergency, he \"did not consider it necessary to increase [the scale]\".[74]\n7. **^** He expressed deep disappointment about the decision before the voyage but was presumably greatly relieved afterwards.[110]\n8. **^** *Titanic* also had a ship's cat, Jenny, who gave birth to a litter of kittens shortly before the ship's maiden voyage; all perished in the sinking.[114]\n9. **^** Known afterward as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\" due to her efforts in helping other passengers while the ship sank.\n10. **^** Captain Edward Smith had been in command of *Titanic*'s sister *Olympic* when she in 1911 collided with a warship. Even though that ship was designed to sink others by ramming them, it suffered greater damage than *Olympic*, thereby strengthening the image of the class being unsinkable.[154][155]\n11. **^** The official enquiry found that damage extended about 300 feet, but both Edward Wilding's testimony and modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck suggest the total area was perhaps a few narrow openings totalling perhaps no more than 12 to 13 square feet (1.1 to 1.2 m2).[158][82]\n12. **^** An incident confirmed this philosophy while *Titanic* was under construction: the White Star liner *Republic* was involved in a collision and sank. Even though she did not have enough lifeboats for all passengers, they were all saved because the ship was able to stay afloat long enough for them to be ferried to ships coming to assist.[161]\n13. **^** The Salvation Army newspaper, *The War Cry*, reported that \"none but a heart of stone would be unmoved in the presence of such anguish. Night and day that crowd of pale, anxious faces had been waiting patiently for the news that did not come. Nearly every one in the crowd had lost a relative.\"[188] It was not until 17 April that the first incomplete lists of survivors came through, delayed by poor communications.[189]\n14. **^** On 23 April, the *Daily Mail* reported: \"Late in the afternoon hope died out. The waiting crowds thinned, and silent men and women sought their homes. In the humbler homes of Southampton there is scarcely a family who has not lost a relative or friend. Children returning from school appreciated something of tragedy, and woeful little faces were turned to the darkened, fatherless homes.\"[196]\n15. **^**  Lord protested his innocence to the end of his life, and many researchers have asserted that the known positions of *Titanic* and *Californian* make it impossible that the former was the infamous \"mystery ship\", a topic which has \"generated ... millions of words and ... hours of heated debates\" and continues to do so.[230]\n16. **^** Most of the bodies were numbered; however, the five passengers buried at sea by *Carpathia* went unnumbered.[246]\n17. **^** Thomson Beattie, a first class passenger, and two crew members, a fireman and a seaman.\n18. **^** An example is Daniel Butler's book about RMS *Titanic*, titled *Unsinkable*.\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Ship's time; at the time of the collision, *Titanic*'s clocks were set to 2 hours 2 minutes ahead of Eastern Time Zone and 2 hours 58 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time.[324]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Titanic History, Facts and Stories\". *Titanic Museum Belfast*.

The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] *Star Wars* is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\nThe original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope*, was followed by the sequels *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi* (1983), forming the original *Star Wars* trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode I: The Phantom Menace* (1999), *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* (2002), and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode VII: The Force Awakens* (2015), *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* (2017), and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019).\n\n\nAll nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films *Rogue One* (2016) and *Solo* (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, making *Star Wars* the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\"[3] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle.[4] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[5][6][7] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a *Star Wars* planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[8] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[9][10] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[11][12][13] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.[14]\n\n\nThe universe of *Star Wars* is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[15] One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together\".[16] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[17] Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[18] It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[19] The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[20][21] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[22]\n\n\nThe franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires, such as the evil Galactic Empire.[23] The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts.[24] The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms.[25] In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.[26] Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.[26]\n\n\nThe combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes *Star Wars* a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.[27]\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars films\n\n### The Skywalker Saga[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Original trilogy: Episodes IV–VI\n |\n| *Star Wars* | May 25, 1977 (1977-05-25) | George Lucas | Gary Kurtz | [28][29] |\n| *The Empire Strikes Back* | May 21, 1980 (1980-05-21) | Irvin Kershner | Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan | George Lucas\n | [30][31] |\n| *Return of the Jedi* | May 25, 1983 (1983-05-25) | Richard Marquand | Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas\n | Howard Kazanjian | [32][33] |\n| Prequel trilogy: Episodes I–III\n |\n| *The Phantom Menace* | May 19, 1999 (1999-05-19) | George Lucas | George Lucas\n | George Lucas\n | Rick McCallum | [34] |\n| *Attack of the Clones* | May 16, 2002 (2002-05-16) | George Lucas and Jonathan Hales | [35][36] |\n| *Revenge of the Sith* | May 19, 2005 (2005-05-19) | George Lucas\n | [37][38] |\n| Sequel trilogy: Episodes VII–IX\n |\n| *The Force Awakens* | December 18, 2015 (2015-12-18) | J.

Abrams and Michelle Rejwan | [42][43] |\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\".[44] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning *in media res* with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983. This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.[45]\n\n\nEach trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith lord Palpatine (Darth Sidious).[46] The original trilogy depicts the heroic development of Luke Skywalker as a Jedi and his fight against Palpatine's Galactic Empire alongside his sister, Leia.[47] The prequels tell the tragic backstory of their father, Anakin, who is corrupted by Palpatine and becomes Darth Vader.[48] The sequels feature Leia's son, Ben Solo, and Luke and Leia's protegé, Rey, thirty years after the fall of the Empire.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Original trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars original trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader's voice).\n\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the *Flash Gordon* serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.[50][c] After directing *American Graffiti* (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.[51][52] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.[53] Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost.[54]\n\n\n*Star Wars* was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope* in the 1979 book *The Art of Star Wars*.[55] The film's success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.[56] With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies.[57] *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi*, was released on May 25, 1983.\n\n\n\n#### Prequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars prequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padmé Amidala), Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker),[d] and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine).\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.[58] In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,[59] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.[60] In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\"[61]\n\n\nTechnical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be \"unbelievably expensive\".[62] In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.[63] A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 \"updated\" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.[64]\n\n\n*Episode I: The Phantom Menace* was released on May 19, 1999, *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* on May 16, 2002, and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* on May 19, 2005.[65] The first two films were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as \"the tragedy of Darth Vader\".[66]\n\n\n\n#### Sequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars sequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).\n\nPrior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\".[57][67] However, he announced to *Time* in 1978 that he planned \"10 sequels\".[68] He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981.[69] At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic,[70] the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy),[67] Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia),[58] Han, Leia,[71] R2-D2 and C-3PO.[57][72] However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that *Star Wars* was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.[73][74]\n\n\nLucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more *Star Wars* films.[75] That October, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that *Episode VII* would be released in 2015.[76] The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president and served as executive producer of new *Star Wars* feature films.[77] Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,[78] but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.[79][80] The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the *Star Wars* Expanded Universe stories, which were discarded from canon to give \"maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.\"[2]\n\n\n*Episode VII: The Force Awakens* was released on December 16, 2015, *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* on December 13, 2017, and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* on December 18, 2019, in many countries.[e] *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi* were both critical and box office successes.[81][82] *Episode IX* received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.[83]\n\n\n\n### Standalone films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story* | December 16, 2016 (2016-12-16) | Gareth Edwards | Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy | John Knoll and Gary Whitta | Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur and Simon Emanuel\n | [84] |\n| *Solo: A Star Wars Story* | May 25, 2018 (2018-05-25) | Ron Howard | Jonathan Kasdan & Lawrence Kasdan\n | [85] |\n\n\nSeveral *Star Wars* films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga. In 2008, Lucasfilm released the animated film *The Clone Wars*, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name.[86] Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an \"anthology\" film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy,[87] described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe anthology films' main casts include (from left to right) Felicity Jones (Jyn Erso) and Diego Luna (Cassian Andor) from *Rogue One* and Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) and Woody Harrelson (Tobias Beckett) from *Solo*.\n\nThe first film released was *Rogue One* in 2016, which tells the story of the rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star, the Galactic Empire's superweapon, just before the events of the original *Star Wars* film.[89][90] A second film, *Solo*, was released in 2018 and tells the backstory of original trilogy character Han Solo several years prior to the original *Star Wars* film.[91] The television series *Obi-Wan Kenobi* was originally planned as a film, but changed to a limited series due to *Solo* underperforming at the box office.[92]\n\n\n\n### Upcoming films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Status\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Untitled *New Jedi Order* film\n | TBA\n | Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy | Steven Knight | Kathleen Kennedy\n | In development\n | [93] |\n| Untitled *Dawn of the Jedi* film\n | James Mangold | [93] |\n| Untitled *New Republic* film\n | Dave Filoni | [93] |\n\n\nIn April 2023, three new *Star Wars* films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise.[94] An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the \"dawn of the Jedi\".[94] Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with *The Mandalorian* in 2019.[94] Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy.[93][95]\n\n\n\n#### Other potential projects[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm has a number of *Star Wars* films in various stages of development, including: \n\n\n\n* **Untitled Rian Johnson trilogy**: In November 2017, a trilogy of movies written by *The Last Jedi* writer/director Rian Johnson was announced to be in development.[96][97] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that trilogy of films is still in open development at the studio, with the writer/director working on the story, although it is not currently a priority.[98]\n* **Untitled David Benioff & D.B. Weiss trilogy**: In February 2018, it was announced that David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would serve as writers and producers on a trilogy of new *Star Wars* movies.[99] The plot would take place chronologically before the Prequel Trilogy, and center around the origin of the Jedi.[100] By May 2019, the duo were also slated to serve as co-directors of the first installment in their three films.[101] In October of the same year however, the filmmaking duo exited development of the projects due to scheduling conflicts with projects they are developing for Netflix. Kennedy stated that the studio is open to working with the duo, and developing their films once their schedule allows it.[102]\n* **Untitled Taika Waititi film**: In May 2020, Taika Waititi signed onto the project which was stated to be the first priority for the studio, with the filmmaker Waititi serving as director from a script he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.[103] In May 2022, the movie was named as the next *Star Wars* film to begin production ahead of *Rogue Squadron*, with Kennedy stating that the studio was tentatively looking towards late 2023 for a debut, but had not yet officially set a release date.[104][105] By April 2023, she stated that the project is still in development, with Waititi continuing to work on the script.[106][98]\n* ***Rogue Squadron***: An anthology film, following the events of *Rogue One*, will be directed by Patty Jenkins with a script written by Matthew Robinson.[107] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that the script is still in development, with the studio considering changing the project into a television series.[108]\n* **Untitled J.D. Dillard film**: In February 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and writer Matt Owens;[109] although, Dillard announced he was no longer to direct that film in November 2022.[110]\n* ***Star Wars: A Droid Story***: In December 2020, an animated film centered around the adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO was announced as being in development; the story will introduce a new heroic character to the franchise, alongside these characters. The project will be a joint-venture production between Lucasfilm Animation, and Industrial Light & Magic. The film is being developed to debut via streaming, exclusively through Disney+.[111][112][113]\n* **Untitled Shawn Levy film**: In November 2022, Shawn Levy entered talks to direct a *Star Wars* film, following his work on *Deadpool 3* (2024) and the fifth and final season of *Stranger Things*.[114]\n* **Untitled Lando film**: A film focused on original trilogy character Lando Calrissian, reported to be written by Donald Glover (who portrayed the character in *Solo*) and Stephen Glover.[115]\n\n\n## Television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars television series\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise includes several live-action series. The first series, *The Mandalorian*, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga.[116] Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including *The Book of Boba Fett*, released in 2021; *Ahsoka*, released in 2023; and the upcoming *Skeleton Crew*.[117][118][119] These series follow the plight of the New Republic and its allies against the remnants of the fallen Galactic Empire.[120]\n\n\nA story focused on Obi-Wan Kenobi, a character from the original *Star Wars* trilogy, was planned as a film before becoming a live-action series after the box office failure of *Solo* in 2018.[92] The series was released on Disney+ in 2022 and is set between the prequel and original trilogy films.[121] It was followed by the live-action series *Andor* in the same year; both series follow their titular characters during the reign of the Empire.[121][122]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Live-action series** |\n| *The Mandalorian* | 3 | 24 | November 12, 2019 – present (2019-11-12 – present) | Disney+ |\n| *The Book of Boba Fett* | 1 | 7 | December 29, 2021 – February 9, 2022 (2021-12-29 – 2022-02-09) |\n| *Obi-Wan Kenobi* | 1 | 6 | May 27 – June 22, 2022 (2022-05-27 – 2022-06-22) |\n| *Andor* | 1 | 12 | September 21, 2022 – present (2022-09-21 – present) |\n| *Ahsoka* | 1 | 8 | August 22 – October 3, 2023 (2023-08-22 – 2023-10-03) |\n| **Game shows** |\n| *Jedi Temple Challenge* | 1 | 10 | June 10 – August 5, 2020 (2020-06-10 – 2020-08-05) | StarWarsKids.com |\n\n### Animated series[edit]\n\n\nThe first two animated series, *Droids* and *Ewoks*, were produced in the 1980s.[123] They were followed by the *Clone Wars* animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon.[2] Subsequent animated series include *Rebels*, released in 2014; *Resistance*, released in 2018; and *The Bad Batch*, released in 2021. \n\n\nSeveral micro-series and shorts have also been released by Lucasfilm since Disney's acquisition, with the earlier animated series falling under Disney's \"Vintage\" collection of *Star Wars* content.[124][125]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Animated series** |\n| *Droids* | 1 | 13 | September 7, 1985 – June 7, 1986 (1985-09-07 – 1986-06-07) | ABC |\n| *Ewoks* | 2 | 26 | September 7, 1985 – December 13, 1986 (1985-09-07 – 1986-12-13) |\n| *The Clone Wars* | 7 | 133 | October 3, 2008 – May 4, 2020 (2008-10-03 – 2020-05-04) | Cartoon Network / Netflix / Disney+ |\n| *Rebels* | 4 | 75 | October 3, 2014 – March 5, 2018 (2014-10-03 – 2018-03-05) | Disney XD |\n| *Resistance* | 2 | 40 | October 7, 2018 – January 26, 2020 (2018-10-07 – 2020-01-26) | Disney Channel |\n| *The Bad Batch* | 2 | 47 | May 4, 2021 – present (2021-05-04 – present) | Disney+ |\n| *Visions* | 2 | 18 | September 22, 2021 – present (2021-09-22 – present) |\n| *Tales of the Jedi* | 1 | TBA | October 26, 2022 – present (2022-10-26 – present) |\n| *Young Jedi Adventures* | 1 | 25 | May 4, 2023 – present (2023-05-04 – present) | Disney+ / Disney Junior |\n| **Animated micro-series and shorts** |\n| *Clone Wars* | 3 | 25 | November 7, 2003 – March 25, 2005 (2003-11-07 – 2005-03-25) | Cartoon Network |\n| *Blips* | 1 | 8 | May 3 – September 4, 2017 (2017-05-03 – 2017-09-04) | YouTube |\n| *Forces of Destiny* | 2 | 32 | July 3, 2017 – May 25, 2018 (2017-07-03 – 2018-05-25) |\n| *Galaxy of Adventures* | 2 | 55 | November 30, 2018 – October 2, 2020 (2018-11-30 – 2020-10-02) |\n| *Roll Out* | 1 | 16 | August 9, 2019 – April 1, 2020 (2019-08-09 – 2020-04-01) |\n| *Galaxy of Creatures* | 2 | 24 | October 14, 2021 – February 21, 2023 (2021-10-14 – 2023-02-21) | StarWarsKids.com |\n| *Galactic Pals* | 1 | 12 | April 12 – November 1, 2022 (2022-04-12 – 2022-11-01) |\n| \"Zen – Grogu and Dust Bunnies\" | Short | 1 | November 12, 2022 (2022-11-12) | Disney+ |\n\n### Films and specials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Teleplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Network\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Star Wars Holiday Special* | November 17, 1978 (1978-11-17) | Steve Binder | Pat Proft, Leonard Ripps, Bruce Vilanch, Rod Warren, and Mitzie Welch\n | Joe Layton, Jeff Starsh, Ken Welch, and Mitzie Welch\n | CBS |\n| *The Ewok Adventure* | November 25, 1984 (1984-11-25) | John Korty | Bob Carrau\n | George Lucas | Thomas G.

A schism within the Jedi leads to the creation of the Sith.[126]\n* The High Republic: Under the protection of the Jedi, the Republic grows into a golden age. This era includes *The High Republic* literary works and the animated series *Young Jedi Adventures*.[126]\n* Fall of the Jedi: The Republic's Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine (secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious), orchestrates the Clone Wars, overthrows the Republic, exterminates the Jedi Order and corrupts Anakin Skywalker.[126][130] This era includes the prequel trilogy films, the beginning of the episodic Skywalker saga, and the animated series *Tales of the Jedi* and *The Clone Wars*.[126]\n* Reign of the Empire: Palpatine's Galactic Empire rules the galaxy and the remaining Jedi are hunted down.[126] This era includes *Solo: A Star Wars Story*, *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, *Andor*, *Rogue One*, the animated series *The Bad Batch* and *Rebels*, and the video games *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor* and *Vader Immortal*.[126]\n* Age of Rebellion: The Rebellion against the Empire spreads across the galaxy, while the Jedi return with the emergence of Luke Skywalker.[126][131] This era includes the original trilogy films[f] and the video games *Star Wars Battlefront II* and *Star Wars: Squadrons*.[126]\n* The New Republic: Following the Empire's defeat, the emergent New Republic attempts to reunite the galaxy, while threatened by the remnants of the Empire.[126] This era includes *The Mandalorian*, *The Book of Boba Fett*, and *Ahsoka*.[126]\n* Rise of the First Order: The remnants of the Empire transform into the First Order but are fought by the Resistance, climaxing with the defeat of Palpatine and the Sith by the Jedi Rey.[126][130] This era includes the sequel trilogy films, the animated series *Star Wars Resistance* and the video game *Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge*.[126]\n* New Jedi Order: Rey builds a new Jedi Order, which will be depicted in an upcoming untitled film.[94][126]\n\n\nThe Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as *Legends* on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, *The Clone Wars* film, and television series.[2]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars in other media\n\nFrom 1976 to 2014, the term *Expanded Universe* (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed *Star Wars* storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.[133] Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the *Star Wars Legends* label,[133] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game *The Old Republic* the only *Legends* material to still be produced. The *Star Wars* canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film *The Clone Wars* (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.[2] Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement.\n\n\n\n### Print media[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of *Star Wars*, initially subtitled \"*From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker*\". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.[134] The first \"Expanded Universe\" story appeared in Marvel Comics' *Star Wars* #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* the following month.\n\n\n\n#### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Star Wars books\n\n![](image)Timothy Zahn authored the *Thrawn* trilogy, which was widely credited with revitalizing the dormant *Star Wars* franchise in the early 1990s.\nAfter penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* (1978). The novelizations of *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) by Donald F. Glut and *Return of the Jedi* (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as *The Han Solo Adventures* trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian Daley,[135] and *The Adventures of Lando Calrissian* trilogy (1983) by L. Neil Smith.[136][137]\n\n\nTimothy Zahn's bestselling *Thrawn* trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.[138][139][140][141] The first novel, *Heir to the Empire*, reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller list,[142] and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.[143] In *The Courtship of Princess Leia* (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the *Thrawn* trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry.[144][145] Steve Perry's *Shadows of the Empire* (1996), set between *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.[146][147] The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.[146][148] Other notable series from Bantam include the *Jedi Academy* trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson,[149][150] the 14-book *Young Jedi Knights* series (1995–1998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta,[150][151] and the *X-wing* series (1996–2012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.[152][153][154]\n\n\nDel Rey took over *Star Wars* book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called *The New Jedi Order* (1999–2003). Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.[155][156] The bestselling multi-author series *Legacy of the Force* (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in *The Force Awakens* with Han and Leia's son Ben Solo, who becomes the evil Kylo Ren.[157][158][159][160]\n\n\nThree series set in the prequel era were published by Scholastic for younger audiences: the 18-book *Jedi Apprentice* (1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before *The Phantom Menace*; the 11-book *Jedi Quest* (2001–2004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between *The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones*; and the 10-book *The Last of the Jedi* (2005–2008), set almost immediately after *Revenge of the Sith*, features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi. In 2019, a new prequel era novel, starring Qui-Gon and the young Obi-Wan, was published by Del Rey under the title *Star Wars: Master and Apprentice*.[161]\n\n\nAlthough Thrawn had been designated a *Legends* character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in 2016 for the third season of the *Rebels* animated series, with Zahn returning to write more novels based on the character and set in the new canon.[162][163]\n\n\n\n#### Comics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Star Wars comics and List of Star Wars comic books\n\nMarvel Comics published a *Star Wars* comic book series from 1977 to 1986.[164][165][166][167] Original *Star Wars* comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine *Pizzazz* between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original *Star Wars* stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the *Star Wars* comic series.[168] From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series *Ewoks* and *Droids* inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.[169][170][171] According to Marvel comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of *Star Wars* comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.[172] Marvel's *Star Wars* series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[173] The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.[174]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new *Star Wars* comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular *Dark Empire* series (1991–1995).[175] Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including *Tales of the Jedi* (1993–1998), *X-wing Rogue Squadron* (1995–1998), *Star Wars: Republic* (1998–2006), *Star Wars Tales* (1999–2005), *Star Wars: Empire* (2002–2006), and *Knights of the Old Republic* (2006–2010).[176][177]\n\n\nAfter Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the *Star Wars* comics license would return to Marvel Comics,[178] whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.[179] Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled *Star Wars*, *Darth Vader*, and the limited series *Princess Leia*.[180][181][182]\n\n\nFirst announced as *Project Luminous* at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, the *Star Wars: The High Republic* publishing initiative were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the then current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga was explored in various books and comics. Including ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively.[183]\n\n\n\n### Audio[edit]\n\n\n#### Soundtracks and singles[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Star Wars\n\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with *The Rise of Skywalker*.[184] He also composed Han Solo's theme for *Solo: A Star Wars Story*; John Powell adapted and composed the rest of the score.[185] Michael Giacchino composed the score of *Rogue One*.[185] Ludwig Göransson scored and composed the music of *The Mandalorian*.[186] Williams also created the main theme for *Galaxy's Edge*.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Audio novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Story of Star Wars and List of Star Wars books\n\nThe first *Star Wars* audio work is *The Story of Star Wars*, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars (radio)\n\nRadio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the *Star Wars* radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.[189][190]\n\n\nThe first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.[191][189][190] Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film roles.[191][189]\n\n\nThe overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of *The Empire Strikes Back* debuted in 1983.[192] Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute *Star Wars* audio drama titled *Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell*, written by Daley.[190][193] In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several *Star Wars* series from Dark Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part *Dark Empire* saga, *Tales of the Jedi*, *Dark Lords of the Sith*, the *Dark Forces* trilogy, and *Crimson Empire* (1998).[193] *Return of the Jedi* was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.[189][193]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars video games and List of Star Wars video games\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise has spawned over one hundred[194] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as *Star Wars Legends* and removed from the canon in 2014). *Star Wars* games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n#### Early licensed games (1979–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe first officially licensed electronic *Star Wars* game was Kenner's 1979 table-top *Star Wars Electronic Battle Command*.[195][196] In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first *Star Wars* video game for the Atari 2600, *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back*,[197] followed soon the year later by *Star Wars: Jedi Arena*, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game *Star Wars*, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.[198] The next game, *Star Wars: Return of the Jedi* (1984), has more traditional raster graphics,[199] while the following *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1985) has vector graphics.[200]\n\n\nPlatform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive *Star Wars* (1987), an international *Star Wars* (1991), and *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1992). *Super Star Wars* (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.\n\n\n\n#### LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LucasArts\n\nLucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released *Star Wars: X-Wing*, the first self-published *Star Wars* video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.[201] It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.[201] The *Rogue Squadron* series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.\n\n\n*Dark Forces* (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,[202] was the first *Star Wars* first-person shooter.[203] It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi.[203][202][204][205] The game was well received,[206][207][208] and it was followed by four sequels.[209][210] The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.[211] Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,[203][212][213] a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.[157] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, *Star Wars Galaxies*, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.[214]\n\n\n\n#### *EA Star Wars* (2014–present)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the *Star Wars* filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game *Jedi Challenges*, released in November 2017.[215][216] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play *Star Wars* mobile games.[217] The *Battlefront* games received a canonical reboot with *Star Wars: Battlefront* in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, *Battlefront II*, in November 2017. A single-player action-adventure game, *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019. A space combat game titled *Star Wars: Squadrons*, which builds upon the space battles from *Battlefront*, was released in October 2020.\n\n\n\n### Theme park attractions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars theme parks attractions\n\nIn addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time *A Galactic Spectacular*.

While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue.[223] By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in merchandising revenue.[224]\n\n\nKenner made the first *Star Wars* action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.[225] *Star Wars* was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.[226] Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their *Star Wars* sets.[227] The Lego *Star Wars* video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.[228][229]\n\n\nIn 1977, the board game *Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star* was released.[230][g] A *Star Wars Monopoly* and themed versions of *Trivial Pursuit* and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. The board game *Risk* has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro: *The Clone Wars Edition* (2005)[232] and the *Original Trilogy Edition* (2006).[233] Three *Star Wars* tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.\n\n\n*Star Wars* Trading Cards have been published since the first \"blue\" series, by Topps, in 1977.[234] Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare \"promos\", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II \"floating Yoda\" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most \"base\" or \"common card\" sets are plentiful, many \"insert\" or \"chase cards\" are very rare.[235] From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the *Star Wars Customizable Card Game*.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\n*Star Wars* features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as \"the shadow\".[236]\nThere are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.[237] Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the \"Chosen One\", a messianic individual. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until *Return of the Jedi*. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is \"doing what he thinks is right\".[238] George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.[239]\n\n\nThe saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[237] Each character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.[240] A defining step of the journey is \"Atonement with the Father\".[241] Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin,[242] whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.[243] Luke's discovery that Vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.[244] Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.[238] Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.[245] According to *Inverse*, the final scene in *The Last Jedi*, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that \"the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings.\"[246]\n\n\n\n### Historical influences[edit]\n\n\nPolitical science has been an important element of *Star Wars* since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.[247][248] Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet.[249][250] Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the *Schutzstaffel* served Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader.[251] Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German \"shock\" troopers. Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II,[252] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War II terms were used for names in the films; *e.g.* the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).[253] Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in *The Empire Strikes Back* resemble tank interiors,[254] and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights.[255]\n\n\nPalpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself *Führer*.[252] Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon.[256][257][h] The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.[259] The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[260][261]\n\n\nOn the inspiration for the First Order formed \"from the ashes of the Empire\", *The Force Awakens* director J. J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and \"started working together again.\"[262]\n\n\n\n* ![The aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.](image)\n\nThe aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.\n* ![The flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.](image)\n\nThe flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe lightsaber and the blaster are iconic elements of the franchise.\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[263] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[264] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon.[265] The first *Star Wars* film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[266] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[267] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[268] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including *Hardware Wars*, *Spaceballs*, *The Family Guy Trilogy* and *Robot Chicken: Star Wars*.\n\n\nIn 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original *Star Wars* film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[269] *The Empire Strikes Back* was selected in 2010,[270][271] and *Return of the Jedi* was selected in 2021.[272] 35 mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[273][274] but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.[275]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.[255] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[276] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, *Star Wars* is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[277][278]\n\n\n*Star Wars* fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before *Star Wars*, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.[279] The commercial success of *Star Wars* created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[276] Along with *Jaws*, *Star Wars* started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[280][267] It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[266]\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book *The Great Movies*, \"Like *The Birth of a Nation* and *Citizen Kane*, *Star Wars* was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.\" It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.[281] Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's *Jaws*, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[255][282][283]\n\n\nSome critics have blamed *Star Wars* and *Jaws* for \"ruining\" Hollywood by shifting its focus from \"sophisticated\" films such as *The Godfather*, *Taxi Driver*, and *Annie Hall* to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[284] One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, \"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.\"[284][285] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through *Star Wars* and *Jaws*, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth\".[283]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[286] Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by *Star Wars*, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,[287] David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,[281] and later *Star Wars* directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.[288] Lucas's concept of a \"used universe\" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's *Blade Runner* (1982) and *Alien* (1979), James Cameron's *Aliens* (1986) as well as *The Terminator* (1984), George Miller's *Mad Max 2* (1981), and Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003).[281] Christopher Nolan cited *Star Wars* as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film *Inception*.[289]\n\n\n\n#### Fan works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars fan films\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the *Star Wars* galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official *Star Wars* Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the *Star Wars* universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[290] Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.[291]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.[292] Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.[293] Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S. have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.[294][295]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![icon](image)Science fiction portal\n\n\n* 501st Legion\n* Architecture of *Star Wars*\n* Comparison of Star Trek and Star Wars\n* Jedi census phenomenon\n* Jediism\n* List of space science fiction franchises\n* List of *Star Wars* characters\n* List of *Star Wars* creatures\n* List of *Star Wars* planets and moons\n* Music of *Star Wars*\n* Physics and *Star Wars*\n* Star Wars Celebration\n* *Star Wars* Day\n* *Star Wars* documentaries\n* *Star Wars: The High Republic*\n* Space warfare in fiction\n* The Force\n* *The Story of Star Wars*\n* Technology in *Star Wars*\n* Wookieepedia, the Star Wars wiki\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The film's release was preceded by its novelization in November 1976.\n2. **^** Most existing spin-off media was made non-canon and rebranded as 'Legends' in April 2014.[2]\n3. **^** Lucas started by researching the inspiration behind Alex Raymond's *Flash Gordon* comic, leading him to the works of author Edgar Rice Burroughs—the *John Carter of Mars* series in particular.[50]\n4. **^** Played by Jake Lloyd as a child in *Episode I*\n5. **^** Each film was released two days later in the U.S.\n6. **^** The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucas's depiction of a \"used universe\".[132]\n7. **^** Not to be confused with the board game with the same name published in 1990[231]\n8. **^** In his early drafts, Lucas used the plot point of a dictator staying in power with the support of the military.

The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe.[b] *Star Wars* is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\nThe original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope*, was followed by the sequels *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi* (1983), forming the original *Star Wars* trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode I: The Phantom Menace* (1999), *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* (2002), and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of *Episode VII: The Force Awakens* (2015), *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* (2017), and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* (2019).\n\n\nAll nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for Academy Awards, with wins going to the first two releases. Together with the theatrical live action \"anthology\" films *Rogue One* (2016) and *Solo* (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, making *Star Wars* the third-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise depicts the adventures of characters \"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\"[3] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle.[4] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[5][6][7] The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a *Star Wars* planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[8] The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[9][10] Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[11][12][13] Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections and hyperspace transmission.[14]\n\n\nThe universe of *Star Wars* is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[15] One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as \"an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together\".[16] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[17] Through training and meditation, those whom \"the Force is strong with\" exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).[18] It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[19] The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[20][21] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.[22]\n\n\nThe franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires, such as the evil Galactic Empire.[23] The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts.[24] The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms.[25] In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.[26] Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.[26]\n\n\nThe combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes *Star Wars* a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.[27]\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars films\n\n### The Skywalker Saga[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Original trilogy: Episodes IV–VI\n |\n| *Star Wars* | May 25, 1977 (1977-05-25) | George Lucas | Gary Kurtz | [28][29] |\n| *The Empire Strikes Back* | May 21, 1980 (1980-05-21) | Irvin Kershner | Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan | George Lucas\n | [30][31] |\n| *Return of the Jedi* | May 25, 1983 (1983-05-25) | Richard Marquand | Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas\n | Howard Kazanjian | [32][33] |\n| Prequel trilogy: Episodes I–III\n |\n| *The Phantom Menace* | May 19, 1999 (1999-05-19) | George Lucas | George Lucas\n | George Lucas\n | Rick McCallum | [34] |\n| *Attack of the Clones* | May 16, 2002 (2002-05-16) | George Lucas and Jonathan Hales | [35][36] |\n| *Revenge of the Sith* | May 19, 2005 (2005-05-19) | George Lucas\n | [37][38] |\n| Sequel trilogy: Episodes VII–IX\n |\n| *The Force Awakens* | December 18, 2015 (2015-12-18) | J.

Abrams and Michelle Rejwan | [42][43] |\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\".[44] The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning *in media res* with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983. This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.[45]\n\n\nEach trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith lord Palpatine (Darth Sidious).[46] The original trilogy depicts the heroic development of Luke Skywalker as a Jedi and his fight against Palpatine's Galactic Empire alongside his sister, Leia.[47] The prequels tell the tragic backstory of their father, Anakin, who is corrupted by Palpatine and becomes Darth Vader.[48] The sequels feature Leia's son, Ben Solo, and Luke and Leia's protegé, Rey, thirty years after the fall of the Empire.[49]\n\n\n\n#### Original trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars original trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader's voice).\n\nIn 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the *Flash Gordon* serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera.[50][c] After directing *American Graffiti* (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in.[51][52] By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay.[53] Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost.[54]\n\n\n*Star Wars* was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled *Episode IV: A New Hope* in the 1979 book *The Art of Star Wars*.[55] The film's success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial.[56] With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies.[57] *Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back* was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, *Episode VI: Return of the Jedi*, was released on May 25, 1983.\n\n\n\n#### Prequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars prequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie Portman (Padmé Amidala), Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker),[d] and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine).\n\nAccording to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.[58] In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,[59] but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.[60] In 1983, Lucas explained that \"There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.\"[61]\n\n\nTechnical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be \"unbelievably expensive\".[62] In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.[63] A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 \"updated\" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.[64]\n\n\n*Episode I: The Phantom Menace* was released on May 19, 1999, *Episode II: Attack of the Clones* on May 16, 2002, and *Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* on May 19, 2005.[65] The first two films were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as \"the tragedy of Darth Vader\".[66]\n\n\n\n#### Sequel trilogy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars sequel trilogy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).\n\nPrior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned \"three trilogies of nine films\".[57][67] However, he announced to *Time* in 1978 that he planned \"10 sequels\".[68] He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981.[69] At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic,[70] the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy),[67] Luke's sister (not yet determined to be Leia),[58] Han, Leia,[71] R2-D2 and C-3PO.[57][72] However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that *Star Wars* was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.[73][74]\n\n\nLucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more *Star Wars* films.[75] That October, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that *Episode VII* would be released in 2015.[76] The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president and served as executive producer of new *Star Wars* feature films.[77] Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale,[78] but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had been discarded.[79][80] The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the *Star Wars* Expanded Universe stories, which were discarded from canon to give \"maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.\"[2]\n\n\n*Episode VII: The Force Awakens* was released on December 16, 2015, *Episode VIII: The Last Jedi* on December 13, 2017, and *Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker* on December 18, 2019, in many countries.[e] *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi* were both critical and box office successes.[81][82] *Episode IX* received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.[83]\n\n\n\n### Standalone films[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Screenplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Refs. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Rogue One: A Star Wars Story* | December 16, 2016 (2016-12-16) | Gareth Edwards | Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy | John Knoll and Gary Whitta | Kathleen Kennedy, Allison Shearmur and Simon Emanuel\n | [84] |\n| *Solo: A Star Wars Story* | May 25, 2018 (2018-05-25) | Ron Howard | Jonathan Kasdan & Lawrence Kasdan\n | [85] |\n\n\nSeveral *Star Wars* films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga.

Weiss would serve as writers and producers on a trilogy of new *Star Wars* movies.[99] The plot would take place chronologically before the Prequel Trilogy, and center around the origin of the Jedi.[100] By May 2019, the duo were also slated to serve as co-directors of the first installment in their three films.[101] In October of the same year however, the filmmaking duo exited development of the projects due to scheduling conflicts with projects they are developing for Netflix. Kennedy stated that the studio is open to working with the duo, and developing their films once their schedule allows it.[102]\n* **Untitled Taika Waititi film**: In May 2020, Taika Waititi signed onto the project which was stated to be the first priority for the studio, with the filmmaker Waititi serving as director from a script he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.[103] In May 2022, the movie was named as the next *Star Wars* film to begin production ahead of *Rogue Squadron*, with Kennedy stating that the studio was tentatively looking towards late 2023 for a debut, but had not yet officially set a release date.[104][105] By April 2023, she stated that the project is still in development, with Waititi continuing to work on the script.[106][98]\n* ***Rogue Squadron***: An anthology film, following the events of *Rogue One*, will be directed by Patty Jenkins with a script written by Matthew Robinson.[107] In April 2023, Kennedy stated that the script is still in development, with the studio considering changing the project into a television series.[108]\n* **Untitled J.D.

The film is being developed to debut via streaming, exclusively through Disney+.[111][112][113]\n* **Untitled Shawn Levy film**: In November 2022, Shawn Levy entered talks to direct a *Star Wars* film, following his work on *Deadpool 3* (2024) and the fifth and final season of *Stranger Things*.[114]\n* **Untitled Lando film**: A film focused on original trilogy character Lando Calrissian, reported to be written by Donald Glover (who portrayed the character in *Solo*) and Stephen Glover.[115]\n\n\n## Television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars television series\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise includes several live-action series. The first series, *The Mandalorian*, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga.[116] Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including *The Book of Boba Fett*, released in 2021; *Ahsoka*, released in 2023; and the upcoming *Skeleton Crew*.[117][118][119] These series follow the plight of the New Republic and its allies against the remnants of the fallen Galactic Empire.[120]\n\n\nA story focused on Obi-Wan Kenobi, a character from the original *Star Wars* trilogy, was planned as a film before becoming a live-action series after the box office failure of *Solo* in 2018.[92] The series was released on Disney+ in 2022 and is set between the prequel and original trilogy films.[121] It was followed by the live-action series *Andor* in the same year; both series follow their titular characters during the reign of the Empire.[121][122]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Live-action series** |\n| *The Mandalorian* | 3 | 24 | November 12, 2019 – present (2019-11-12 – present) | Disney+ |\n| *The Book of Boba Fett* | 1 | 7 | December 29, 2021 – February 9, 2022 (2021-12-29 – 2022-02-09) |\n| *Obi-Wan Kenobi* | 1 | 6 | May 27 – June 22, 2022 (2022-05-27 – 2022-06-22) |\n| *Andor* | 1 | 12 | September 21, 2022 – present (2022-09-21 – present) |\n| *Ahsoka* | 1 | 8 | August 22 – October 3, 2023 (2023-08-22 – 2023-10-03) |\n| **Game shows** |\n| *Jedi Temple Challenge* | 1 | 10 | June 10 – August 5, 2020 (2020-06-10 – 2020-08-05) | StarWarsKids.com |\n\n### Animated series[edit]\n\n\nThe first two animated series, *Droids* and *Ewoks*, were produced in the 1980s.[123] They were followed by the *Clone Wars* animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name. Following Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise's canon.[2] Subsequent animated series include *Rebels*, released in 2014; *Resistance*, released in 2018; and *The Bad Batch*, released in 2021. \n\n\nSeveral micro-series and shorts have also been released by Lucasfilm since Disney's acquisition, with the earlier animated series falling under Disney's \"Vintage\" collection of *Star Wars* content.[124][125]\n\n\n\n| Series | Seasons | Episodes | Originally released | Network |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Animated series** |\n| *Droids* | 1 | 13 | September 7, 1985 – June 7, 1986 (1985-09-07 – 1986-06-07) | ABC |\n| *Ewoks* | 2 | 26 | September 7, 1985 – December 13, 1986 (1985-09-07 – 1986-12-13) |\n| *The Clone Wars* | 7 | 133 | October 3, 2008 – May 4, 2020 (2008-10-03 – 2020-05-04) | Cartoon Network / Netflix / Disney+ |\n| *Rebels* | 4 | 75 | October 3, 2014 – March 5, 2018 (2014-10-03 – 2018-03-05) | Disney XD |\n| *Resistance* | 2 | 40 | October 7, 2018 – January 26, 2020 (2018-10-07 – 2020-01-26) | Disney Channel |\n| *The Bad Batch* | 2 | 47 | May 4, 2021 – present (2021-05-04 – present) | Disney+ |\n| *Visions* | 2 | 18 | September 22, 2021 – present (2021-09-22 – present) |\n| *Tales of the Jedi* | 1 | TBA | October 26, 2022 – present (2022-10-26 – present) |\n| *Young Jedi Adventures* | 1 | 25 | May 4, 2023 – present (2023-05-04 – present) | Disney+ / Disney Junior |\n| **Animated micro-series and shorts** |\n| *Clone Wars* | 3 | 25 | November 7, 2003 – March 25, 2005 (2003-11-07 – 2005-03-25) | Cartoon Network |\n| *Blips* | 1 | 8 | May 3 – September 4, 2017 (2017-05-03 – 2017-09-04) | YouTube |\n| *Forces of Destiny* | 2 | 32 | July 3, 2017 – May 25, 2018 (2017-07-03 – 2018-05-25) |\n| *Galaxy of Adventures* | 2 | 55 | November 30, 2018 – October 2, 2020 (2018-11-30 – 2020-10-02) |\n| *Roll Out* | 1 | 16 | August 9, 2019 – April 1, 2020 (2019-08-09 – 2020-04-01) |\n| *Galaxy of Creatures* | 2 | 24 | October 14, 2021 – February 21, 2023 (2021-10-14 – 2023-02-21) | StarWarsKids.com |\n| *Galactic Pals* | 1 | 12 | April 12 – November 1, 2022 (2022-04-12 – 2022-11-01) |\n| \"Zen – Grogu and Dust Bunnies\" | Short | 1 | November 12, 2022 (2022-11-12) | Disney+ |\n\n### Films and specials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Directed by\n | Teleplay by\n | Story by\n | Produced by\n | Network\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Star Wars Holiday Special* | November 17, 1978 (1978-11-17) | Steve Binder | Pat Proft, Leonard Ripps, Bruce Vilanch, Rod Warren, and Mitzie Welch\n | Joe Layton, Jeff Starsh, Ken Welch, and Mitzie Welch\n | CBS |\n| *The Ewok Adventure* | November 25, 1984 (1984-11-25) | John Korty | Bob Carrau\n | George Lucas | Thomas G.

A schism within the Jedi leads to the creation of the Sith.[126]\n* The High Republic: Under the protection of the Jedi, the Republic grows into a golden age. This era includes *The High Republic* literary works and the animated series *Young Jedi Adventures*.[126]\n* Fall of the Jedi: The Republic's Supreme Chancellor, Palpatine (secretly the Sith lord Darth Sidious), orchestrates the Clone Wars, overthrows the Republic, exterminates the Jedi Order and corrupts Anakin Skywalker.[126][130] This era includes the prequel trilogy films, the beginning of the episodic Skywalker saga, and the animated series *Tales of the Jedi* and *The Clone Wars*.[126]\n* Reign of the Empire: Palpatine's Galactic Empire rules the galaxy and the remaining Jedi are hunted down.[126] This era includes *Solo: A Star Wars Story*, *Obi-Wan Kenobi*, *Andor*, *Rogue One*, the animated series *The Bad Batch* and *Rebels*, and the video games *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor* and *Vader Immortal*.[126]\n* Age of Rebellion: The Rebellion against the Empire spreads across the galaxy, while the Jedi return with the emergence of Luke Skywalker.[126][131] This era includes the original trilogy films[f] and the video games *Star Wars Battlefront II* and *Star Wars: Squadrons*.[126]\n* The New Republic: Following the Empire's defeat, the emergent New Republic attempts to reunite the galaxy, while threatened by the remnants of the Empire.[126] This era includes *The Mandalorian*, *The Book of Boba Fett*, and *Ahsoka*.[126]\n* Rise of the First Order: The remnants of the Empire transform into the First Order but are fought by the Resistance, climaxing with the defeat of Palpatine and the Sith by the Jedi Rey.[126][130] This era includes the sequel trilogy films, the animated series *Star Wars Resistance* and the video game *Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge*.[126]\n* New Jedi Order: Rey builds a new Jedi Order, which will be depicted in an upcoming untitled film.[94][126]\n\n\nThe Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as *Legends* on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, *The Clone Wars* film, and television series.[2]\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars in other media\n\nFrom 1976 to 2014, the term *Expanded Universe* (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed *Star Wars* storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.[133] Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the *Star Wars Legends* label,[133] with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game *The Old Republic* the only *Legends* material to still be produced. The *Star Wars* canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film *The Clone Wars* (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.[2] Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement.\n\n\n\n### Print media[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars* in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of *Star Wars*, initially subtitled \"*From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker*\". Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster.[134] The first \"Expanded Universe\" story appeared in Marvel Comics' *Star Wars* #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* the following month.\n\n\n\n#### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Star Wars books\n\n![](image)Timothy Zahn authored the *Thrawn* trilogy, which was widely credited with revitalizing the dormant *Star Wars* franchise in the early 1990s.\nAfter penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel *Splinter of the Mind's Eye* (1978). The novelizations of *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) by Donald F. Glut and *Return of the Jedi* (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as *The Han Solo Adventures* trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian Daley,[135] and *The Adventures of Lando Calrissian* trilogy (1983) by L. Neil Smith.[136][137]\n\n\nTimothy Zahn's bestselling *Thrawn* trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon.[138][139][140][141] The first novel, *Heir to the Empire*, reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller list,[142] and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire.[143] In *The Courtship of Princess Leia* (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the *Thrawn* trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry.[144][145] Steve Perry's *Shadows of the Empire* (1996), set between *The Empire Strikes Back* and *Return of the Jedi*, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game.[146][147] The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works.[146][148] Other notable series from Bantam include the *Jedi Academy* trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson,[149][150] the 14-book *Young Jedi Knights* series (1995–1998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta,[150][151] and the *X-wing* series (1996–2012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.[152][153][154]\n\n\nDel Rey took over *Star Wars* book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called *The New Jedi Order* (1999–2003). Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy.[155][156] The bestselling multi-author series *Legacy of the Force* (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia's son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke's wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in *The Force Awakens* with Han and Leia's son Ben Solo, who becomes the evil Kylo Ren.[157][158][159][160]\n\n\nThree series set in the prequel era were published by Scholastic for younger audiences: the 18-book *Jedi Apprentice* (1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before *The Phantom Menace*; the 11-book *Jedi Quest* (2001–2004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between *The Phantom Menace* and *Attack of the Clones*; and the 10-book *The Last of the Jedi* (2005–2008), set almost immediately after *Revenge of the Sith*, features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi. In 2019, a new prequel era novel, starring Qui-Gon and the young Obi-Wan, was published by Del Rey under the title *Star Wars: Master and Apprentice*.[161]\n\n\nAlthough Thrawn had been designated a *Legends* character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in 2016 for the third season of the *Rebels* animated series, with Zahn returning to write more novels based on the character and set in the new canon.[162][163]\n\n\n\n#### Comics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Star Wars comics and List of Star Wars comic books\n\nMarvel Comics published a *Star Wars* comic book series from 1977 to 1986.[164][165][166][167] Original *Star Wars* comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine *Pizzazz* between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original *Star Wars* stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the *Star Wars* comic series.[168] From 1985 to 1987, the animated children's series *Ewoks* and *Droids* inspired comic series from Marvel's Star Comics line.[169][170][171] According to Marvel comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of *Star Wars* comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978.[172] Marvel's *Star Wars* series was one of the industry's top selling titles in 1979 and 1980.[173] The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.[174]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new *Star Wars* comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular *Dark Empire* series (1991–1995).[175] Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including *Tales of the Jedi* (1993–1998), *X-wing Rogue Squadron* (1995–1998), *Star Wars: Republic* (1998–2006), *Star Wars Tales* (1999–2005), *Star Wars: Empire* (2002–2006), and *Knights of the Old Republic* (2006–2010).[176][177]\n\n\nAfter Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the *Star Wars* comics license would return to Marvel Comics,[178] whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009.[179] Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled *Star Wars*, *Darth Vader*, and the limited series *Princess Leia*.[180][181][182]\n\n\nFirst announced as *Project Luminous* at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, the *Star Wars: The High Republic* publishing initiative were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the then current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga was explored in various books and comics. Including ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively.[183]\n\n\n\n### Audio[edit]\n\n\n#### Soundtracks and singles[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Star Wars\n\nJohn Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films; he has stated that he will retire from the franchise with *The Rise of Skywalker*.[184] He also composed Han Solo's theme for *Solo: A Star Wars Story*; John Powell adapted and composed the rest of the score.[185] Michael Giacchino composed the score of *Rogue One*.[185] Ludwig Göransson scored and composed the music of *The Mandalorian*.[186] Williams also created the main theme for *Galaxy's Edge*.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Audio novels[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Story of Star Wars and List of Star Wars books\n\nThe first *Star Wars* audio work is *The Story of Star Wars*, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars (radio)\n\nRadio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the *Star Wars* radio rights to KUSC-FM for US$1. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with Ben Burtt's sound effects.[189][190]\n\n\nThe first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes.[191][189][190] Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film roles.[191][189]\n\n\nThe overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of *The Empire Strikes Back* debuted in 1983.[192] Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute *Star Wars* audio drama titled *Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell*, written by Daley.[190][193] In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several *Star Wars* series from Dark Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part *Dark Empire* saga, *Tales of the Jedi*, *Dark Lords of the Sith*, the *Dark Forces* trilogy, and *Crimson Empire* (1998).[193] *Return of the Jedi* was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.[189][193]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Star Wars video games and List of Star Wars video games\n\nThe *Star Wars* franchise has spawned over one hundred[194] computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as *Star Wars Legends* and removed from the canon in 2014). *Star Wars* games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.\n\n\n\n#### Early licensed games (1979–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe first officially licensed electronic *Star Wars* game was Kenner's 1979 table-top *Star Wars Electronic Battle Command*.[195][196] In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first *Star Wars* video game for the Atari 2600, *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back*,[197] followed soon the year later by *Star Wars: Jedi Arena*, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari's rail shooter arcade game *Star Wars*, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.[198] The next game, *Star Wars: Return of the Jedi* (1984), has more traditional raster graphics,[199] while the following *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1985) has vector graphics.[200]\n\n\nPlatform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive *Star Wars* (1987), an international *Star Wars* (1991), and *Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back* (1992). *Super Star Wars* (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.\n\n\n\n#### LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: LucasArts\n\nLucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released *Star Wars: X-Wing*, the first self-published *Star Wars* video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise.[201] It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games.[201] The *Rogue Squadron* series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.\n\n\n*Dark Forces* (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy,[202] was the first *Star Wars* first-person shooter.[203] It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed game engine, the Jedi.[203][202][204][205] The game was well received,[206][207][208] and it was followed by four sequels.[209][210] The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.[211] Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,[203][212][213] a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.[157] A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, *Star Wars Galaxies*, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.[214]\n\n\n\n#### *EA Star Wars* (2014–present)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the *Star Wars* filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game *Jedi Challenges*, released in November 2017.[215][216] In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play *Star Wars* mobile games.[217] The *Battlefront* games received a canonical reboot with *Star Wars: Battlefront* in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, *Battlefront II*, in November 2017. A single-player action-adventure game, *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order*, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019. A space combat game titled *Star Wars: Squadrons*, which builds upon the space battles from *Battlefront*, was released in October 2020.\n\n\n\n### Theme park attractions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Star Wars theme parks attractions\n\nIn addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time *A Galactic Spectacular*. An immersive themed area called Galaxy's Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019.[218] A themed hotel, *Star Wars*: Galactic Starcruiser, operated from 2022 to 2023 at Walt Disney World.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made US$2.6 billion in merchandising revenue.[223] By 2012, the first six films produced approximately US$20 billion in merchandising revenue.[224]\n\n\nKenner made the first *Star Wars* action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997.[225] *Star Wars* was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history.[226] Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their *Star Wars* sets.[227] The Lego *Star Wars* video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.[228][229]\n\n\nIn 1977, the board game *Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star* was released.[230][g] A *Star Wars Monopoly* and themed versions of *Trivial Pursuit* and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. The board game *Risk* has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro: *The Clone Wars Edition* (2005)[232] and the *Original Trilogy Edition* (2006).[233] Three *Star Wars* tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.\n\n\n*Star Wars* Trading Cards have been published since the first \"blue\" series, by Topps, in 1977.[234] Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare \"promos\", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II \"floating Yoda\" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most \"base\" or \"common card\" sets are plentiful, many \"insert\" or \"chase cards\" are very rare.[235] From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the *Star Wars Customizable Card Game*.\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\n*Star Wars* features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as \"the shadow\".[236]\nThere are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil.[237] Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the \"Chosen One\", a messianic individual. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until *Return of the Jedi*. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is \"doing what he thinks is right\".[238] George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.[239]\n\n\nThe saga draws heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[237] Each character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain.[240] A defining step of the journey is \"Atonement with the Father\".[241] Obi-Wan's loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin,[242] whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to.[243] Luke's discovery that Vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema.[244] Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo.[238] Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side.[245] According to *Inverse*, the final scene in *The Last Jedi*, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that \"the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings.\"[246]\n\n\n\n### Historical influences[edit]\n\n\nPolitical science has been an important element of *Star Wars* since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War.[247][248] Darth Vader's design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet.[249][250] Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way that the *Schutzstaffel* served Adolf Hitler; this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader.[251] Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German \"shock\" troopers. Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II,[252] and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death's head on their caps. World War II terms were used for names in the films; *e.g.* the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front).[253] Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in *The Empire Strikes Back* resemble tank interiors,[254] and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights.[255]\n\n\nPalpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler's role before appointing himself *Führer*.[252] Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon.[256][257][h] The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives.[259] The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.[260][261]\n\n\nOn the inspiration for the First Order formed \"from the ashes of the Empire\", *The Force Awakens* director J. J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and \"started working together again.\"[262]\n\n\n\n* ![The aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.](image)\n\nThe aerial warfare of WWII inspired the space fights.\n* ![The flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.](image)\n\nThe flag and iconography of the Empire resembles those of the Nazi Party and Germany during its rule.\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe lightsaber and the blaster are iconic elements of the franchise.\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[263] with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[264] Phrases like \"evil empire\" and \"May the Force be with you\" have become part of the popular lexicon.[265] The first *Star Wars* film in 1977 was a cultural unifier,[266] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[267] The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre.[268] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including *Hardware Wars*, *Spaceballs*, *The Family Guy Trilogy* and *Robot Chicken: Star Wars*.\n\n\nIn 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original *Star Wars* film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[269] *The Empire Strikes Back* was selected in 2010,[270][271] and *Return of the Jedi* was selected in 2021.[272] 35 mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[273][274] but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.[275]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.[255] The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate.[276] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, *Star Wars* is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.[277][278]\n\n\n*Star Wars* fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before *Star Wars*, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.[279] The commercial success of *Star Wars* created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[276] Along with *Jaws*, *Star Wars* started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[280][267] It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.[266]\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book *The Great Movies*, \"Like *The Birth of a Nation* and *Citizen Kane*, *Star Wars* was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.\" It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon.[281] Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's *Jaws*, it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.[255][282][283]\n\n\nSome critics have blamed *Star Wars* and *Jaws* for \"ruining\" Hollywood by shifting its focus from \"sophisticated\" films such as *The Godfather*, *Taxi Driver*, and *Annie Hall* to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[284] One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, \"When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.\"[284][285] In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through *Star Wars* and *Jaws*, Lucas and Spielberg \"didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect\", which was \"a kind of rebirth\".[283]\n\n\nThe original *Star Wars* trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[286] Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by *Star Wars*, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter,[287] David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,[281] and later *Star Wars* directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.[288] Lucas's concept of a \"used universe\" particularly influenced Ridley Scott's *Blade Runner* (1982) and *Alien* (1979), James Cameron's *Aliens* (1986) as well as *The Terminator* (1984), George Miller's *Mad Max 2* (1981), and Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy (2001–2003).[281] Christopher Nolan cited *Star Wars* as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film *Inception*.[289]\n\n\n\n#### Fan works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars fan films\n\nThe *Star Wars* saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the *Star Wars* galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official *Star Wars* Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the *Star Wars* universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.[290] Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.[291]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\nAs the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.[292] Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.[293] Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S. have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.[294][295]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Speculative fiction portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![icon](image)Science fiction portal\n\n\n* 501st Legion\n* Architecture of *Star Wars*\n* Comparison of Star Trek and Star Wars\n* Jedi census phenomenon\n* Jediism\n* List of space science fiction franchises\n* List of *Star Wars* characters\n* List of *Star Wars* creatures\n* List of *Star Wars* planets and moons\n* Music of *Star Wars*\n* Physics and *Star Wars*\n* Star Wars Celebration\n* *Star Wars* Day\n* *Star Wars* documentaries\n* *Star Wars: The High Republic*\n* Space warfare in fiction\n* The Force\n* *The Story of Star Wars*\n* Technology in *Star Wars*\n* Wookieepedia, the Star Wars wiki\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The film's release was preceded by its novelization in November 1976.\n2. **^** Most existing spin-off media was made non-canon and rebranded as 'Legends' in April 2014.[2]\n3. **^** Lucas started by researching the inspiration behind Alex Raymond's *Flash Gordon* comic, leading him to the works of author Edgar Rice Burroughs—the *John Carter of Mars* series in particular.[50]\n4. **^** Played by Jake Lloyd as a child in *Episode I*\n5. **^** Each film was released two days later in the U.S.\n6. **^** The original trilogy depicts the galaxy as dirty and grimy in George Lucas's depiction of a \"used universe\".[132]\n7. **^** Not to be confused with the board game with the same name published in 1990[231]\n8. **^** In his early drafts, Lucas used the plot point of a dictator staying in power with the support of the military.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in Tønsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell—it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Saldaña as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves—again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schrödinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77–78% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640 million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1 billion and $1.5 billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2 billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5 billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120–140 million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5 million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200–250 million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260–300 million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260–270 million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300 million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1 million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100 million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5 million, including $60 million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3 million), and Sunday ($90.4 million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314 million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9 million on Monday and $33.1 million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4 million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3 million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600 million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8 million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700 million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2 million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3 million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800 million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1 million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2 million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680 million over its first five days for a global debut of $850–950 million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250–280 million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5 million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2 million (RMB 189 million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1 million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300 million.[163] Overall, the film made $169 million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9 million), South Korea ($8.4 million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1 million), France ($6 million), and Italy ($5.8 million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866 million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5 million; RMB 2.22 billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8 million), South Korea ($47.4 million), Mexico ($33.1 million), Australia ($30.8 million), Brazil ($26 million), Spain ($13.3 million), Japan ($13 million),[152] and Vietnam ($10 million).[180] It also made $21.6 million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4 million), the United Kingdom ($68.2 million), South Korea ($60.3 million), Mexico ($48.6 million), and India ($40.9 million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569 billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January 2021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632 million), United Kingdom ($115 million), South Korea ($105 million), Brazil ($86 million), and Mexico ($78 million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clichéd time travel plot – the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in Tønsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell—it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Saldaña as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves—again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schrödinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77–78% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640 million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1 billion and $1.5 billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2 billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5 billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120–140 million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5 million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200–250 million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260–300 million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260–270 million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300 million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1 million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100 million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5 million, including $60 million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3 million), and Sunday ($90.4 million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314 million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9 million on Monday and $33.1 million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4 million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3 million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600 million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8 million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700 million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2 million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3 million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800 million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1 million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2 million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680 million over its first five days for a global debut of $850–950 million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250–280 million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5 million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2 million (RMB 189 million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1 million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300 million.[163] Overall, the film made $169 million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9 million), South Korea ($8.4 million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1 million), France ($6 million), and Italy ($5.8 million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866 million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5 million; RMB 2.22 billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8 million), South Korea ($47.4 million), Mexico ($33.1 million), Australia ($30.8 million), Brazil ($26 million), Spain ($13.3 million), Japan ($13 million),[152] and Vietnam ($10 million).[180] It also made $21.6 million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4 million), the United Kingdom ($68.2 million), South Korea ($60.3 million), Mexico ($48.6 million), and India ($40.9 million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569 billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January 2021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632 million), United Kingdom ($115 million), South Korea ($105 million), Brazil ($86 million), and Mexico ($78 million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clichéd time travel plot – the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.
