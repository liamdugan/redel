Since Robinson's father was in the U.S. Navy, the family moved frequently. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. Robinson attended Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., where Robinson's father was working as an engineer.\n\n\nRobinson was of average height for most of his childhood and teenage years, and stood only 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall in his junior year of high school (age 16–17). But during his senior year (age 17–18) he experienced a large growth spurt and grew to 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m). He had not played organized basketball or attended any basketball camps,[9] but the school's basketball coach added him to the team, and Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches.\n\n\nRobinson graduated from Osbourn Park in 1983. He achieved a score of 1320 on the SAT, and chose to attend the United States Naval Academy, where he would major in mathematics and play on the basketball team. At the time the Naval Academy had a height restriction of 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) for all midshipmen, and in the autumn when the new academic year began Robinson had grown to 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m). Assuming that he was unlikely to grow much more, the academy's superintendent granted him a waiver. But Robinson continued growing, and by the start of his second year at the academy he had nearly reached his adult height of 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m), which later prevented him from serving on any U.S. naval ships.\n\n\n\n## College career and military service[edit]\n\n\nRobinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history.[10] He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol Ralph Sampson. He began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA,[9] but in Robinson's final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball's two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former University of Georgia interim head coach Pete Herrmann. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.\n\n\nRobinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, which would be detrimental to his naval career, and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and was required to serve only an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia.[11] He was regularly featured in recruiting materials for the service. Despite the nickname \"Admiral\", Robinson's actual rank upon fulfilling his service commitment was Lieutenant (junior grade).[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs (1989–2003)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year, DPOY award and scoring title (1989–1994)[edit]\n\n\nSince he had not signed a contract, NBA regulations stated that Robinson could have reentered the draft after his naval service.[9] Although there was speculation that he might choose not to sign with the Spurs,[13][14] Robinson agreed to move to San Antonio for the 1989–90 season, but the Spurs agreed to pay him as much as the average of the salaries of the two highest-paid players in the league each year, or release him to free agency.[9]\n\n\nThe Spurs had spent the second half of the 1980s as an also-ran, bottoming out in 1988–89 season with a 21–61 record,[15] the worst in franchise history at the time. While it was widely thought that the Spurs would become respectable again once Robinson arrived, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history at the time[16] (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98 season, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season). The Spurs leaped to a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA Rookie of the Year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled *David Robinson's Supreme Court*.[17] The Spurs made the playoffs seven more seasons in a row. In the 1991–92 season Robinson led the league in blocks and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Robinson also made the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team that won the gold medal in Barcelona. During the 1993–94 season, he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with Shaquille O'Neal, scoring 71 points (breaking George Gervin's single-game franchise record of 63) against the Los Angeles Clippers to win it.[18] In that season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game.[19]\n\n\n\n#### MVP title, playoff upsets and injury (1994–1998)[edit]\n\n\nRobinson went on to win the MVP trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[20] Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, Hakeem Olajuwon. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play. In a *LIFE* magazine story, he seemed perplexed. “Solve Hakeem?” said Robinson. “You don’t solve Hakeem.”[21]\n\n\nEarly in the 1996–97 season, Robinson's dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat,[22] and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably Sean Elliott, who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20–62 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery—and with it, the first pick in the next year's NBA draft. They used that pick to select Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson's quest for an NBA title.\n\n\n\n#### Championship season (1998–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robinson with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen at the Alamodome in 2000\nThe later years of Robinson's career were plagued by back ailments.[23][24]\nBefore the start of the 1998–99 season, the NBA owners and NBA commissioner David Stern locked out the NBA Players' Association to force negotiations on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37–13, giving them the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\n\nThe Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers by a combined record of 11–1 to reach the NBA Finals for the first time ever. In the Finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year power forward Tim Duncan proved overpowering, and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks in five games to become the first former American Basketball Association team to win an NBA title. Duncan was named Finals MVP.[25]\n\n\nRobinson and Duncan were nicknamed \"The Twin Towers\".[26][27]\n\n\n\n#### Twilight years and second championship (1999–2003)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1999–00 season, Robinson averaged 17.8 points per game, 10.0 rebounds per game and 2.3 blocks per game in 80 games. The Spurs made it to the playoffs as the fourth seed, but were defeated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs despite Robinson's 23.5 points, 13.8 rebounds, and 3 blocks per game.[28]\n\n\nRobinson announced he would retire from basketball following the 2002–03 season.[29]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2003, in the finale of Robinson's career, the Spurs won another NBA title with an 88–77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. During this game, Robinson scored 13 points, as well as getting 17 rebounds. He and the year's regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared *Sports Illustrated* magazine's 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award.[30]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nRobinson possessed tremendous mobility in the post, speed, and ball-handling, especially for a center. With good hands on both offense and defense, Robinson was nearly unstoppable on both sides of the floor, throwing down dunks and blocking shots. He was also noted for his strong midrange jumpshot.\n\n\nRobinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. He is also one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double[16] (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994).\n\n\nHe is also one of only eight players to record 70 or more points in a single game. Robinson scored 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994.[31] Only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), Devin Booker (70 points), Donovan Mitchell (71 points), Damian Lillard (71 points) and Kobe Bryant (81 points) have scored 70 or more points in a single game.[32][33]\n\n\nRobinson is also noteworthy for his harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan. Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did,[34] and to have reduced his own role in the team's offense to accommodate a younger star.[23] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Robinson as the 20th greatest player in NBA history.[35]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | San Antonio | **82**\\* | 81 | 36.6 | .531 | .000 | .732 | 12.0 | 2.0 | 1.7 | 3.9 | 24.3\n |\n| 1990–91 | San Antonio | **82**\\* | 81 | 37.7 | **.552** | .143 | .762 | **13.0**\\* | 2.5 | 1.5 | 3.9 | 25.6\n |\n| 1991–92 | San Antonio | 68 | 68 | 37.7 | .551 | .125 | .701 | 12.2 | 2.7 | **2.3** | **4.5**\\* | 23.2\n |\n| 1992–93 | San Antonio | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 39.2 | .501 | .176 | .732 | 11.7 | 3.7 | 1.5 | 3.2 | 23.4\n |\n| 1993–94 | San Antonio | 80 | 80 | **40.5** | .507 | **.345** | .749 | 10.7 | **4.8** | 1.7 | 3.3 | **29.8**\\*\n |\n| 1994–95 | San Antonio | 81 | 81 | 38.0 | .530 | .300 | **.774** | 10.8 | 2.9 | 1.7 | 3.2 | 27.6\n |\n| 1995–96 | San Antonio | **82** | **82**\\* | 36.8 | .516 | .333 | .761 | 12.2 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 3.3 | 25.0\n |\n| 1996–97 | San Antonio | 6 | 6 | 24.5 | .500 | .000 | .654 | 8.5 | 1.3 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997–98 | San Antonio | 73 | 73 | 33.7 | .511 | .250 | .735 | 10.6 | 2.7 | .9 | 2.6 | 21.6\n |\n| 1998–99†\n | San Antonio | 49 | 49 | 31.7 | .509 | .000 | .658 | 10.0 | 2.1 | 1.4 | 2.4 | 15.8\n |\n| 1999–00 | San Antonio | 80 | 80 | 32.0 | .512 | .000 | .726 | 9.6 | 1.8 | 1.2 | 2.3 | 17.8\n |\n| 2000–01 | San Antonio | 80 | 80 | 29.6 | .486 | .000 | .747 | 8.6 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 2.5 | 14.4\n |\n| 2001–02 | San Antonio | 78 | 78 | 29.5 | .507 | .000 | .681 | 8.3 | 1.2 | 1.1 | 1.8 | 12.2\n |\n| 2002–03†\n | San Antonio | 64 | 64 | 26.2 | .469 | .000 | .710 | 7.9 | 1.0 | .8 | 1.7 | 8.5\n |\n| Career\n | 987 | 985 | 34.7 | .518 | .250 | .736 | 10.6 | 2.5 | 1.4 | 3.0 | 21.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 10 | 3 | 18.4 | .588 | .000 | .695 | 6.2 | .8 | 1.3 | 1.3 | 14.1\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990 | San Antonio | 10 | 10 | 37.5 | .533 | .000 | .677 | 12.0 | 2.3 | 1.1 | **4.0** | 24.3\n |\n| 1991 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 41.5 | **.686** | .000 | **.868** | 13.5 | 2.0 | 1.5 | 3.8 | **25.8** |\n| 1993 | San Antonio | 10 | 10 | **42.1** | .465 | .000 | .664 | 12.6 | **4.0** | 1.0 | 3.6 | 23.1\n |\n| 1994 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 36.5 | .411 | .000 | .741 | 10.0 | 3.5 | .8 | 2.5 | 20.0\n |\n| 1995 | San Antonio | 15 | 15 | 41.5 | .446 | **.200** | .812 | 12.1 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 2.6 | 25.3\n |\n| 1996 | San Antonio | 10 | 10 | 35.3 | .516 | .000 | .667 | 10.1 | 2.4 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 23.6\n |\n| 1998 | San Antonio | 9 | 9 | 39.2 | .425 | .000 | .635 | **14.1** | 2.6 | 1.2 | 3.3 | 19.4\n |\n| 1999†\n | San Antonio | 17 | 17 | 35.3 | .483 | .000 | .722 | 9.9 | 2.5 | 1.6 | 2.4 | 15.6\n |\n| 2000 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 38.8 | .373 | .000 | .762 | 13.8 | 2.5 | **1.8** | 3.0 | 23.5\n |\n| 2001 | San Antonio | 13 | 13 | 31.5 | .472 | .000 | .695 | 11.8 | 1.7 | 1.3 | 2.4 | 16.6\n |\n| 2002 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 20.3 | .474 | .000 | .000 | 5.8 | 1.3 | .8 | .8 | 4.5\n |\n| 2003†\n | San Antonio | **23** | **23** | 23.4 | .542 | .000 | .667 | 6.6 | .9 | .8 | 1.3 | 7.8\n |\n| Career\n | 123 | 123 | 34.3 | .479 | .100 | .708 | 10.6 | 2.3 | 1.2 | 2.5 | 18.1\n |\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robinson at the free-throw line in 1992 as part of the “Dream Team”\nDavid Robinson was a member of the United States national team at the 1986 FIBA World Championship,[36] 1987 Pan American Games,[37] 1988 Summer Olympics,[38] 1992 Summer Olympics,[39] and 1996 Summer Olympics.[40] He won the gold medal at all tournaments except the 1987 Pan Am Games, where he won a silver medal, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robinson at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014\nRobinson married Valerie Hoggatt in 1991. They have three sons, David Jr., Corey, and Justin. Corey attended Notre Dame and was a wide receiver on the football team[41] before ending his playing career in 2016 on medical advice due to multiple concussions prior to what would have been his senior season.[42] He was very active on campus in his final undergraduate year, having been elected student body president in February 2016 for the 2016–17 school year.[43] Justin, a 6'8\" (2.03 m) forward in basketball and a two-time all-state selection in Texas, began attending Duke in August 2015. He was initially recruited to the Duke team as a \"preferred walk-on\" with the opportunity to eventually earn a scholarship, but was placed on scholarship before his arrival at Duke.[44] On September 18, 2020, Mornar Bar of Erste Liga announced that they had signed Justin, signaling the start to his professional basketball career.[45]\n\n\nRobinson became a Christian on June 8, 1991, after being encouraged to read the Bible.[9][46]\n\n\nIn 2001, Robinson founded and funded the $9 million Carver Academy in San Antonio, a non-profit private school named for George Washington Carver to provide more opportunities for inner-city children. In 2012, the school became a public charter school and its name changed to IDEA Carver. Robinson continues to be a very active participant in the school's day-to-day activities.[47][48]\n\n\nIn 2011, Robinson earned a Master of Arts in Administration (with concentration in organizational development) from the University of the Incarnate Word to better \"understand how businesses work and how to build them.\"[49]\n\n\nBeyond his founding of Carver Academy, Robinson is well known as a philanthropist. Robinson and business partner Daniel Bassichis donate 10 percent of their profits to charitable causes.[49] The winner of the NBA Community Assist Award is presented with the David Robinson Plaque.[50]\n\n\n\n### Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Robinson partnered with Daniel Bassichis, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a board member of The Carver Academy, to form Admiral Capital Group.[51] Admiral Capital Group is a private equity firm whose mission is to invest in opportunities that can provide both financial and social returns. Robinson's primary motivation in starting Admiral Capital was to create a source of additional financial support for The Carver Academy. Its portfolio is worth more than $100 million and includes nine upscale hotels and office buildings across the U.S. as well as Centerplate, one of the largest hospitality companies in the world. Admiral Capital Group also partnered with Living Cities to form the Admiral Center, a non-profit created to support other athletes and entertainers with their philanthropic initiatives. Robinson is also co-owner of a Jaguar Land Rover dealership in San Juan, Texas.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* Two-time NBA Champion\n* 1995 NBA MVP\n* 1992 NBA Defensive Player of the Year\n* 1990 NBA Rookie of the Year\n* 1990 NBA All-Rookie First Team\n* Four-time All-NBA First Team\n* Four-time All-Defensive First Team\n* 10-time NBA All-Star\n* One of 50 Greatest Players in NBA History\n* 1994 NBA Scoring Champion\n* Five-time IBM Award winner[54]\n* 2001 NBA Sportsmanship Award[55]\n* 2008 NBA Shooting Stars champion[56]\n* Number 50 retired by the San Antonio Spurs\n* 2021 Elected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* Two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner (1992, 1996)\n* Olympic Bronze Medal winner (1988)\n* Gold Medal at the 1986 FIBA World Championship.[57]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* 2012 NCAA Silver Anniversary Award[58]\n* Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award (2004)\n\n\n**Halls of Fame**\n\n\n\n* Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame\n\t+ class of 2009 – individual\n\t+ class of 2010 – as a member of the \"Dream Team\"\n* U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame\n\t+ class of 2008 – individual\n\t+ class of 2009 – as a member of the \"Dream Team\"\n* FIBA Hall of Fame\n\t+ class of 2013 - individual\n\t+ class of 2017 - as a member of the \"Dream Team\"\n\n\n**Media**\n\n\n\n* 2003 *Sports Illustrated* Sportsman of the Year\n* *In the Classroom with David Robinson* video made for distribution across American public schools in collaboration with public television producers[59]\n\n\n**Other**\n\n\n\n* Golden Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement (1987)[60]\n\n\n## Charitable efforts[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to his lengthy NBA career, Robinson is also noted for his charitable work. In 1991, Robinson visited with fifth-graders at Gates Elementary School in San Antonio and challenged them to finish school and go to college. He offered a $2,000 scholarship to everyone who did. In 1998, proving even better than his word, Robinson awarded $8,000 to each of those students who had completed his challenge. In perhaps his greatest civic and charitable achievement, David and his wife, Valerie, founded the Carver Academy in San Antonio, which opened its doors in September 2001. To date, the Robinsons have donated more than $11 million to the school.[61]\n\n\nIn March 2003, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to charity, the NBA renamed its award for outstanding charitable efforts in honor of Robinson. Winners of the NBA's Community Assist Award receive the *David Robinson Plaque*, with the inscription \"Following the standard set by NBA Legend David Robinson who improved the community piece by piece.\" The award is given out monthly by the league to recognize players for their charitable efforts. Robinson is also the recipient of the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[62] In 2011, in recognition of his philanthropic efforts with the Carver Academy, Robinson received the Children's Champion Award from the charitable organization Children's Hunger Fund.[63] In 2018, Robinson became a member of the V Foundation for Cancer Research's board of directors.[64]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association annual rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most blocks in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association rookie single-season scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association season blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association top rookie scoring averages\n* List of NBA players who have spent their entire career with one franchise\n* Quadruple-double\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 13 or more blocks in a game\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Men's Tournament of the Americas – 1992, USA Basketball.

Since Robinson's father was in the U.S. Navy, the family moved frequently. After his father retired from the Navy, the family settled in Woodbridge, Virginia, where Robinson excelled in school and in most sports, except basketball. Robinson attended Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C., where Robinson's father was working as an engineer.\n\n\nRobinson was of average height for most of his childhood and teenage years, and stood only 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) tall in his junior year of high school (age 16–17). But during his senior year (age 17–18) he experienced a large growth spurt and grew to 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m). He had not played organized basketball or attended any basketball camps,[9] but the school's basketball coach added him to the team, and Robinson earned all-area and all-district honors but generated little interest among college basketball coaches.\n\n\nRobinson graduated from Osbourn Park in 1983. He achieved a score of 1320 on the SAT, and chose to attend the United States Naval Academy, where he would major in mathematics and play on the basketball team. At the time the Naval Academy had a height restriction of 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) for all midshipmen, and in the autumn when the new academic year began Robinson had grown to 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m). Assuming that he was unlikely to grow much more, the academy's superintendent granted him a waiver. But Robinson continued growing, and by the start of his second year at the academy he had nearly reached his adult height of 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m), which later prevented him from serving on any U.S. naval ships.\n\n\n\n## College career and military service[edit]\n\n\nRobinson is widely considered to be the best basketball player in Naval Academy history.[10] He chose the jersey number 50 after his idol Ralph Sampson. He began college with no expectations of playing in the NBA,[9] but in Robinson's final two years he was a consensus All-American and won college basketball's two most prestigious player awards, the Naismith and Wooden Awards, as a Naval Academy first classman (senior). In 1986, Robinson led Navy, a number seven seed, within a game of the Final Four before falling to Duke in the East Regional Final. Robinson played his first three years for the Midshipmen under Paul Evans (who left Navy to coach at Pitt) and his senior season under former University of Georgia interim head coach Pete Herrmann. Upon graduation, he became eligible for the 1987 NBA draft and was selected by the San Antonio Spurs with the first overall pick; however, the Spurs had to wait two years because he had to fulfill his active-duty obligation with the Navy.\n\n\nRobinson considered leaving the academy after his second year, before incurring an obligation to serve on active duty. He decided to stay after discussing with the Superintendent the likelihood that his height would prevent him from serving at sea as an unrestricted line officer, which would be detrimental to his naval career, and might make it impossible for him to receive a commission at all. As a compromise, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman allowed Robinson to train for and receive a commission as a staff officer in the Civil Engineer Corps. As a result, Robinson was commissioned in the Naval Reserve and was required to serve only an initial active-duty obligation of two years. After graduating from the Naval Academy, Robinson became a civil engineering officer at the Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay in Georgia.[11] He was regularly featured in recruiting materials for the service. Despite the nickname \"Admiral\", Robinson's actual rank upon fulfilling his service commitment was Lieutenant (junior grade).[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs (1989–2003)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year, DPOY award and scoring title (1989–1994)[edit]\n\n\nSince he had not signed a contract, NBA regulations stated that Robinson could have reentered the draft after his naval service.[9] Although there was speculation that he might choose not to sign with the Spurs,[13][14] Robinson agreed to move to San Antonio for the 1989–90 season, but the Spurs agreed to pay him as much as the average of the salaries of the two highest-paid players in the league each year, or release him to free agency.[9]\n\n\nThe Spurs had spent the second half of the 1980s as an also-ran, bottoming out in 1988–89 season with a 21–61 record,[15] the worst in franchise history at the time. While it was widely thought that the Spurs would become respectable again once Robinson arrived, no one expected what happened in his rookie season. Robinson led the Spurs to the greatest single-season turnaround in NBA history at the time[16] (a record the Spurs themselves broke in 1997–98 season, after drafting Tim Duncan, which was then broken by the Boston Celtics in the 2007–08 NBA season). The Spurs leaped to a record of 56–26 for a remarkable 35 game improvement. They advanced to the second round of the Western Conference playoffs where they lost in seven games to the eventual conference champion Portland Trail Blazers. Following the 1989–90 season, he was unanimously named the NBA Rookie of the Year, and subsequently Sega produced a game featuring him entitled *David Robinson's Supreme Court*.[17] The Spurs made the playoffs seven more seasons in a row. In the 1991–92 season Robinson led the league in blocks and was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Robinson also made the 1992 US Olympic Dream Team that won the gold medal in Barcelona. During the 1993–94 season, he became locked in a duel for the NBA scoring title with Shaquille O'Neal, scoring 71 points (breaking George Gervin's single-game franchise record of 63) against the Los Angeles Clippers to win it.[18] In that season, Robinson averaged a career-high 29.8 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, career-high 4.8 assists per game and 3.3 blocks per game.[19]\n\n\n\n#### MVP title, playoff upsets and injury (1994–1998)[edit]\n\n\nRobinson went on to win the MVP trophy in 1995, and in 1996 he was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History.[20] Still, from 1991 to 1996, Robinson was thwarted in his quest to claim the one prize that had eluded him: an NBA title. During that span the Spurs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Warriors, Suns (twice), Jazz (twice), and Rockets. The loss against the Rockets was particularly painful for Robinson because it occurred in the Western Conference Finals with Robinson playing head-to-head against his chief rival, Hakeem Olajuwon. By his own admission, Robinson was outplayed by Olajuwon in the series, their only meetings in post-season play. In a *LIFE* magazine story, he seemed perplexed. “Solve Hakeem?” said Robinson. “You don’t solve Hakeem.”[21]\n\n\nEarly in the 1996–97 season, Robinson's dreams of becoming a champion seemed to vanish when he hurt his back in the preseason. He finally returned in December, but six games later broke his foot in a home game against the Miami Heat,[22] and ended up missing the rest of the regular season. As a result of the injury to Robinson and other key players (most notably Sean Elliott, who missed more than half the season), the Spurs finished the season with a dismal 20–62 record. However, his injury proved to be a blessing in disguise. Despite having only the third-worst record in the league, the Spurs won the NBA Draft Lottery—and with it, the first pick in the next year's NBA draft. They used that pick to select Tim Duncan out of Wake Forest University, who was, after a few years, the final key to Robinson's quest for an NBA title.\n\n\n\n#### Championship season (1998–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robinson with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen at the Alamodome in 2000\nThe later years of Robinson's career were plagued by back ailments.[23][24]\nBefore the start of the 1998–99 season, the NBA owners and NBA commissioner David Stern locked out the NBA Players' Association to force negotiations on a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. This lockout lasted for 202 days, well into the regular NBA season, before an agreement was finally reached. After playing a truncated 50-game season, the Spurs finished with an NBA-best record of 37–13, giving them the home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\n\nThe Spurs blitzed through the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers by a combined record of 11–1 to reach the NBA Finals for the first time ever. In the Finals, the combination of Robinson in the post and second-year power forward Tim Duncan proved overpowering, and the Spurs beat the New York Knicks in five games to become the first former American Basketball Association team to win an NBA title. Duncan was named Finals MVP.[25]\n\n\nRobinson and Duncan were nicknamed \"The Twin Towers\".[26][27]\n\n\n\n#### Twilight years and second championship (1999–2003)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1999–00 season, Robinson averaged 17.8 points per game, 10.0 rebounds per game and 2.3 blocks per game in 80 games. The Spurs made it to the playoffs as the fourth seed, but were defeated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs despite Robinson's 23.5 points, 13.8 rebounds, and 3 blocks per game.[28]\n\n\nRobinson announced he would retire from basketball following the 2002–03 season.[29]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2003, in the finale of Robinson's career, the Spurs won another NBA title with an 88–77 victory over the New Jersey Nets in Game 6 of the 2003 NBA Finals. During this game, Robinson scored 13 points, as well as getting 17 rebounds. He and the year's regular season and NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan shared *Sports Illustrated* magazine's 2003 Sportsmen of the Year award.[30]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nRobinson possessed tremendous mobility in the post, speed, and ball-handling, especially for a center. With good hands on both offense and defense, Robinson was nearly unstoppable on both sides of the floor, throwing down dunks and blocking shots. He was also noted for his strong midrange jumpshot.\n\n\nRobinson averaged 21.1 points per game, 10.7 rebounds per game, 3 blocks per game, and 2.5 assists per game over 987 games in his NBA career. He is also one of only a very small group of players to have scored over 20,000 career points in the NBA, as well as being one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double[16] (with 34 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 blocks against the Detroit Pistons on February 17, 1994).\n\n\nHe is also one of only eight players to record 70 or more points in a single game. Robinson scored 71 points against the Los Angeles Clippers on April 24, 1994.[31] Only Elgin Baylor (71 points), Wilt Chamberlain (70, 72, 73 twice, 78, 100 points), David Thompson (73 points), Devin Booker (70 points), Donovan Mitchell (71 points), Damian Lillard (71 points) and Kobe Bryant (81 points) have scored 70 or more points in a single game.[32][33]\n\n\nRobinson is also noteworthy for his harmonious relationship with Tim Duncan. Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that it was rare for someone like Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did,[34] and to have reduced his own role in the team's offense to accommodate a younger star.[23] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Robinson as the 20th greatest player in NBA history.[35]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989–90 | San Antonio | **82**\\* | 81 | 36.6 | .531 | .000 | .732 | 12.0 | 2.0 | 1.7 | 3.9 | 24.3\n |\n| 1990–91 | San Antonio | **82**\\* | 81 | 37.7 | **.552** | .143 | .762 | **13.0**\\* | 2.5 | 1.5 | 3.9 | 25.6\n |\n| 1991–92 | San Antonio | 68 | 68 | 37.7 | .551 | .125 | .701 | 12.2 | 2.7 | **2.3** | **4.5**\\* | 23.2\n |\n| 1992–93 | San Antonio | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 39.2 | .501 | .176 | .732 | 11.7 | 3.7 | 1.5 | 3.2 | 23.4\n |\n| 1993–94 | San Antonio | 80 | 80 | **40.5** | .507 | **.345** | .749 | 10.7 | **4.8** | 1.7 | 3.3 | **29.8**\\*\n |\n| 1994–95 | San Antonio | 81 | 81 | 38.0 | .530 | .300 | **.774** | 10.8 | 2.9 | 1.7 | 3.2 | 27.6\n |\n| 1995–96 | San Antonio | **82** | **82**\\* | 36.8 | .516 | .333 | .761 | 12.2 | 3.0 | 1.4 | 3.3 | 25.0\n |\n| 1996–97 | San Antonio | 6 | 6 | 24.5 | .500 | .000 | .654 | 8.5 | 1.3 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 17.7\n |\n| 1997–98 | San Antonio | 73 | 73 | 33.7 | .511 | .250 | .735 | 10.6 | 2.7 | .9 | 2.6 | 21.6\n |\n| 1998–99†\n | San Antonio | 49 | 49 | 31.7 | .509 | .000 | .658 | 10.0 | 2.1 | 1.4 | 2.4 | 15.8\n |\n| 1999–00 | San Antonio | 80 | 80 | 32.0 | .512 | .000 | .726 | 9.6 | 1.8 | 1.2 | 2.3 | 17.8\n |\n| 2000–01 | San Antonio | 80 | 80 | 29.6 | .486 | .000 | .747 | 8.6 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 2.5 | 14.4\n |\n| 2001–02 | San Antonio | 78 | 78 | 29.5 | .507 | .000 | .681 | 8.3 | 1.2 | 1.1 | 1.8 | 12.2\n |\n| 2002–03†\n | San Antonio | 64 | 64 | 26.2 | .469 | .000 | .710 | 7.9 | 1.0 | .8 | 1.7 | 8.5\n |\n| Career\n | 987 | 985 | 34.7 | .518 | .250 | .736 | 10.6 | 2.5 | 1.4 | 3.0 | 21.1\n |\n| All-Star\n | 10 | 3 | 18.4 | .588 | .000 | .695 | 6.2 | .8 | 1.3 | 1.3 | 14.1\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990 | San Antonio | 10 | 10 | 37.5 | .533 | .000 | .677 | 12.0 | 2.3 | 1.1 | **4.0** | 24.3\n |\n| 1991 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 41.5 | **.686** | .000 | **.868** | 13.5 | 2.0 | 1.5 | 3.8 | **25.8** |\n| 1993 | San Antonio | 10 | 10 | **42.1** | .465 | .000 | .664 | 12.6 | **4.0** | 1.0 | 3.6 | 23.1\n |\n| 1994 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 36.5 | .411 | .000 | .741 | 10.0 | 3.5 | .8 | 2.5 | 20.0\n |\n| 1995 | San Antonio | 15 | 15 | 41.5 | .446 | **.200** | .812 | 12.1 | 3.1 | 1.5 | 2.6 | 25.3\n |\n| 1996 | San Antonio | 10 | 10 | 35.3 | .516 | .000 | .667 | 10.1 | 2.4 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 23.6\n |\n| 1998 | San Antonio | 9 | 9 | 39.2 | .425 | .000 | .635 | **14.1** | 2.6 | 1.2 | 3.3 | 19.4\n |\n| 1999†\n | San Antonio | 17 | 17 | 35.3 | .483 | .000 | .722 | 9.9 | 2.5 | 1.6 | 2.4 | 15.6\n |\n| 2000 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 38.8 | .373 | .000 | .762 | 13.8 | 2.5 | **1.8** | 3.0 | 23.5\n |\n| 2001 | San Antonio | 13 | 13 | 31.5 | .472 | .000 | .695 | 11.8 | 1.7 | 1.3 | 2.4 | 16.6\n |\n| 2002 | San Antonio | 4 | 4 | 20.3 | .474 | .000 | .000 | 5.8 | 1.3 | .8 | .8 | 4.5\n |\n| 2003†\n | San Antonio | **23** | **23** | 23.4 | .542 | .000 | .667 | 6.6 | .9 | .8 | 1.3 | 7.8\n |\n| Career\n | 123 | 123 | 34.3 | .479 | .100 | .708 | 10.6 | 2.3 | 1.2 | 2.5 | 18.1\n |\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robinson at the free-throw line in 1992 as part of the “Dream Team”\nDavid Robinson was a member of the United States national team at the 1986 FIBA World Championship,[36] 1987 Pan American Games,[37] 1988 Summer Olympics,[38] 1992 Summer Olympics,[39] and 1996 Summer Olympics.[40] He won the gold medal at all tournaments except the 1987 Pan Am Games, where he won a silver medal, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robinson at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014\nRobinson married Valerie Hoggatt in 1991. They have three sons, David Jr., Corey, and Justin. Corey attended Notre Dame and was a wide receiver on the football team[41] before ending his playing career in 2016 on medical advice due to multiple concussions prior to what would have been his senior season.[42] He was very active on campus in his final undergraduate year, having been elected student body president in February 2016 for the 2016–17 school year.[43] Justin, a 6'8\" (2.03 m) forward in basketball and a two-time all-state selection in Texas, began attending Duke in August 2015. He was initially recruited to the Duke team as a \"preferred walk-on\" with the opportunity to eventually earn a scholarship, but was placed on scholarship before his arrival at Duke.[44] On September 18, 2020, Mornar Bar of Erste Liga announced that they had signed Justin, signaling the start to his professional basketball career.[45]\n\n\nRobinson became a Christian on June 8, 1991, after being encouraged to read the Bible.[9][46]\n\n\nIn 2001, Robinson founded and funded the $9 million Carver Academy in San Antonio, a non-profit private school named for George Washington Carver to provide more opportunities for inner-city children. In 2012, the school became a public charter school and its name changed to IDEA Carver. Robinson continues to be a very active participant in the school's day-to-day activities.[47][48]\n\n\nIn 2011, Robinson earned a Master of Arts in Administration (with concentration in organizational development) from the University of the Incarnate Word to better \"understand how businesses work and how to build them.\"[49]\n\n\nBeyond his founding of Carver Academy, Robinson is well known as a philanthropist. Robinson and business partner Daniel Bassichis donate 10 percent of their profits to charitable causes.[49] The winner of the NBA Community Assist Award is presented with the David Robinson Plaque.[50]\n\n\n\n### Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Robinson partnered with Daniel Bassichis, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a board member of The Carver Academy, to form Admiral Capital Group.[51] Admiral Capital Group is a private equity firm whose mission is to invest in opportunities that can provide both financial and social returns. Robinson's primary motivation in starting Admiral Capital was to create a source of additional financial support for The Carver Academy. Its portfolio is worth more than $100 million and includes nine upscale hotels and office buildings across the U.S. as well as Centerplate, one of the largest hospitality companies in the world. Admiral Capital Group also partnered with Living Cities to form the Admiral Center, a non-profit created to support other athletes and entertainers with their philanthropic initiatives. Robinson is also co-owner of a Jaguar Land Rover dealership in San Juan, Texas.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* Two-time NBA Champion\n* 1995 NBA MVP\n* 1992 NBA Defensive Player of the Year\n* 1990 NBA Rookie of the Year\n* 1990 NBA All-Rookie First Team\n* Four-time All-NBA First Team\n* Four-time All-Defensive First Team\n* 10-time NBA All-Star\n* One of 50 Greatest Players in NBA History\n* 1994 NBA Scoring Champion\n* Five-time IBM Award winner[54]\n* 2001 NBA Sportsmanship Award[55]\n* 2008 NBA Shooting Stars champion[56]\n* Number 50 retired by the San Antonio Spurs\n* 2021 Elected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* Two-time Olympic Gold Medal winner (1992, 1996)\n* Olympic Bronze Medal winner (1988)\n* Gold Medal at the 1986 FIBA World Championship.[57]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* 2012 NCAA Silver Anniversary Award[58]\n* Coach Wooden \"Keys to Life\" Award (2004)\n\n\n**Halls of Fame**\n\n\n\n* Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame\n\t+ class of 2009 – individual\n\t+ class of 2010 – as a member of the \"Dream Team\"\n* U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame\n\t+ class of 2008 – individual\n\t+ class of 2009 – as a member of the \"Dream Team\"\n* FIBA Hall of Fame\n\t+ class of 2013 - individual\n\t+ class of 2017 - as a member of the \"Dream Team\"\n\n\n**Media**\n\n\n\n* 2003 *Sports Illustrated* Sportsman of the Year\n* *In the Classroom with David Robinson* video made for distribution across American public schools in collaboration with public television producers[59]\n\n\n**Other**\n\n\n\n* Golden Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement (1987)[60]\n\n\n## Charitable efforts[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to his lengthy NBA career, Robinson is also noted for his charitable work. In 1991, Robinson visited with fifth-graders at Gates Elementary School in San Antonio and challenged them to finish school and go to college. He offered a $2,000 scholarship to everyone who did. In 1998, proving even better than his word, Robinson awarded $8,000 to each of those students who had completed his challenge. In perhaps his greatest civic and charitable achievement, David and his wife, Valerie, founded the Carver Academy in San Antonio, which opened its doors in September 2001. To date, the Robinsons have donated more than $11 million to the school.[61]\n\n\nIn March 2003, in recognition of his outstanding contributions to charity, the NBA renamed its award for outstanding charitable efforts in honor of Robinson. Winners of the NBA's Community Assist Award receive the *David Robinson Plaque*, with the inscription \"Following the standard set by NBA Legend David Robinson who improved the community piece by piece.\" The award is given out monthly by the league to recognize players for their charitable efforts. Robinson is also the recipient of the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.[62] In 2011, in recognition of his philanthropic efforts with the Carver Academy, Robinson received the Children's Champion Award from the charitable organization Children's Hunger Fund.[63] In 2018, Robinson became a member of the V Foundation for Cancer Research's board of directors.[64]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association annual rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most blocks in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association rookie single-season scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association season blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association top rookie scoring averages\n* List of NBA players who have spent their entire career with one franchise\n* Quadruple-double\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 13 or more blocks in a game\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season blocks leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Men's Tournament of the Americas – 1992, USA Basketball.

His profile on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states that \"by acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"[10] He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing the sport of basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon.[12]\n\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"**Air Jordan**\" and \"**His Airness**\".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13] During his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[15]\n\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[13] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[16] In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[17] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[18] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[19] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[20] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[21][22] In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23]\n\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[11][24] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[25] He starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film *Space Jam* (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series *The Last Dance* (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. He is also the owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[26] That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*.[28]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,[29] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[31][32] James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.[33] In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.[35][36]\n\n\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[35] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[36] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[37] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[38][39] after averaging 27 ppg,[37] 12 rebounds (rpg),[40][41] and six assists per game (apg) for the season.[41][42][43] He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[44] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[45]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJordan going in for a slam dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team, 1979–80\n![](image)\nJordan in action for North Carolina in 1983\n\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[13]\n\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[54]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early NBA years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[55] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[56] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[57]\n\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[58] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[46] and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[59][60][61] Roy S. Johnson of *The New York Times* described him as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[61] and Jordan appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated* with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[62][63] The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[64] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[65] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[64]\n\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[37][66] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[67][68] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[68][69] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[70][71] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[72] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[65] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[73] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA Champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor’s single-game playoff scoring record.[74] A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games.[64][74][75]\n\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[76] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][77] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[78] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[79] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[65] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)[edit]\n\n\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[80] and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[81] The Bulls finished 50–32,[65] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[82] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[64] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[83]\n\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[84]\n\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[65] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[85] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[86] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[64] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[87] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[88] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[65] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[89] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[64]\n\n\n\n#### First three-peat (1991–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan being defended by Mookie Blaylock (number 10) during a Bulls–Nets game in 1991\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[65] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[90] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[91]\n\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[90] Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[92] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[93] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[94] and he cried while holding the Finals trophy.[95]\n\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[65] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rbg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[80] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[96]\n\n\nIn the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[97] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[98] The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[94] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[99]\n\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[80][100] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[79] which upset him.[101] Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[102] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[94] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[103] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[104]\n\n\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bulls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[105] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[106] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[107] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[108][109] but the rumor spread widely.[110]\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of *60 Minutes* and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \n\n\n> Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n> \n> \n\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[111] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of *Jordan Rides the Bus*, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[110]\n\n\n#### First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nBaseball player\n\n\n\n| Michael Jordan |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Jordan in training with the Scottsdale Scorpions in 1994\n |\n| Birmingham Barons – No. 45, 35 |\n| **Outfielder** |\n| **Batted:** Right\n**Threw:** Right\n |\n| Professional debut |\n| **Southern League:** April 8, 1994, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| **Arizona Fall League:** 1994, for the Scottsdale Scorpions |\n| Last Southern League appearance |\n| March 10, 1995, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| Southern League statistics (through 1994) |\n| Batting average | .202 |\n| Home runs | 3 |\n| Runs batted in | 51 |\n| Arizona Fall League statistics |\n| Batting average | .252 |\n| Runs batted in | 8 |\n|  |\n| Teams |\n| * Birmingham Barons (1994–1995)\n* Scottsdale Scorpions (1994)\n |\n\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[112] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[113][114] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[114] Green and Demery were found after they made calls on James Jordan's cell phone,[115] convicted, and sentenced to life in prison.[116]\n\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, he imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[117][118] In his 1998 autobiography *For the Love of the Game*, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[119] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[120]\n\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[121] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[122] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[123] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[124]\n\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[125][126] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[127] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[122] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as *The Spirit* outside the new United Center.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the NBA (1995)[edit]\n\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[65] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[131] The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March;[132] the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.[133]\n\n\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[134] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[135] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[136] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[137] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[136]\n\n\nDespite his eighteen-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[64] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[138] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[139] and said that \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[140]\n\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[140] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[141] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Second three-peat (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[143] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[144] The Bulls eventually finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[145] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[146] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[13]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[144] Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards;[94] he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[64] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][95]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[147] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[148] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[149][150][151] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[148] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[147] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[94] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan with coach Phil Jackson in 1997\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[65] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[80] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[13] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[153][154] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[155]\n\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[156] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[156] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[156]\n\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[157][158][159][160] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[161] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[162] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[163] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[94] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[164] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history,[165] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Second retirement (1999–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque at the United Center that chronicles Jordan's career achievements\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[167][168][169] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[170] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[171][172] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[173][174] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[171][175]\n\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[95] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[176][177] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[178] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[179] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Washington Wizards (2001–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[180][181] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[182][183] he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[184] After suffering torn cartilage in his right knee,[185] and subsequent knee soreness,[186] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[187] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[188] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan as a member of the Washington Wizards, April 14, 2003\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[189][190] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15. He averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[64] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[191] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[192] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[193][194] At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[193][194]\n\n\n\n#### Final retirement (2003)[edit]\n\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[195] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[196] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[197] in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[198] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[199]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan on the \"Dream Team\" in 1992\nJordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[200][201] A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[202]\n\n\nIn 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team went on to win two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[203] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.[204] Jordan was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan dunking the ball, 1987–88\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards,[13] and as a point guard.[84] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[205] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[206][207][208] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.[209]\n\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[13][210] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[13] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[211][212] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[213]\n\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[214] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[215] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\n\nThree-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in Jordan's career, he improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a respectable 32% success rate.[46] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.[13] Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[13]\n\n\nUnlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense. Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century,[216] with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.[217] Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. Jordan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 38.9%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in the playoffs during his championship runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line.[218][219][220]\n\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[221] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[222] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[223] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[224]\n\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[225] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[226]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Michael Jordan](image) | This article is part of a series aboutMichael Jordan |\n\n |\n| Career\n* Career achievements\n* The Shot\n* Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals\n* 1982 NCAA Championship Game\n* Air Jordan (Jumpman)\n* Jordan Rules\n |\n| Family\n* James R.

In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[230] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[231] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[232] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[232]\n\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.[13][233] Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[13] He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[234] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[23] Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[235] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[236] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[237] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[238]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Magic Johnson[5]\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[223] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[239] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[240] In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[241] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of *Sports Illustrated* a record 50 times.[242] In the September 1996 issue of *Sport*, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[243]\n\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[244][245] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.[246][247] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[248][249][250] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[251] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[252]\n\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[244] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[244] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[253] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[253] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[254]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[255] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[256] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[17] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[257][258] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[259] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season. The \"Michael Jordan Trophy\" will replace the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff, with a new Podoloff Trophy set to be awarded to the team with the best overall regular season record.[260][261]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of career achievements by Michael Jordan § NBA career statistics\n\nSee also: List of

He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[282] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[283][284]\n\n\n\n### Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[285][286] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[287] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[289] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[290] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[291] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner.[292]\n\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, *The New York Times* wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[293] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[294] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[294]\n\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[295] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[296]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself,[297] as well as the role of chairman.[298] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake of the team to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner of the Hornets, although he is keeping a minority stake.[299] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[300]\n\n\n\n### 23XI Racing[edit]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[301] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[302] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[303][304] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[305][306][307] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[308] 23XI Racing has won four races, two by Wallace, one by Busch, and one by Reddick.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House\nJordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played NCAA Division I basketball for the UNC Greensboro Spartans and is a scout for the Charlotte Hornets.[311][312]\n\n\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[313][314] They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine.[315] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[316][317] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[318][319]\n\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. He listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[320] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[321]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[322] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[323][324][325] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[322]\n\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[326] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[327][328] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[329][330] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[331] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[332]\n\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan in 2008\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[333] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[333][334]\n\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[335] One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[333] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[336][337] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[338][339]\n\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[340] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film *Space Jam*, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[341] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[341] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[342]\n\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[343][344] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[345] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[346] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[347]\n\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[348] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[349]\n\n\n\n### Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by *Forbes* as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to *Forbes*, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[350] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[351][352] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the *Charlotte Business Journal'*s Business Person of the Year for 2014.[353] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[354]\n\n\n*Forbes* designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[355] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[356] As of 2023[update], his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*,[28] making him the fifth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Rihanna.[357]\n\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[358] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[359][360] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[359] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[361] that restaurant closed in 2018.[362] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII, under construction in Hobe Sound, Florida.[363]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[364]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[365] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[366] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[367]\n\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[365] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[368] As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[365] In 2023, Jordan donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[369]\n\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[370] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[371] In 2018, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[372] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[373]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[374] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[375][376]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film *Space Jam*. The film received mixed reviews,[377] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[378]\n\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled *Michael Jordan to the Max*.[379] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning *The Last Dance*, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. *The Last Dance* relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[380][381] He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[382]\n\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[383] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries *The Captain*, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[384]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\n\n\n* *Rare Air: Michael on Michael*, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993).[385][386]\n* *I Can't Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence*, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).[387]\n* *For the Love of the Game: My Story*, with Mark Vancil (Crown Publishers, 1998).[388]\n* *Driven from Within*, with Mark Vancil (Atria Books, 2005).[389]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes\n* List of athletes who came out of retirement\n* List of NBA teams by single season win percentage\n* Michael Jordan's Restaurant\n* *Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City*\n* *Michael Jordan in Flight*\n* *NBA 2K11*\n* *NBA 2K12*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jordan's weight fluctuated from 195 to 218 lb (88 to 99 kg) during the course of his professional career;[1][2][3] his NBA listed weight was 216 lb (98 kg).[4][5][6]\n2. **^** Jordan wore a nameless No. 12 jersey in a February 14, 1990, game against the Orlando Magic because his No. 23 jersey had been stolen.[7] Jordan scored 49 points, setting a franchise record for players wearing that jersey number.[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Telander, Rick (February 14, 2018). \"Michael Jordan Put on a Helluva Show at '88 All-Star Weekend\". *Slam*.

Jordan's return from three years of retirement has been remarkable, with five 40-point performances already. He is also rebounding and handing out assists on par with his career averages. Most importantly, his indomitable will and thirst for winning have lifted Washington into playoff contention with more wins by Jan. 24 than they had all of last season. ...

His profile on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states that \"by acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"[10] He played fifteen seasons in the NBA, winning six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in popularizing the sport of basketball and the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,[11] becoming a global cultural icon.[12]\n\n\nJordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982.[5] Jordan joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick[5][13] and quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best defensive players.[14] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames \"**Air Jordan**\" and \"**His Airness**\".[5][13] Jordan won his first NBA title with the Bulls in 1991 and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season.[5] He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.[5][13] During his professional career, he was also selected to play for the United States national team, winning four gold medals—at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics—while also being undefeated.[15]\n\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, ten NBA scoring titles (both all-time records), five NBA MVP awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine All-Defensive First Team honors, fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections, three NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, three NBA steals titles, and the 1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[13] He holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average (30.1 points per game) and career playoff scoring average (33.4 points per game).[16] In 1999, he was named the 20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century.[5] Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career,[17] and again in 2010 as part of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team (\"The Dream Team\").[18] He became a member of the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009,[19] a member of the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2010,[20] and an individual member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015 and a \"Dream Team\" member in 2017.[21][22] In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23]\n\n\nOne of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan made many product endorsements.[11][24] He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular.[25] He starred as himself in the live-action/animation hybrid film *Space Jam* (1996) and was the central focus of the Emmy-winning documentary series *The Last Dance* (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets (then named the Bobcats) in 2006 and bought a controlling interest in 2010, before selling his majority stake in 2023. He is also the owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. In 2016, he became the first billionaire player in NBA history.[26] That year, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] As of 2023, his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*.[28]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMichael Jeffrey Jordan was born at Cumberland Hospital in the Fort Greene neighborhood of New York City's Brooklyn borough on February 17, 1963,[29] to bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R. Jordan Sr.[29][30] He has two older brothers, James R. Jordan Jr. and fellow basketball player Larry Jordan, as well as an older sister named Deloris and a younger sister named Roslyn.[31][32] James Jr. became command sergeant major of the 35th Signal Brigade of the U.S. Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and retired in 2006.[33] In 1968, Jordan moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina.[34] He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the basketball varsity team during his sophomore year, but at a height of 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the only sophomore to make the team.[35][36]\n\n\nMotivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's junior varsity team and tallied some 40-point games.[35] The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously.[36] Upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, he averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play.[37] As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points,[38][39] after averaging 27 ppg,[37] 12 rebounds (rpg),[40][41] and six assists per game (apg) for the season.[41][42][43] He was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including Duke, North Carolina, South Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginia.[44] In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography.[45]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJordan going in for a slam dunk for the Laney High School varsity basketball team, 1979–80\n![](image)\nJordan in action for North Carolina in 1983\n\nAs a freshman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented system, Jordan was named ACC Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage).[46] He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 NCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing.[47] Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.[48][49] During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting and added 5.0 rpg and 1.8 apg.[13]\n\n\nJordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons.[50][51] After winning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986,[52] when he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in geography.[53] In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[54]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early NBA years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.[55] Trail Blazers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center but more a matter of taking Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already had Clyde Drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to Jordan.[56] Citing Bowie's injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers' choice of Bowie as the worst draft pick in North American professional sports history.[57]\n\n\nJordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium on October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stub from the game sold at auction for $264,000, setting a record for a collectible ticket stub.[58] During his rookie 1984–85 season with the Bulls, Jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting,[46] and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas.[59][60][61] Roy S. Johnson of *The New York Times* described him as \"the phenomenal rookie of the Bulls\" in November,[61] and Jordan appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated* with the heading \"A Star Is Born\" in December.[62][63] The fans also voted in Jordan as an All-Star starter during his rookie season.[5] Controversy arose before the 1985 NBA All-Star Game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving.[5] This led to a so-called \"freeze-out\" on Jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him.[5] The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year.[64] The Bulls finished the season 38–44,[65] and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.[64]\n\n\nAn often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985,[37][66] when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dunk.[67][68] The moment was filmed and is often referred to as an important milestone in Jordan's rise.[68][69] The shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in August 2020 for $615,000, a record for a pair of sneakers.[70][71] Jordan's 1985–86 season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games.[72] The Bulls made the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,[65] at the time the fifth-worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.[73] Jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. On April 20 at the Boston Garden, in Game 2 of the First Round, a 135–131 double overtime loss to the eventual NBA Champion Boston Celtics, Jordan scored a playoff career-high 63 points, breaking Elgin Baylor’s single-game playoff scoring record.[74] A Celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history swept the series in three games.[64][74][75]\n\n\nJordan completely recovered in time for the 1986–87 season,[76] and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history; he became the only player other than Wilt Chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league-high 37.1 ppg on 48.2% shooting.[46][77] In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season.[78] Despite Jordan's success, Magic Johnson won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[79] The Bulls reached 40 wins,[65] and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year but were again swept by the Celtics.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Pistons roadblock (1987–1990)[edit]\n\n\nJordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987–88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,[46] and he won his first league MVP Award. He was also named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, as he averaged 1.6 blocks per game (bpg), a league-high 3.1 steals per game (spg),[80] and led the Bulls defense to the fewest points per game allowed in the league.[81] The Bulls finished 50–32,[65] and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games.[82] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Bulls lost in five games to the more experienced Detroit Pistons,[64] who were led by Isiah Thomas and a group of physical players known as the \"Bad Boys\".[83]\n\n\nIn the 1988–89 season, Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg.[46] During the season, Sam Vincent, Chicago's point guard, was having trouble running the offense, and Jordan expressed his frustration with head coach Doug Collins, who then put Jordan at point guard. In his time as a point guard, Jordan had 10 triple-doubles in 11 games, with averages of 33.6 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 10.8 apg, 2.9 spg, and 0.8 bpg on 51% shooting.[84]\n\n\nThe Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,[65] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and New York Knicks along the way.[85] The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.[86] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,[64] by utilizing their \"Jordan Rules\" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.[5]\n\n\nThe Bulls entered the 1989–90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, and under the guidance of new coach Phil Jackson.[87] On March 28, 1990, Jordan scored a career-high 69 points in a 117–113 road win over the Cavaliers.[88] He averaged a league-leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg,[46] in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.[65] They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals after beating the Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers;[89] despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.[64]\n\n\n\n#### First three-peat (1991–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan being defended by Mookie Blaylock (number 10) during a Bulls–Nets game in 1991\nIn the 1990–91 season, Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.[46] The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in sixteen years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.[65] With Scottie Pippen developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the New York Knicks and the Philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them;[90] this time, the Bulls beat the Pistons in a four-game sweep.[91]\n\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Finals for the first time in franchise history to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Magic Johnson and James Worthy, two formidable opponents. The Bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15–2 playoff record along the way.[90] Perhaps the best-known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential Sam Perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket.[92] In his first Finals appearance, Jordan had 31.2 ppg on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 apg, 6.6 rpg, 2.8 spg, and 1.4 bpg.[93] Jordan won his first NBA Finals MVP award,[94] and he cried while holding the Finals trophy.[95]\n\n\nJordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the 1991–92 season, establishing a 67–15 record, topping their franchise record from the 1990–91 campaign.[65] Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with averages of 30.1 ppg, 6.4 rbg, and 6.1 apg on 52% shooting.[80] After winning a physical seven-game series over the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in six games, the Bulls met Clyde Drexler and the Portland Trail Blazers in the Finals. The media, hoping to recreate a Magic–Bird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between \"Air\" Jordan and Clyde \"The Glide\" during the pre-Finals hype.[96]\n\n\nIn the first game, Jordan scored a Finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals.[97] After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. Marv Albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying: \"I can't believe I'm doing this.\"[98] The Bulls went on to win Game 1 and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row,[94] and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 52.6% from the floor.[99]\n\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, including a second-place finish in Defensive Player of the Year voting,[80][100] Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended, as he lost the award to his friend Charles Barkley,[79] which upset him.[101] Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,[102] and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.[94] He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in four consecutive games.[103] With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.[104]\n\n\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bulls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the night before Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Knicks.[105] The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,[106] and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course.[107] David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, denied in 1995 and 2006 that Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling,[108][109] but the rumor spread widely.[110]\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Jordan discussed his gambling with Ed Bradley of *60 Minutes* and admitted that he made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: \n\n\n> Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah.\n> \n> \n\n When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied: \"No.\"[111] In 2010, Ron Shelton, director of *Jordan Rides the Bus*, said that he began working on the documentary believing that the NBA had suspended him, but that research \"convinced [him it] was nonsense\".[110]\n\n\n#### First retirement and stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nBaseball player\n\n\n\n| Michael Jordan |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Jordan in training with the Scottsdale Scorpions in 1994\n |\n| Birmingham Barons – No. 45, 35 |\n| **Outfielder** |\n| **Batted:** Right\n**Threw:** Right\n |\n| Professional debut |\n| **Southern League:** April 8, 1994, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| **Arizona Fall League:** 1994, for the Scottsdale Scorpions |\n| Last Southern League appearance |\n| March 10, 1995, for the Birmingham Barons |\n| Southern League statistics (through 1994) |\n| Batting average | .202 |\n| Home runs | 3 |\n| Runs batted in | 51 |\n| Arizona Fall League statistics |\n| Batting average | .252 |\n| Runs batted in | 8 |\n|  |\n| Teams |\n| * Birmingham Barons (1994–1995)\n* Scottsdale Scorpions (1994)\n |\n\n\nOn October 6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball. Jordan later said that the murder of his father three months earlier helped shape his decision.[112] James R. Jordan Sr. was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked his Lexus.[113][114] His body, dumped in a South Carolina swamp, was not discovered until August 3.[114] Green and Demery were found after they made calls on James Jordan's cell phone,[115] convicted, and sentenced to life in prison.[116]\n\n\nJordan was close to his father; as a child, he imitated the way his father stuck out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket.[5] In 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.[117][118] In his 1998 autobiography *For the Love of the Game*, Jordan wrote that he was preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.[119] The added exhaustion due to the \"Dream Team\" run in the 1992 Summer Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.[120]\n\n\nJordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[121] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[122] Jordan said that this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.[123] The White Sox were owned by Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who continued to honor Jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.[124]\n\n\nIn 1994, Jordan played for the Birmingham Barons, a Double-A minor league affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 bases on balls, and 11 errors.[125][126] His strikeout total led the team and his games played tied for the team lead. His 30 stolen bases were second on the team only to Doug Brady.[127] He also appeared for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the 1994 Arizona Fall League, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball.[122] On November 1, 1994, his No. 23 was retired by the Bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as *The Spirit* outside the new United Center.[128][129][130]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the NBA (1995)[edit]\n\n\nThe Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan in the lineup[65] and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs.[131] The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March;[132] the team received help when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls.[133]\n\n\nIn March 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseball because he feared he might become a replacement player during the Major League Baseball strike.[134] On March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his return to the NBA in a two-word press release: \"I'm back.\"[135] The next day, Jordan took to the court with the Bulls to face the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points.[136] The game had the highest Nielsen rating of any regular season NBA game since 1975.[137] Although he could have worn his original number even though the Bulls retired it, Jordan wore No. 45, his baseball number.[136]\n\n\nDespite his eighteen-month hiatus from the NBA, Jordan played well, making a game-winning jump shot against Atlanta in his fourth game back. He scored 55 points in his next game, against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995.[64] Boosted by Jordan's comeback, the Bulls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Orlando Magic.[138] At the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the Magic; he later commented that Jordan \"didn't look like the old Michael Jordan\",[139] and said that \"No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to\".[140]\n\n\nJordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which Chicago won. Before the game, Jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.[140] Jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the Bulls wore black.[141] He averaged 31 ppg in the playoffs, but Orlando won the series in six games.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Second three-peat (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\nJordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995–96 season.[143] The Bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist Dennis Rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41–3.[144] The Bulls eventually finished with the best regular season record in NBA history, 72–10, a mark broken two decades later by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.[145] Jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg,[146] and he won the league's regular season and All-Star Game MVP awards.[13]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Bulls lost only three games in four series (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship.[144] Jordan was named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards;[94] he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regular season, and NBA Finals after Willis Reed in the 1969–70 season.[64] Upon winning the championship, his first since his father's murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying on the locker room floor.[5][95]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Bulls stood at a 69–11 record but ended the season by losing their final two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win season.[147] The Bulls again advanced to the Finals, where they faced the Utah Jazz.[148] That team included Karl Malone, who had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957).[149][150][151] The series against the Jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 for the Bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. In Game 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. In what is known as \"The Flu Game\", Jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining.[148] The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six games.[147] For the fifth time in as many Finals appearances, Jordan received the Finals MVP award.[94] During the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, Jordan posted the first triple-double in All-Star Game history in a victorious effort, but the MVP award went to Glen Rice.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan with coach Phil Jackson in 1997\nJordan and the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record in the 1997–98 season.[65] Jordan led the league with 28.7 ppg,[80] securing his fifth regular season MVP award, plus honors for All-NBA First Team, First Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.[13] The Bulls won the Eastern Conference Championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals; it was the first time Jordan had played in a Game 7 since the 1992 Eastern Conference Semifinals with the New York Knicks.[153][154] After winning, they moved on for a rematch with the Jazz in the Finals.[155]\n\n\nThe Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history.[156] With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85.[156] The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and stole the ball out of his hands.[156]\n\n\nJordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul.[157][158][159][160] With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made the climactic shot of his Bulls career,[161] a top-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead. Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship,[162] achieving a second three-peat in the decade.[163] Once again, Jordan was voted Finals MVP for a record sixth time,[94] having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 ppg, including 45 in the deciding Game 6.[164] The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history,[165] and Game 6 holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.[166]\n\n\n\n#### Second retirement (1999–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Plaque at the United Center that chronicles Jordan's career achievements\nWith Phil Jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999.[167][168][169] On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards.[170] Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters; opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed.[171][172] He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (like forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland)[173][174] but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high school student Kwame Brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.[171][175]\n\n\nDespite his January 1999 claim that he was \"99.9% certain\" he would never play another NBA game,[95] Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback in the summer of 2001, this time with his new team.[176][177] Inspired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter,[178] Jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago.[179] Jordan hired his old Chicago Bulls head coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another Jordan return.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### Washington Wizards (2001–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2001, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the September 11 attacks.[180][181] In an injury-plagued 2001–02 season, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.4 spg),[5] and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizards to a winning record and playoff contention;[182][183] he would eventually finish 13th in the MVP ballot.[184] After suffering torn cartilage in his right knee,[185] and subsequent knee soreness,[186] the Wizards missed the playoffs,[187] and Jordan's season ended after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994–95 season.[46] Jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 ppg, 5.4 apg, and 6.0 rpg, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.[188] The Wizards finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan as a member of the Washington Wizards, April 14, 2003\nPlaying in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Game history, a record since broken by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.[189][190] That year, Jordan was the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15. He averaged 20.0 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 spg per game.[5] He also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free-throw line.[46] Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times.[64] On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game.[191] During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's home games at the MCI Center were sold out and the Wizards were the second most-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road.[192] Jordan's final two seasons did not result in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and he was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him.[193][194] At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of Kwame Brown, the number-one draft pick in the 2001 NBA draft.[193][194]\n\n\n\n#### Final retirement (2003)[edit]\n\n\nWith the recognition that 2002–03 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final game at the United Center in Chicago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovation.[195] The Miami Heat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though Jordan never played for the team.[196] At the 2003 All-Star Game, Jordan was offered a starting spot from Tracy McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both;[197] in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter.[198] Jordan played in his final NBA game on April 16, 2003, in Philadelphia. After scoring 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting \"We want Mike!\" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.[199]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan on the \"Dream Team\" in 1992\nJordan made his debut for the U.S. national basketball team at the 1983 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He led the team in scoring with 17.3 ppg as the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won the gold medal.[200][201] A year later, he won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The 1984 U.S. team was coached by Bob Knight and featured players such as Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, Steve Alford, and Wayman Tisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.[202]\n\n\nIn 1992, Jordan was a member of the star-studded squad that was dubbed the \"Dream Team\", which included Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The team went on to win two gold medals: the first in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas,[203] and the second in the 1992 Summer Olympics. He was the only player to start all eight games in the Olympics, averaged 14.9 ppg, and finished second on the team in scoring.[204] Jordan was undefeated in the four tournaments he played for the United States national team, winning all 30 games he took part in.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan dunking the ball, 1987–88\nJordan was a shooting guard who could also play as a small forward, the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the Washington Wizards,[13] and as a point guard.[84] Jordan was known throughout his career as a strong clutch performer. With the Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two NBA Finals games and five other playoff contests.[205] His competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash talk and well-known work ethic.[206][207][208] Jordan often used perceived slights to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thompson described him as \"a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediately sensing and attacking someone's weakest spot\".[3] As the Bulls organization built the franchise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not \"tough enough\" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time.[209]\n\n\nNoted as a durable player, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, when he injured his right knee.[13][210] Of the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 82 regular season games nine times.[13] Jordan has frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, and Jerry West as influences.[211][212] Confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, Jordan had a special \"Love of the Game Clause\" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.[213]\n\n\nJordan had a versatile offensive game and was capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate. His 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in NBA history.[214] As his career progressed, Jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to avoid block attempts. According to Hubie Brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable.[215] Despite media criticism by some as a selfish player early in his career, Jordan was willing to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 apg and a season-high of 8.0 apg.[46] For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rpg. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 spg and 0.8 bpg.[46]\n\n\nThree-point field goal was not Jordan's strength, especially in his early years. Later on in Jordan's career, he improved his three-point shooting, and finished his career with a respectable 32% success rate.[46] His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97.[13] Jordan's effective field goal percentage was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and second retirements, respectively, finishing his Chicago Bulls career with 31.5 points per game on 50.5 FG% shooting and his overall career with 49.7 FG% shooting.[13]\n\n\nUnlike NBA players often compared to Jordan, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, as he did not need to rely on the three-pointer in order to be effective on offense. Three-point shooting was only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamental aspect of the game until the first decades of the 21st century,[216] with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots.[217] Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during the playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting six consecutive three-point shots in Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. Jordan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons he shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 38.9%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in the playoffs during his championship runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point line reverted to the original line.[218][219][220]\n\n\nIn 1988, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year and the Most Valuable Player awards, becoming the first NBA player to win both awards in a career let alone season. In addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard,[221] and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks fourth in NBA history in total steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton, Jason Kidd and Chris Paul.[222] Jerry West often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.[223] Doc Rivers declared Jordan \"the best superstar defender in the history of the game\".[224]\n\n\nJordan was known to have strong eyesight. Broadcaster Al Michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69 cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15 m) away.[225] During the 2001 NBA Finals, Phil Jackson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating: \"Michael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that occasion.\"[226]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Michael Jordan](image) | This article is part of a series aboutMichael Jordan |\n\n |\n| Career\n* Career achievements\n* The Shot\n* Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals\n* 1982 NCAA Championship Game\n* Air Jordan (Jumpman)\n* Jordan Rules\n |\n| Family\n* James R.

In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time.[230] Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest among NBA career playoff scoring leaders.[231] He scored 32,292 points in the regular season,[232] placing him fifth on the NBA all-time scoring list behind LeBron James, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, and Bryant.[232]\n\n\nWith five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA record), and three NBA All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player in NBA history.[13][233] Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 10 times.[13] He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996,[234] and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[23] Jordan is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams).[235] Since 1976, the year of the ABA–NBA merger,[236] Jordan and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one team.[237] In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.[238]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Magic Johnson[5]\n\nMany of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.[223] In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century.[239] Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999 list of 20th century athletes.[240] In addition, the Associated Press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century.[241] Jordan has also appeared on the front cover of *Sports Illustrated* a record 50 times.[242] In the September 1996 issue of *Sport*, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.[243]\n\n\nJordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players.[244][245] Several NBA players, including James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered Jordan their role model while they were growing up.[246][247] In addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players \"the next Michael Jordan\" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade.[248][249][250] Some analysts, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NBA; for Devine, it \"inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers\", such as Russell Westbrook, James Harden, Luka Dončić, and James.[251] Don Nelson stated: \"I would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a rookie.\"[252]\n\n\nAlthough Jordan was a well-rounded player, his \"Air Jordan\" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players,[244] a fact Jordan himself has lamented, saying: \"I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really publicized.\"[244] During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.[253] The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title.[253] As late as 2022, NBA Finals television ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.[254]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 \"Dream Team\"; the exhibit also has a batting baseball glove to signify Jordan's short career in the Minor League Baseball.[255] After Jordan received word of his acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David Thompson to present him.[256] As Jordan would later explain during his induction speech in September 2009, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels when growing up in North Carolina but greatly admired Thompson, who played for the rival NC State Wolfpack. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč.[17] Dean Smith and Doug Collins, two of Jordan's former coaches, were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech when he began to cry was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the \"Crying Jordan\" Internet meme.[257][258] In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[27] In October 2021, Jordan was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[23] In September 2022, Jordan's jersey in which he played the opening game of the 1998 NBA Finals was sold for $10.1 million, making it the most expensive game-worn sports memorabilia in history.[259] In December 2022, the NBA unveiled a new MVP trophy, named in Jordan's honor, to be awarded beginning with the 2022–23 season. The \"Michael Jordan Trophy\" will replace the original trophy, named in honor of former NBA commissioner Maurice Podoloff, with a new Podoloff Trophy set to be awarded to the team with the best overall regular season record.[260][261]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of career achievements by Michael Jordan § NBA career statistics\n\nSee also: List of

He also promoted his Jordan Brand clothing line and rode motorcycles.[282] Since 2004, Jordan has owned Michael Jordan Motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two Suzukis in the premier Superbike championship sanctioned by the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) until the end of the 2013 season.[283][284]\n\n\n\n### Charlotte Bobcats/Hornets[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2006, Jordan bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats (known as the Hornets since 2013), becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner Robert L. Johnson. As part of the deal, Jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title Managing Member of Basketball Operations.[285][286] Despite Jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in Charlotte's marketing campaigns.[287] A decade earlier, Jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of Charlotte's original NBA team, the Charlotte Hornets, but talks collapsed when owner George Shinn refused to give Jordan complete control of basketball operations.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2010, it was reported that Jordan was seeking majority ownership of the Bobcats.[289] As February wore on, it became apparent that Jordan and former Houston Rockets president George Postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. On February 27, the Bobcats announced that Johnson had reached an agreement with Jordan and his group, MJ Basketball Holdings, to buy the team from Johnson pending NBA approval.[290] On March 17, the NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA team.[291] It also made him the league's only African-American majority owner.[292]\n\n\nDuring the 2011 NBA lockout, *The New York Times* wrote that Jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. Journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, Jordan had told Washington Wizards then-owner Abe Pollin: \"If you can't make a profit, you should sell your team.\"[293] Jason Whitlock of FoxSports.com called Jordan \"a hypocrite sellout who can easily betray the very people who made him a billionaire global icon\" for wanting \"current players to pay for his incompetence\".[294] He cited Jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players Kwame Brown and Adam Morrison.[294]\n\n\nDuring the 2011–12 NBA season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the Bobcats posted a 7–59 record. The team closed out the season with a 23-game losing streak; their .106 winning percentage was the worst in NBA history.[295] Before the next season, Jordan said: \"I'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. It's very, very frustrating.\"[296]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 NBA offseason, Jordan sold a minority piece of the Hornets to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself,[297] as well as the role of chairman.[298] In 2023, Jordan finalized the sale of his majority stake of the team to Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall, ending his 13-year tenure as majority owner of the Hornets, although he is keeping a minority stake.[299] The sale was officially completed in August 2023 for approximately $3 billion, more than 10 times the $275 million Jordan had paid for the team.[300]\n\n\n\n### 23XI Racing[edit]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2020, Jordan and NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin announced they would be fielding a NASCAR Cup Series team with Bubba Wallace driving, beginning competition in the 2021 season.[301] On October 22, the team's name was confirmed to be 23XI Racing (pronounced twenty-three eleven) and the team's entry would bear No. 23.[302] After the team's inaugural season, it added a second car with No. 45, driven by Kurt Busch in 2022 and Tyler Reddick in 2023.[303][304] Ty Gibbs, John Hunter Nemechek, and Daniel Hemric also drove for 23XI as substitute drivers during the 2022 season.[305][306][307] The team fielded a third car, No. 67, driven by Travis Pastrana in the 2023 Daytona 500.[308] 23XI Racing has won four races, two by Wallace, one by Busch, and one by Reddick.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House\nJordan's nephew through his brother Larry, Justin Jordan, played NCAA Division I basketball for the UNC Greensboro Spartans and is a scout for the Charlotte Hornets.[311][312]\n\n\nJordan married Juanita Vanoy at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas on September 2, 1989.[313][314] They had two sons, Jeffrey and Marcus, and a daughter, Jasmine.[315] The Jordans filed for divorce on January 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. They again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on December 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made \"mutually and amicably\".[316][317] It is reported that Juanita received a $168 million settlement (equivalent to $254 million in 2023), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.[318][319]\n\n\nIn 1991, Jordan purchased a lot in Highland Park, Illinois, where he planned to build a 56,000-square-foot (5,200 m2) mansion. It was completed in 1995. He listed the mansion for sale in 2012.[320] He also owns homes in North Carolina and Jupiter Island, Florida.[321]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2006, a judge in Cook County, Illinois, determined that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5 million in a breach of contract claim.[322] Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret.[323][324][325] Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5 million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991; a DNA test showed Jordan was not the father of the child.[322]\n\n\nJordan proposed to his longtime girlfriend, Cuban-American model Yvette Prieto, on Christmas 2011,[326] and they were married on April 27, 2013, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church.[327][328] It was announced on November 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together.[329][330] On February 11, 2014, Prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named Victoria and Ysabel.[331] In 2019, Jordan became a grandfather when his daughter Jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is professional basketball player Rakeem Christmas.[332]\n\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jordan in 2008\nJordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI.[333] Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the \"Be Like Mike\" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.[333][334]\n\n\nNike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984.[335] One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon. In the commercials, Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that \"it's gotta be the shoes\".[333] The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of \"shoe-jackings\", in which people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently, Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the \"Jordan Brand\". The company features a list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.[336][337] The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of North Carolina, UCLA, California, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgetown, and Marquette.[338][339]\n\n\nJordan also has been associated with the Looney Tunes cartoon characters. A Nike commercial shown during 1992's Super Bowl XXVI featured Jordan and Bugs Bunny playing basketball.[340] The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film *Space Jam*, which starred Jordan and Bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball.[341] They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.[341] Jordan also made an appearance in the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Jam\" (1992).[342]\n\n\nSince 2008, Jordan's yearly income from endorsements is estimated to be over $40 million.[343][344] In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the Bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games.[345] Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of US$30 million per season.[346] An academic study found that Jordan's first NBA comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1 billion.[347]\n\n\nMost of Jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, David Falk.[348] Jordan has described Falk as \"the best at what he does\" and that \"marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan'.\"[349]\n\n\n\n### Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2010, Jordan was ranked by *Forbes* as the 20th-most-powerful celebrity in the world, with $55 million earned between June 2009 and June 2010. According to *Forbes*, Jordan Brand generates $1 billion in sales for Nike.[350] In June 2014, Jordan was named the first NBA player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the Charlotte Hornets from 80% to 89.5%.[351][352] On January 20, 2015, Jordan was honored with the *Charlotte Business Journal'*s Business Person of the Year for 2014.[353] In 2017, he became a part owner of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball.[354]\n\n\n*Forbes* designated Jordan as the athlete with the highest career earnings in 2017.[355] From his Jordan Brand income and endorsements, Jordan's 2015 income was an estimated $110 million, the most of any retired athlete.[356] As of 2023[update], his net worth is estimated at $3 billion by *Forbes*,[28] making him the fifth-richest African-American, behind Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Rihanna.[357]\n\n\nJordan co-owns an automotive group which bears his name. The company has a Nissan dealership in Durham, North Carolina, acquired in 1990,[358] and formerly had a Lincoln–Mercury dealership from 1995 until its closure in June 2009.[359][360] The company also owned a Nissan franchise in Glen Burnie, Maryland.[359] The restaurant industry is another business interest of Jordan's. Restaurants he has owned include a steakhouse in New York City's Grand Central Terminal, among others;[361] that restaurant closed in 2018.[362] Jordan is the majority investor in a golf course, Grove XXIII, under construction in Hobe Sound, Florida.[363]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Jordan became an investor and advisor for DraftKings.[364]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2014, Jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational, that raised money for various charities.[365] In 2006, Jordan and his wife Juanita pledged $5 million to Chicago's Hales Franciscan High School.[366] The Jordan Brand has made donations to Habitat for Humanity and a Louisiana branch of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.[367]\n\n\nThe Make-A-Wish Foundation named Jordan its Chief Wish Ambassador in 2008.[365] In 2013, he granted his 200th wish for the organization.[368] As of 2019, he has raised more than $5 million for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.[365] In 2023, Jordan donated $10 million to the organization for his 60th birthday.[369]\n\n\nIn 2015, Jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different Chicago charities.[370] In 2017, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, North Carolina, by giving $7 million, the biggest donation he had made at the time.[371] In 2018, after Hurricane Florence damaged parts of North Carolina, including his former hometown of Wilmington, Jordan donated $2 million to relief efforts.[372] He gave $1 million to aid the Bahamas' recovery following Hurricane Dorian in 2019.[373]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2020, in the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd, Jordan and his brand announced in a joint statement that they would be donating $100 million over the next 10 years to organizations dedicated to \"ensuring racial equality, social justice and greater access to education\".[374] In February 2021, Jordan funded two Novant Health Michael Jordan Family Clinics in New Hanover County, North Carolina, by giving $10 million.[375][376]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nJordan played himself in the 1996 comedy film *Space Jam*. The film received mixed reviews,[377] but it was a box office success, making $230 million worldwide, and earned more than $1 billion through merchandise sales.[378]\n\n\nIn 2000, Jordan was the subject of an IMAX documentary about his career with the Chicago Bulls, especially the 1998 NBA playoffs, titled *Michael Jordan to the Max*.[379] Two decades later, the same period of Jordan's life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning *The Last Dance*, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESPN in April and May 2020. *The Last Dance* relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's and his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew had shot over the course of the 1997–98 NBA season for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used.[380][381] He was interviewed at three homes associated with the production and did not want cameras in his home or on his plane, as according to director Jason Hehir \"there are certain aspects of his life that he wants to keep private\".[382]\n\n\nJordan granted rapper Travis Scott permission to film a music video for his single \"Franchise\" at his home in Highland Park, Illinois.[383] Jordan appeared in the 2022 miniseries *The Captain*, which follows the life and career of Derek Jeter.[384]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nJordan has authored several books focusing on his life, basketball career, and world view.\n\n\n\n* *Rare Air: Michael on Michael*, with Mark Vancil and Walter Iooss (Harper San Francisco, 1993).[385][386]\n* *I Can't Accept Not Trying: Michael Jordan on the Pursuit of Excellence*, with Mark Vancil and Sandro Miller (Harper San Francisco, 1994).[387]\n* *For the Love of the Game: My Story*, with Mark Vancil (Crown Publishers, 1998).[388]\n* *Driven from Within*, with Mark Vancil (Atria Books, 2005).[389]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes\n* List of athletes who came out of retirement\n* List of NBA teams by single season win percentage\n* Michael Jordan's Restaurant\n* *Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City*\n* *Michael Jordan in Flight*\n* *NBA 2K11*\n* *NBA 2K12*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Jordan's weight fluctuated from 195 to 218 lb (88 to 99 kg) during the course of his professional career;[1][2][3] his NBA listed weight was 216 lb (98 kg).[4][5][6]\n2. **^** Jordan wore a nameless No. 12 jersey in a February 14, 1990, game against the Orlando Magic because his No. 23 jersey had been stolen.[7] Jordan scored 49 points, setting a franchise record for players wearing that jersey number.[8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Telander, Rick (February 14, 2018). \"Michael Jordan Put on a Helluva Show at '88 All-Star Weekend\". *Slam*.

Jordan's return from three years of retirement has been remarkable, with five 40-point performances already. He is also rebounding and handing out assists on par with his career averages.

Nicknamed \"**the Mailman**\", he is considered one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.[2] Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985–2003) in the NBA with the Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John Stockton. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, a 14-time NBA All-Star, and an 11-time member of the All-NBA first team. His 36,928 career points scored rank third all-time in NBA history behind LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and he holds the records for most free throws made and attempted, and most regular season games started, in addition to being tied for the second-most first-team All-NBA selections with Kobe Bryant and behind LeBron James.[3]\n\n\nMalone played college basketball at Louisiana Tech University. In his three seasons with Louisiana Tech, he helped the Bulldogs basketball team to its first-ever NCAA tournament in 1984 and to first place in the Southland Conference in 1985. The Utah Jazz selected him in the first round of the 1985 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick. Malone appeared in the playoffs every season in his career, including the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998 with the Jazz. He played his final season with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he played his third Finals in 2004. Malone also competed with the United States national team in the Summer Olympic Games of 1992 and 1996; in both years he won gold medals. In 1996, as part of the NBA's 50th Anniversary, Malone was honored as one of the 50 greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team.[4] In October 2021, Malone was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[5]\n\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Malone joined the staff of the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team in 2007 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010 twice – for his individual career, and as a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and college[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Summerfield, Louisiana,[2] Malone was the youngest of nine children and was raised on a farm by his single mother, Shirley. Shedrick Hay, his father, was married to a different woman and raising a family with her. Shedrick committed suicide when Karl was 14,[7] though Malone didn't disclose the suicide until 1994. As a child, Malone often worked on the farm, chopped trees, hunted, and fished. He attended Summerfield High School and led his basketball team to three consecutive Louisiana Class C titles from 1979 to his senior season in 1981.\n\n\nAlthough recruited by University of Arkansas basketball coach Eddie Sutton, Malone enrolled at Louisiana Tech University, which was closer to home. He joined the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team in his second year because his grades were too low for freshman eligibility; Malone played under coach Andy Russo.[8] In his second season with Louisiana Tech (1983–84), Malone averaged 18.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game.[8][9] Louisiana Tech finished the 1984–85 season 29–3, at the top of the Southland Conference, and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history; the team finished at the Sweet 16 round.[10] In each of his three seasons with the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, Malone was an All-Southland selection.[8]\n\n\n\n## NBA career[edit]\n\n\n### Utah Jazz (1985–2003)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years (1985–1987)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1985 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz selected Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick. According to Malone's official NBA biography: \"If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.\"[11] In fact, Malone was so convinced the Dallas Mavericks were going to select him with the eighth choice that he had already rented an apartment in Dallas. Instead, the Mavericks selected Detlef Schrempf.[12] Under head coach Frank Layden, Malone averaged 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds in his first season and made the 1986 NBA All-Rookie Team after coming in third for Rookie of the Year votes.[11] On January 14, 1986, the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 105–102 to snap the Rockets' 20-game winning streak at home. Malone scored 29 points in that game, including four free throws followed by a three-pointer by Pace Mannion to rally from a 96–89 deficit with 5 minutes and 36 seconds remaining to a 96–96 tie.[13] For the third consecutive season, the Jazz made the postseason but lost the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks. In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9). After his second season, Malone became the Jazz's leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game.[11]\n\n\n\n#### All-Star and team offense leader (1987–1996)[edit]\n\n\nBy the 1987–88 season, Malone was the foundation of the offense and John Stockton was the floor general. Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season. This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone.[11] In the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points.[14] The Jazz finished 47–35, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round.[15] In the next round, the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, led by perennial All-Stars Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Jazz in seven games. In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109–98 and eventually won the 1988 NBA Finals. In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malone circa 1988\nMalone signed a 10-year contract during the 1988 offseason worth $18 million.[14] In December 1988, Jerry Sloan succeeded Layden as head coach as Layden became team president.[16] Malone averaged 29.1 points in 1988–89, good for second in the NBA behind Michael Jordan, and 10.7 rebounds, which was fifth in the league.[17] This scoring average was Malone's highest so far in his career. At the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, Malone finished with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists en route to his first NBA All-Star MVP. The Jazz finished 51–31, but were swept in three games in the first round by the Golden State Warriors. This season marked Malone's first with the All-NBA First Team honor.[11]\n\n\nDuring the 1989–90, Malone increased his scoring to 31 points and his rebounding to 11.1 a game and again was selected to the All-NBA First Team.[11] In the first game of the season, Malone recorded 40 points, 16 rebounds and 5 assists in a 122–113 win over the Denver Nuggets.[18] On December 5, 1989, Malone scored 21 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a 94–80 win over the home team, Cleveland Cavaliers.[19] Seventeen days later, Malone recorded 52 points and 17 rebounds in a 114-100 road win over the Charlotte Hornets.[20] On January 27, 1990, Malone scored a career-high 61 points in a 144–96 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[21] He made 21 of 26 field goals and 19 of 23 free throws.[22] It was the most points scored by a Jazz player since the team moved to Utah from New Orleans. Although Malone was voted to the NBA All-Star Game for the third consecutive season, because of an ankle injury he sat out the game.[23] He led the team in scoring in 24 of the last 26 games of the season; on March 29, 1990, against the Golden State Warriors, Malone scored 49 points, and on April 12 against the Lakers he scored 45. The Jazz, finishing the season 55–27, lost to the Phoenix Suns within five games in the first round of the playoffs, in which Malone averaged 25.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. For the second straight season, Malone finished second in the league in points per game behind Michael Jordan.[11]\n\n\nFrom January 19 to March 4, 1991, Malone led the Jazz in scoring for 19 straight games; after starting the 1990–91 season 7–8 the team went 21–9 in January and February 1991. Malone scored 16 points and took 11 rebounds in the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance for the West, and averaged 29.0 points and 11.8 rebounds each regular-season game. He was among four Jazz players with double-figure scoring averages, the others being the newly acquired Jeff Malone (no relation) as well as John Stockton and Thurl Bailey. In four games, the Jazz eliminated the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1991 playoffs but lost to the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round. Malone made the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive season.[11]\n\n\nAs he had done in 1989–90, Malone finished the 1991–92 season second in the league in scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.[11] It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the 1992 NBA Playoffs, the team made the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.[24] Malone scored 40 or more points in five games this season.[11] Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a flagrant foul. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the Detroit Pistons, Malone elbowed the Pistons' Isiah Thomas on the forehead. Thomas needed 40 stitches over his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000.[25] In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz lost in the playoffs for the second straight season to the Portland Trail Blazers. Malone averaged 29.1 points on 52.1% shooting and 11.9 rebounds in the 1992 playoffs.[11]\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Malone put up stellar numbers: in 1992–93, he averaged 27.0 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds in 1993–94, 26.7 points and 10.6 rebounds in 1994–95, and 25.7 points and 9.8 rebounds in 1995–96.[26] Following the 1992 Summer Olympics in which Malone helped the American national team, dubbed the \"Dream Team\", win a gold medal, Malone expressed opposition to Magic Johnson, who had recently tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA in 1991, making a comeback to the league. Malone's point of view diverged from the support for Johnson from his Olympic and Los Angeles Lakers teammates, and the NBA implemented AIDS-related precautions after Johnson's revelation.[27] On February 4, 1993, in a game against the Lakers, Malone surpassed 16,000 career points. He and his teammate John Stockton shared the All-Star MVP award in 1993. In the West's 135–132 overtime win, Malone scored 28 points and pulled in 10 rebounds.[11]\n\n\nMalone started all 82 games of 1993–94 and helped the Jazz make the Western Conference Finals for the second time in franchise history and his career. In his ninth season, Malone led the Jazz in scoring (25.2), rebounding (11.5), and blocked shots (126), made 49.7% of field goal attempts, and played 3,329 minutes, the second-most that season in the league behind Latrell Sprewell's 3,533.[11] On March 29, 1994, Malone recorded a career-high 23 rebounds, but the Jazz lost to the Golden State Warriors 116–113. However, Malone made only 8 of 29 field goals that night and commented post-game: \"My rebounds are not going to be tomorrow's headline...Tomorrow's headline is going to be all those easy shots I missed.\"[28] The eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets eliminated the Jazz from the Western Conference Finals in five games.[11] Although Malone scored 32 points in the Jazz' 104–99 Game 2 loss, along with Stockton's 18, they and the Jazz were no match for the Rockets with high-scoring center Hakeem Olajuwon. Midway into the fourth quarter, Malone and Olajuwon scored on four consecutive possessions by their teams, leading up to a 93–93 tie.[29]\n\n\nFor the first time in team history, in 1994–95, the Utah Jazz won 60 games. In addition, the team won 15 consecutive away games (the best such streak by the team, then the second-best streak in the league). Malone's 26.7 points per game ranked fourth in the NBA, and Malone became the 19th NBA player to reach 20,000 career points on January 20, 1995. In the 1995 playoffs, the Jazz lost to the Houston Rockets for the second consecutive year, this time in the first round.[11] The Rockets became NBA champions for the second straight season.\n\n\nOn January 13, 1996, Malone renewed his contract with the Jazz.[26] The Jazz only made it as far as the Western Conference Finals in this period, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers (1992), the Houston Rockets (1994) and the Seattle SuperSonics (1996).\n\n\n\n#### Western Conference championship years (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone in 1997\nMalone returned from a gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. During the 1996–97 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64–18 record, the most regular-season wins in team history. Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference.[8][30] After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Clyde Drexler. The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls won the first two games at the United Center. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2. However, the Jazz won the next two games at the Delta Center behind Malone's 37 points in Game 3 and 23 in Game 4, including a game-winning fastbreak lay-up off a spectacular assist by Stockton in the last minute. The Bulls won the next two games and the series, with Malone struggling from the foul line in Game 6.\n\n\nThe next season saw the Jazz once again dominate. Malone put up 27 points per game and just missed out on his second MVP award, losing to Jordan. Nevertheless, the Jazz posted a 62–20 record, which was the best in the NBA. The Jazz once again were seated at the top of the Western Conference, and in the 1998 playoffs they defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Lakers via a sweep en route to their second consecutive Finals appearance. The rematch with the Chicago Bulls would start differently, as Malone put up 21 points and the Jazz won Game 1, 88–85. Malone found himself unable to put up consistently high numbers, due in large part to the swarming defense of defenders Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen. In Game 5 of the 1998 Finals, Malone led the Jazz in scoring with 39 points, and the Jazz beat the Bulls 83–81 in Chicago. Malone scored his 39 points on 17-for-27 shooting and also made 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 turnover. Many of his shots were \"mid-range turnaround jumpers from the left side\".[31]\n\n\nA sixth game of the Finals was held at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, and by trailing the series 3–2 the team was one loss away from losing the series.[32] Malone scored 31 points and made 11 rebounds. Although the Jazz held leads of 49–45 by halftime and 66–61 after the third quarter, the team squandered their lead in the fourth and would lose after Malone lost a pass in the post.[33] With 18.9 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Jazz leading 86–85, Bulls guard/forward Michael Jordan stole the ball just passed to Malone and with 5.2 seconds left made a jump shot that gave the Bulls an 87–86 lead. John Stockton missed a game-winning jump shot. Jordan's shot has been dubbed the \"greatest shot\" of his career, and the Bulls' 1998 title was their third consecutive championship and sixth since 1991.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Later seasons with Jazz (1998–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 12, 1998, during the lockout that shortened the 1998–99 season, Malone declared on his Los Angeles-based radio show that he would demand a trade from the Jazz after the end of the lockout, citing a lack of respect from the team owner Larry H. Miller and the Utah media, which he dubbed \"goons\".[35] A week later, Malone backed off on his trade demands, stating in an interview that he would still love to play for the Jazz with \"everything else being equal\".[36] The NBA regular season resumed in February and Malone won his second MVP award, with the Jazz going 37–13 during the 50-game regular season. They lost in the second round that year to the Trail Blazers, and for the next several years the Jazz fell out of title contention. The Jazz won Game 5 of the second-round 1999 round against the Blazers 88–71 to force a sixth game, and Malone scored 23 points. In that game, Malone elbowed the Blazers' Brian Grant, something he also did in Game 1 and for which he was fined $10,000.[37] Despite the decline of his team and his advancing age, Malone averaged 25.5, 23.2, 22.4, and 20.6 points per game in his last four seasons with Utah. In the 2002–2003 season, Malone passed Wilt Chamberlain for second on the all-time scoring list with 36,374 points. He became a free agent in 2003, the year Stockton had retired. For the time Malone and Stockton played together on the Jazz (1985–2003), the two formed one of the most productive guard–forward combinations in NBA history.[*citation needed*] Playing coach Jerry Sloan's scrappy and tough style and perfecting the pick and roll to a maximum degree of efficiency, the Jazz regularly made the playoffs with a winning record. Malone led the Jazz to multiple 50-win seasons with the exception of 1992–93 (47–35).\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone with the Lakers\nMalone played in the NBA for one more season, joining the Los Angeles Lakers in an attempt to win a championship. All-Star point guard Gary Payton also joined the Lakers in an attempt to win his first NBA championship, and with Malone, Payton, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were favorites to win the title. The Lakers rolled out to a dominant 18–3 start to the season, but on December 21, Malone suffered a knee injury against the Phoenix Suns that forced him to miss 39 games. Malone returned by the season's end, as the Lakers entered the playoffs with 56 wins and the number 2 seed in the playoffs. In the first round against the Houston Rockets, Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers' game 4 victory. The Lakers advanced to face the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against Tim Duncan, despite not scoring more than 13 points in any game during the series. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 6 games in the conference semifinals before defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in 6 games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals. He scored 17 points on two occasions against Minnesota and averaged 11.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game in the playoffs.\n\n\nThe 40-year-old Malone's quest to win an NBA championship failed as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Malone sprained his right knee in game three and played injured in games three and four before missing the fifth and final game of the series.\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nAfter his season with the Lakers, Malone became a free agent. He had knee surgery during the summer of 2004, and personal problems[38] with Lakers guard Kobe Bryant[39] prompted Malone not to return for another season with the team. The New York Knicks sought to sign Malone for 2004–05.[40] In early February 2005, prior to the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, Malone's agent speculated that Malone would sign with the San Antonio Spurs.[41] Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich confirmed his team was interested in signing Malone, should he decide to play one more season.[42]\n\n\nAt a press conference on February 13, 2005, at the Delta Center, Malone officially announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons.[43]\n\n\nThe Utah Jazz retired Malone's jersey number 32 on March 23, 2006, when the Jazz hosted the Washington Wizards. He was also honored with the unveiling of a bronze statue outside the EnergySolutions Arena next to teammate John Stockton, and the renaming of a portion of 100 South in Salt Lake City in his honor. The location where the statues stand is now the intersection of Stockton and Malone.[44]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, Malone and Stockton were both cut from the United States men's national basketball team but joined the team in 1992, when national basketball teams welcomed NBA players. Prior to that only professionals from leagues other than the NBA were allowed to compete, and that greatly disadvantaged the United States.[45]\n\n\nThe Oregon National Guard made Malone an honorary member after the U.S. national team beat the Venezuelan team 127–80 in the gold-medal game of the 1992 Olympic qualifier tournament.[46]\n\n\nMalone played in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics and won gold medals with the US team both years. In the 1996 Olympics, Malone averaged 8.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game and made 56.9% of two-point field goal attempts and 52.9% of free-throw attempts.[47] In 2010, he was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame along with the rest of the original Dream Team.[48]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Louisiana Tech (2007–2011)[edit]\n\n\nOn May 31, 2007, Malone became director of basketball promotion and assistant strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater Louisiana Tech University and donated $350,000 to the university athletic department.[49]\n\n\nOn May 29, 2013, Malone returned to the Utah Jazz to work as a big man coach.[50]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone's statue outside the Vivint Arena\nMalone is regarded as one of the best power forwards in the history of the NBA and was known as \"the Mailman\" for his consistent delivery.[14] He collected two regular-season MVP Awards, eleven NBA First Team nominations and was also selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team three times. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Malone as the 16th greatest player in NBA history.[51]\n\n\nMalone led the NBA in free throws taken and made a league-record seven times.[*citation needed*] He was a physical defender and rebounder, and one of the most durable players ever in the NBA. He maintained a high level of play even at age 40, becoming the oldest player to both log a triple-double and to be a starter on an NBA Finals-bound team. Malone's work ethic showed prominently in his formative years in the NBA, when he raised his free throw shooting percentage from below 50% to 75%.\n\n\nMalone wore number 32 for the Utah Jazz. He wore number 11 for the Los Angeles Lakers (number 32 was retired honoring Magic Johnson, though Johnson himself offered to have it unretired for Malone to wear, an offer Malone declined), though he was photographed with a number 32 jersey at his Lakers introductory press conference. Malone also wore number 11 for the Dream Team, as the players wore 4 to 15 to adhere to FIBA rules.\n\n\nOver 1,476 NBA games (sixth all-time), and 1,471 starts (most all-time, never coming off the bench after his rookie season), Malone scored 36,928 points (25.0 per game), third-best all-time, on .516 shooting. His high field goal percentage benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton.[*citation needed*] Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all-time for two players on the same team, and missed just ten games out of a possible 1,444 games during his time with the Jazz (three because of suspension).\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  ‡ \n | NBA record\n |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985–86 | Utah | 81 | 76 | 30.6 | .496 | .000 | .481 | 8.9 | 2.9 | 1.3 | 0.5 | 14.9\n |\n| 1986–87 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 34.8 | .512 | .000 | .598 | 10.4 | 1.9 | 1.3 | 0.7 | 21.7\n |\n| 1987–88 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 39.0 | .520 | .000 | .700 | **12.0** | 2.4 | 1.4 | 0.6 | 27.7\n |\n| 1988–89 | Utah | 80 | 80 | 39.1 | .519 | .313 | .766 | 10.7 | 2.7 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 29.1\n |\n| 1989–90 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 38.1 | **.562** | .372 | .762 | 11.1 | 2.8 | 1.5 | 0.6 | **31.0** |\n| 1990–91 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 40.3 | .527 | .286 | .770 | 11.8 | 3.3 | 1.1 | 1.0 | 29.0\n |\n| 1991–92 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 37.7 | .526 | .176 | .778 | 11.2 | 3.0 | 1.3 | 0.6 | 28.0\n |\n| 1992–93 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 37.8 | .552 | .200 | .740 | 11.2 | 3.8 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 27.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | **40.6** | .497 | .250 | .694 | 11.5 | 4.0 | 1.5 | **1.5** | 25.2\n |\n| 1994–95 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 38.1 | .536 | .268 | .742 | 10.6 | 3.5 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 26.7\n |\n| 1995–96 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 38.0 | .519 | **.400** | .723 | 9.8 | 4.2 | 1.7 | 0.7 | 25.7\n |\n| 1996–97 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 36.6 | .550 | .000 | .755 | 9.9 | 4.5 | 1.4 | 0.6 | 27.4\n |\n| 1997–98 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .530 | .333 | .761 | 10.3 | 3.9 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 27.0\n |\n| 1998–99 | Utah | 49 | 49 | 37.4 | .493 | .000 | .788 | 9.4 | 4.1 | 1.3 | 0.6 | 23.8\n |\n| 1999–00 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 35.9 | .509 | .250 | **.797** | 9.5 | 3.7 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 25.5\n |\n| 2000–01 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 35.7 | .498 | **.400** | .793 | 8.3 | 4.5 | 1.1 | 0.8 | 23.2\n |\n| 2001–02 | Utah | 80 | 80 | 38.0 | .454 | .360 | **.797** | 8.6 | 4.3 | **1.9** | 0.7 | 22.4\n |\n| 2002–03 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 36.2 | .462 | .214 | .763 | 7.8 | **4.7** | 1.7 | 0.4 | 20.6\n |\n| 2003–04 | L.A.

Karl Malone Toyota is in the Salt Lake City suburb of Draper, Utah, while Karl Malone Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram is in Heber City, Utah. Malone previously co-owned a Toyota dealership in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with Larry H. Miller Dealerships, but sold his share in 2010. He also co-owned a Honda dealership in Sandy, Utah, with John Stockton, but sold his share, again to Larry H. Miller Dealerships, in 2010. In 2019, he bought a Toyota dealership in Ruston, Louisiana, now called Karl Malone Toyota of Ruston.\n\n\nMalone also owns three Jiffy Lube franchises in Utah, and is a part owner of Burger King franchises in Utah and Idaho.[52]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nMalone starred in the 1994 film *Rockwell* as a member of Porter Rockwell's team.[54] He had a guest appearance as himself and as a superhero named \"Pulverizer\" in the *Static Shock* episode \"Hoop Squad\".[55] Malone also made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2004 comedy film *Soul Plane* and appears in an episode of *Brother's Keeper* from 1998.[56] He also has a recurring role in a skit called \"All Alone with Karl Malone\" on the television series *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*.[57]\n\n\n\n### Professional wrestling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone with Diamond Dallas Page in 1998\nAfter the 1998 NBA Finals, Malone and Chicago Bulls power forward Dennis Rodman participated in a professional wrestling match in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at their Bash at the Beach event in July 1998. Malone, a wrestling fan, teamed with his friend, Diamond Dallas Page, against Rodman and Hulk Hogan.[58][59] In a poorly received match by some wrestling critics, the two power forwards exchanged \"rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines\" for 23 minutes.[60] Malone and DDP lost to Rodman and Hogan. The event was a massive financial success for the company, drawing the highest pay-per-view buyrate of 1998 and one of the highest in the company's history.[61]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nChildren of Karl Malone\n* By Bonita Ford\n\t+ Cheryl (born 1981)\n\t+ Daryl (born 1981)\n* By Gloria Bell\n\t+ Demetress (born 1984)\n* By Kay Kinsey\n\t+ Kadee (born 1991)\n\t+ Kylee (born 1993)\n\t+ Karl, Jr. (born 1995)\n\t+ Karlee (born 1998)\n\nMalone married Kay Kinsey, winner of the 1988 Miss Idaho USA pageant, on December 24, 1990.[62] They have four children: daughter Kadee (born November 8, 1991),[63] daughter Kylee (born April 7, 1993), son Karl Jr. \"K.J.\" (born May 8, 1995), and daughter Karlee (born 1998).[62] K.J. played football at LSU,[64] and was invited to the 2018 NFL Combine.[65]\n\n\nIn 1998, the tabloid newspaper *The Globe* reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s. The newspaper alleged that he was the father of three children: two by Bonita Ford, a woman approximately his age from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana, and one with Gloria Bell, who was 13 when she gave birth. Malone and Ford were both 17 when twins Daryl and Cheryl Ford were born;[66] Malone was a 20-year-old college sophomore when Bell, at age 13, gave birth to Demetress Bell.[67] In the aftermath of the *Globe* story, Malone met the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born.[68] Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and his attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits before any conclusive establishment of paternity and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.\n\n\nThe *Tribune* confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. The paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One item listed was a laboratory blood test that concluded with over 99% certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying the same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone.[69][70] According to the *Tribune*, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case of the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.[69]\n\n\nBy the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone said publicly that the twins were members of the Malone family.[71] Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater, Louisiana Tech. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association.\n\n\nBell has played as an NFL offensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles, and Dallas Cowboys. In 2008, *The Buffalo News* reported that Bell's first ever meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him then that it was \"too late\" for them to have a father-son relationship.[72] However, in 2014, the two repaired their relationship and were in regular contact by 2018.[73]\n\n\nIn 2018, Malone said about his relationship with his older children, \"I didn't handle it right; I was wrong. ... Father Time is the biggest thief that's out there, and you can't get that back.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMalone donated $4,000 to the 2004 reelection campaign of President George W. Bush and $2,000 to the 2004 U.S. Senate campaign of Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. In 2002, Malone donated $1,000 to the campaign of incumbent U.S. Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat representing Utah's 2nd congressional district.[74] Malone appeared on the \"Great American Panel\" segment of the Fox News talk show *Hannity* in March 2009. He advocated support for farmers in Louisiana who were about to lose their jobs due to the closing of Pilgrim's Pride plants.[75]\n\n\nMalone has served on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), a national firearms advocacy organization in the USA.[76]\n\n\n\n### Outdoor life[edit]\n\n\nMalone is an avid hunter and fisherman.[73] He owns a summer home near the Kenai River in Alaska.[77] In July 1998, Malone joined his Jazz teammates Chris Morris and Bryon Russell, some family members, corporate leadership of Q-Lube, and winners of a Q-Lube contest for a four-day fishing trip to Alaska.[78]\n\n\n\n### Public image[edit]\n\n\nMalone is known for frequently referring to himself in the third person.[79]\n\n\nHe has also appeared in television commercials for LA Gear sneakers,[80] Starter,[81] Morris Air Service,[82] Upper Deck,[83] and Burger King.[84]\n\n\nA cereal dedicated to him, MVP Flakes, was produced in 2000.[85]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career games played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association players with 50 or more points in a playoff game\n* List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\n* List of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Karl Malone Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

Nicknamed \"**the Mailman**\", he is considered one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.[2] Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985–2003) in the NBA with the Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John Stockton. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, a 14-time NBA All-Star, and an 11-time member of the All-NBA first team. His 36,928 career points scored rank third all-time in NBA history behind LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and he holds the records for most free throws made and attempted, and most regular season games started, in addition to being tied for the second-most first-team All-NBA selections with Kobe Bryant and behind LeBron James.[3]\n\n\nMalone played college basketball at Louisiana Tech University. In his three seasons with Louisiana Tech, he helped the Bulldogs basketball team to its first-ever NCAA tournament in 1984 and to first place in the Southland Conference in 1985. The Utah Jazz selected him in the first round of the 1985 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick. Malone appeared in the playoffs every season in his career, including the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998 with the Jazz. He played his final season with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he played his third Finals in 2004. Malone also competed with the United States national team in the Summer Olympic Games of 1992 and 1996; in both years he won gold medals. In 1996, as part of the NBA's 50th Anniversary, Malone was honored as one of the 50 greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team.[4] In October 2021, Malone was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[5]\n\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, Malone joined the staff of the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team in 2007 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010 twice – for his individual career, and as a member of the 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and college[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Summerfield, Louisiana,[2] Malone was the youngest of nine children and was raised on a farm by his single mother, Shirley. Shedrick Hay, his father, was married to a different woman and raising a family with her. Shedrick committed suicide when Karl was 14,[7] though Malone didn't disclose the suicide until 1994. As a child, Malone often worked on the farm, chopped trees, hunted, and fished. He attended Summerfield High School and led his basketball team to three consecutive Louisiana Class C titles from 1979 to his senior season in 1981.\n\n\nAlthough recruited by University of Arkansas basketball coach Eddie Sutton, Malone enrolled at Louisiana Tech University, which was closer to home. He joined the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team in his second year because his grades were too low for freshman eligibility; Malone played under coach Andy Russo.[8] In his second season with Louisiana Tech (1983–84), Malone averaged 18.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game.[8][9] Louisiana Tech finished the 1984–85 season 29–3, at the top of the Southland Conference, and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history; the team finished at the Sweet 16 round.[10] In each of his three seasons with the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, Malone was an All-Southland selection.[8]\n\n\n\n## NBA career[edit]\n\n\n### Utah Jazz (1985–2003)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years (1985–1987)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1985 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz selected Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick. According to Malone's official NBA biography: \"If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.\"[11] In fact, Malone was so convinced the Dallas Mavericks were going to select him with the eighth choice that he had already rented an apartment in Dallas. Instead, the Mavericks selected Detlef Schrempf.[12] Under head coach Frank Layden, Malone averaged 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds in his first season and made the 1986 NBA All-Rookie Team after coming in third for Rookie of the Year votes.[11] On January 14, 1986, the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 105–102 to snap the Rockets' 20-game winning streak at home. Malone scored 29 points in that game, including four free throws followed by a three-pointer by Pace Mannion to rally from a 96–89 deficit with 5 minutes and 36 seconds remaining to a 96–96 tie.[13] For the third consecutive season, the Jazz made the postseason but lost the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks. In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9). After his second season, Malone became the Jazz's leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game.[11]\n\n\n\n#### All-Star and team offense leader (1987–1996)[edit]\n\n\nBy the 1987–88 season, Malone was the foundation of the offense and John Stockton was the floor general. Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season. This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone.[11] In the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points.[14] The Jazz finished 47–35, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round.[15] In the next round, the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, led by perennial All-Stars Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Jazz in seven games. In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109–98 and eventually won the 1988 NBA Finals. In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malone circa 1988\nMalone signed a 10-year contract during the 1988 offseason worth $18 million.[14] In December 1988, Jerry Sloan succeeded Layden as head coach as Layden became team president.[16] Malone averaged 29.1 points in 1988–89, good for second in the NBA behind Michael Jordan, and 10.7 rebounds, which was fifth in the league.[17] This scoring average was Malone's highest so far in his career. At the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, Malone finished with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists en route to his first NBA All-Star MVP. The Jazz finished 51–31, but were swept in three games in the first round by the Golden State Warriors. This season marked Malone's first with the All-NBA First Team honor.[11]\n\n\nDuring the 1989–90, Malone increased his scoring to 31 points and his rebounding to 11.1 a game and again was selected to the All-NBA First Team.[11] In the first game of the season, Malone recorded 40 points, 16 rebounds and 5 assists in a 122–113 win over the Denver Nuggets.[18] On December 5, 1989, Malone scored 21 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a 94–80 win over the home team, Cleveland Cavaliers.[19] Seventeen days later, Malone recorded 52 points and 17 rebounds in a 114-100 road win over the Charlotte Hornets.[20] On January 27, 1990, Malone scored a career-high 61 points in a 144–96 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[21] He made 21 of 26 field goals and 19 of 23 free throws.[22] It was the most points scored by a Jazz player since the team moved to Utah from New Orleans. Although Malone was voted to the NBA All-Star Game for the third consecutive season, because of an ankle injury he sat out the game.[23] He led the team in scoring in 24 of the last 26 games of the season; on March 29, 1990, against the Golden State Warriors, Malone scored 49 points, and on April 12 against the Lakers he scored 45. The Jazz, finishing the season 55–27, lost to the Phoenix Suns within five games in the first round of the playoffs, in which Malone averaged 25.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. For the second straight season, Malone finished second in the league in points per game behind Michael Jordan.[11]\n\n\nFrom January 19 to March 4, 1991, Malone led the Jazz in scoring for 19 straight games; after starting the 1990–91 season 7–8 the team went 21–9 in January and February 1991. Malone scored 16 points and took 11 rebounds in the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance for the West, and averaged 29.0 points and 11.8 rebounds each regular-season game. He was among four Jazz players with double-figure scoring averages, the others being the newly acquired Jeff Malone (no relation) as well as John Stockton and Thurl Bailey. In four games, the Jazz eliminated the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1991 playoffs but lost to the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round. Malone made the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive season.[11]\n\n\nAs he had done in 1989–90, Malone finished the 1991–92 season second in the league in scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.[11] It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the 1992 NBA Playoffs, the team made the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.[24] Malone scored 40 or more points in five games this season.[11] Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a flagrant foul. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the Detroit Pistons, Malone elbowed the Pistons' Isiah Thomas on the forehead. Thomas needed 40 stitches over his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000.[25] In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz lost in the playoffs for the second straight season to the Portland Trail Blazers. Malone averaged 29.1 points on 52.1% shooting and 11.9 rebounds in the 1992 playoffs.[11]\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Malone put up stellar numbers: in 1992–93, he averaged 27.0 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds in 1993–94, 26.7 points and 10.6 rebounds in 1994–95, and 25.7 points and 9.8 rebounds in 1995–96.[26] Following the 1992 Summer Olympics in which Malone helped the American national team, dubbed the \"Dream Team\", win a gold medal, Malone expressed opposition to Magic Johnson, who had recently tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA in 1991, making a comeback to the league. Malone's point of view diverged from the support for Johnson from his Olympic and Los Angeles Lakers teammates, and the NBA implemented AIDS-related precautions after Johnson's revelation.[27] On February 4, 1993, in a game against the Lakers, Malone surpassed 16,000 career points. He and his teammate John Stockton shared the All-Star MVP award in 1993. In the West's 135–132 overtime win, Malone scored 28 points and pulled in 10 rebounds.[11]\n\n\nMalone started all 82 games of 1993–94 and helped the Jazz make the Western Conference Finals for the second time in franchise history and his career. In his ninth season, Malone led the Jazz in scoring (25.2), rebounding (11.5), and blocked shots (126), made 49.7% of field goal attempts, and played 3,329 minutes, the second-most that season in the league behind Latrell Sprewell's 3,533.[11] On March 29, 1994, Malone recorded a career-high 23 rebounds, but the Jazz lost to the Golden State Warriors 116–113. However, Malone made only 8 of 29 field goals that night and commented post-game: \"My rebounds are not going to be tomorrow's headline...Tomorrow's headline is going to be all those easy shots I missed.\"[28] The eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets eliminated the Jazz from the Western Conference Finals in five games.[11] Although Malone scored 32 points in the Jazz' 104–99 Game 2 loss, along with Stockton's 18, they and the Jazz were no match for the Rockets with high-scoring center Hakeem Olajuwon. Midway into the fourth quarter, Malone and Olajuwon scored on four consecutive possessions by their teams, leading up to a 93–93 tie.[29]\n\n\nFor the first time in team history, in 1994–95, the Utah Jazz won 60 games. In addition, the team won 15 consecutive away games (the best such streak by the team, then the second-best streak in the league). Malone's 26.7 points per game ranked fourth in the NBA, and Malone became the 19th NBA player to reach 20,000 career points on January 20, 1995. In the 1995 playoffs, the Jazz lost to the Houston Rockets for the second consecutive year, this time in the first round.[11] The Rockets became NBA champions for the second straight season.\n\n\nOn January 13, 1996, Malone renewed his contract with the Jazz.[26] The Jazz only made it as far as the Western Conference Finals in this period, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers (1992), the Houston Rockets (1994) and the Seattle SuperSonics (1996).\n\n\n\n#### Western Conference championship years (1996–1998)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone in 1997\nMalone returned from a gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. During the 1996–97 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64–18 record, the most regular-season wins in team history. Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference.[8][30] After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Clyde Drexler. The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls won the first two games at the United Center. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2. However, the Jazz won the next two games at the Delta Center behind Malone's 37 points in Game 3 and 23 in Game 4, including a game-winning fastbreak lay-up off a spectacular assist by Stockton in the last minute. The Bulls won the next two games and the series, with Malone struggling from the foul line in Game 6.\n\n\nThe next season saw the Jazz once again dominate. Malone put up 27 points per game and just missed out on his second MVP award, losing to Jordan. Nevertheless, the Jazz posted a 62–20 record, which was the best in the NBA. The Jazz once again were seated at the top of the Western Conference, and in the 1998 playoffs they defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Lakers via a sweep en route to their second consecutive Finals appearance. The rematch with the Chicago Bulls would start differently, as Malone put up 21 points and the Jazz won Game 1, 88–85. Malone found himself unable to put up consistently high numbers, due in large part to the swarming defense of defenders Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen. In Game 5 of the 1998 Finals, Malone led the Jazz in scoring with 39 points, and the Jazz beat the Bulls 83–81 in Chicago. Malone scored his 39 points on 17-for-27 shooting and also made 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 turnover. Many of his shots were \"mid-range turnaround jumpers from the left side\".[31]\n\n\nA sixth game of the Finals was held at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, and by trailing the series 3–2 the team was one loss away from losing the series.[32] Malone scored 31 points and made 11 rebounds. Although the Jazz held leads of 49–45 by halftime and 66–61 after the third quarter, the team squandered their lead in the fourth and would lose after Malone lost a pass in the post.[33] With 18.9 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Jazz leading 86–85, Bulls guard/forward Michael Jordan stole the ball just passed to Malone and with 5.2 seconds left made a jump shot that gave the Bulls an 87–86 lead. John Stockton missed a game-winning jump shot. Jordan's shot has been dubbed the \"greatest shot\" of his career, and the Bulls' 1998 title was their third consecutive championship and sixth since 1991.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Later seasons with Jazz (1998–2003)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 12, 1998, during the lockout that shortened the 1998–99 season, Malone declared on his Los Angeles-based radio show that he would demand a trade from the Jazz after the end of the lockout, citing a lack of respect from the team owner Larry H. Miller and the Utah media, which he dubbed \"goons\".[35] A week later, Malone backed off on his trade demands, stating in an interview that he would still love to play for the Jazz with \"everything else being equal\".[36] The NBA regular season resumed in February and Malone won his second MVP award, with the Jazz going 37–13 during the 50-game regular season. They lost in the second round that year to the Trail Blazers, and for the next several years the Jazz fell out of title contention. The Jazz won Game 5 of the second-round 1999 round against the Blazers 88–71 to force a sixth game, and Malone scored 23 points. In that game, Malone elbowed the Blazers' Brian Grant, something he also did in Game 1 and for which he was fined $10,000.[37] Despite the decline of his team and his advancing age, Malone averaged 25.5, 23.2, 22.4, and 20.6 points per game in his last four seasons with Utah. In the 2002–2003 season, Malone passed Wilt Chamberlain for second on the all-time scoring list with 36,374 points. He became a free agent in 2003, the year Stockton had retired. For the time Malone and Stockton played together on the Jazz (1985–2003), the two formed one of the most productive guard–forward combinations in NBA history.[*citation needed*] Playing coach Jerry Sloan's scrappy and tough style and perfecting the pick and roll to a maximum degree of efficiency, the Jazz regularly made the playoffs with a winning record. Malone led the Jazz to multiple 50-win seasons with the exception of 1992–93 (47–35).\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2003–2004)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone with the Lakers\nMalone played in the NBA for one more season, joining the Los Angeles Lakers in an attempt to win a championship. All-Star point guard Gary Payton also joined the Lakers in an attempt to win his first NBA championship, and with Malone, Payton, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were favorites to win the title. The Lakers rolled out to a dominant 18–3 start to the season, but on December 21, Malone suffered a knee injury against the Phoenix Suns that forced him to miss 39 games. Malone returned by the season's end, as the Lakers entered the playoffs with 56 wins and the number 2 seed in the playoffs. In the first round against the Houston Rockets, Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers' game 4 victory. The Lakers advanced to face the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against Tim Duncan, despite not scoring more than 13 points in any game during the series. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 6 games in the conference semifinals before defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in 6 games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals. He scored 17 points on two occasions against Minnesota and averaged 11.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game in the playoffs.\n\n\nThe 40-year-old Malone's quest to win an NBA championship failed as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Malone sprained his right knee in game three and played injured in games three and four before missing the fifth and final game of the series.\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nAfter his season with the Lakers, Malone became a free agent. He had knee surgery during the summer of 2004, and personal problems[38] with Lakers guard Kobe Bryant[39] prompted Malone not to return for another season with the team. The New York Knicks sought to sign Malone for 2004–05.[40] In early February 2005, prior to the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, Malone's agent speculated that Malone would sign with the San Antonio Spurs.[41] Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich confirmed his team was interested in signing Malone, should he decide to play one more season.[42]\n\n\nAt a press conference on February 13, 2005, at the Delta Center, Malone officially announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons.[43]\n\n\nThe Utah Jazz retired Malone's jersey number 32 on March 23, 2006, when the Jazz hosted the Washington Wizards. He was also honored with the unveiling of a bronze statue outside the EnergySolutions Arena next to teammate John Stockton, and the renaming of a portion of 100 South in Salt Lake City in his honor. The location where the statues stand is now the intersection of Stockton and Malone.[44]\n\n\n\n## Olympic career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, Malone and Stockton were both cut from the United States men's national basketball team but joined the team in 1992, when national basketball teams welcomed NBA players. Prior to that only professionals from leagues other than the NBA were allowed to compete, and that greatly disadvantaged the United States.[45]\n\n\nThe Oregon National Guard made Malone an honorary member after the U.S. national team beat the Venezuelan team 127–80 in the gold-medal game of the 1992 Olympic qualifier tournament.[46]\n\n\nMalone played in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics and won gold medals with the US team both years. In the 1996 Olympics, Malone averaged 8.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game and made 56.9% of two-point field goal attempts and 52.9% of free-throw attempts.[47] In 2010, he was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame along with the rest of the original Dream Team.[48]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### Louisiana Tech (2007–2011)[edit]\n\n\nOn May 31, 2007, Malone became director of basketball promotion and assistant strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater Louisiana Tech University and donated $350,000 to the university athletic department.[49]\n\n\nOn May 29, 2013, Malone returned to the Utah Jazz to work as a big man coach.[50]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone's statue outside the Vivint Arena\nMalone is regarded as one of the best power forwards in the history of the NBA and was known as \"the Mailman\" for his consistent delivery.[14] He collected two regular-season MVP Awards, eleven NBA First Team nominations and was also selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team three times. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Malone as the 16th greatest player in NBA history.[51]\n\n\nMalone led the NBA in free throws taken and made a league-record seven times.[*citation needed*] He was a physical defender and rebounder, and one of the most durable players ever in the NBA. He maintained a high level of play even at age 40, becoming the oldest player to both log a triple-double and to be a starter on an NBA Finals-bound team. Malone's work ethic showed prominently in his formative years in the NBA, when he raised his free throw shooting percentage from below 50% to 75%.\n\n\nMalone wore number 32 for the Utah Jazz. He wore number 11 for the Los Angeles Lakers (number 32 was retired honoring Magic Johnson, though Johnson himself offered to have it unretired for Malone to wear, an offer Malone declined), though he was photographed with a number 32 jersey at his Lakers introductory press conference. Malone also wore number 11 for the Dream Team, as the players wore 4 to 15 to adhere to FIBA rules.\n\n\nOver 1,476 NBA games (sixth all-time), and 1,471 starts (most all-time, never coming off the bench after his rookie season), Malone scored 36,928 points (25.0 per game), third-best all-time, on .516 shooting. His high field goal percentage benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton.[*citation needed*] Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all-time for two players on the same team, and missed just ten games out of a possible 1,444 games during his time with the Jazz (three because of suspension).\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  ‡ \n | NBA record\n |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985–86 | Utah | 81 | 76 | 30.6 | .496 | .000 | .481 | 8.9 | 2.9 | 1.3 | 0.5 | 14.9\n |\n| 1986–87 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 34.8 | .512 | .000 | .598 | 10.4 | 1.9 | 1.3 | 0.7 | 21.7\n |\n| 1987–88 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 39.0 | .520 | .000 | .700 | **12.0** | 2.4 | 1.4 | 0.6 | 27.7\n |\n| 1988–89 | Utah | 80 | 80 | 39.1 | .519 | .313 | .766 | 10.7 | 2.7 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 29.1\n |\n| 1989–90 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 38.1 | **.562** | .372 | .762 | 11.1 | 2.8 | 1.5 | 0.6 | **31.0** |\n| 1990–91 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 40.3 | .527 | .286 | .770 | 11.8 | 3.3 | 1.1 | 1.0 | 29.0\n |\n| 1991–92 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 37.7 | .526 | .176 | .778 | 11.2 | 3.0 | 1.3 | 0.6 | 28.0\n |\n| 1992–93 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 37.8 | .552 | .200 | .740 | 11.2 | 3.8 | 1.5 | 1.0 | 27.0\n |\n| 1993–94 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | **40.6** | .497 | .250 | .694 | 11.5 | 4.0 | 1.5 | **1.5** | 25.2\n |\n| 1994–95 | Utah | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 38.1 | .536 | .268 | .742 | 10.6 | 3.5 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 26.7\n |\n| 1995–96 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 38.0 | .519 | **.400** | .723 | 9.8 | 4.2 | 1.7 | 0.7 | 25.7\n |\n| 1996–97 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 36.6 | .550 | .000 | .755 | 9.9 | 4.5 | 1.4 | 0.6 | 27.4\n |\n| 1997–98 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .530 | .333 | .761 | 10.3 | 3.9 | 1.2 | 0.9 | 27.0\n |\n| 1998–99 | Utah | 49 | 49 | 37.4 | .493 | .000 | .788 | 9.4 | 4.1 | 1.3 | 0.6 | 23.8\n |\n| 1999–00 | Utah | **82** | **82**\\* | 35.9 | .509 | .250 | **.797** | 9.5 | 3.7 | 1.0 | 0.9 | 25.5\n |\n| 2000–01 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 35.7 | .498 | **.400** | .793 | 8.3 | 4.5 | 1.1 | 0.8 | 23.2\n |\n| 2001–02 | Utah | 80 | 80 | 38.0 | .454 | .360 | **.797** | 8.6 | 4.3 | **1.9** | 0.7 | 22.4\n |\n| 2002–03 | Utah | 81 | 81 | 36.2 | .462 | .214 | .763 | 7.8 | **4.7** | 1.7 | 0.4 | 20.6\n |\n| 2003–04 | L.A.

Karl Malone Toyota is in the Salt Lake City suburb of Draper, Utah, while Karl Malone Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram is in Heber City, Utah. Malone previously co-owned a Toyota dealership in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with Larry H. Miller Dealerships, but sold his share in 2010. He also co-owned a Honda dealership in Sandy, Utah, with John Stockton, but sold his share, again to Larry H. Miller Dealerships, in 2010. In 2019, he bought a Toyota dealership in Ruston, Louisiana, now called Karl Malone Toyota of Ruston.\n\n\nMalone also owns three Jiffy Lube franchises in Utah, and is a part owner of Burger King franchises in Utah and Idaho.[52]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nMalone starred in the 1994 film *Rockwell* as a member of Porter Rockwell's team.[54] He had a guest appearance as himself and as a superhero named \"Pulverizer\" in the *Static Shock* episode \"Hoop Squad\".[55] Malone also made a cameo appearance as himself in the 2004 comedy film *Soul Plane* and appears in an episode of *Brother's Keeper* from 1998.[56] He also has a recurring role in a skit called \"All Alone with Karl Malone\" on the television series *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*.[57]\n\n\n\n### Professional wrestling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone with Diamond Dallas Page in 1998\nAfter the 1998 NBA Finals, Malone and Chicago Bulls power forward Dennis Rodman participated in a professional wrestling match in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at their Bash at the Beach event in July 1998. Malone, a wrestling fan, teamed with his friend, Diamond Dallas Page, against Rodman and Hulk Hogan.[58][59] In a poorly received match by some wrestling critics, the two power forwards exchanged \"rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines\" for 23 minutes.[60] Malone and DDP lost to Rodman and Hogan. The event was a massive financial success for the company, drawing the highest pay-per-view buyrate of 1998 and one of the highest in the company's history.[61]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nChildren of Karl Malone\n* By Bonita Ford\n\t+ Cheryl (born 1981)\n\t+ Daryl (born 1981)\n* By Gloria Bell\n\t+ Demetress (born 1984)\n* By Kay Kinsey\n\t+ Kadee (born 1991)\n\t+ Kylee (born 1993)\n\t+ Karl, Jr. (born 1995)\n\t+ Karlee (born 1998)\n\nMalone married Kay Kinsey, winner of the 1988 Miss Idaho USA pageant, on December 24, 1990.[62] They have four children: daughter Kadee (born November 8, 1991),[63] daughter Kylee (born April 7, 1993), son Karl Jr. \"K.J.\" (born May 8, 1995), and daughter Karlee (born 1998).[62] K.J. played football at LSU,[64] and was invited to the 2018 NFL Combine.[65]\n\n\nIn 1998, the tabloid newspaper *The Globe* reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s. The newspaper alleged that he was the father of three children: two by Bonita Ford, a woman approximately his age from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana, and one with Gloria Bell, who was 13 when she gave birth. Malone and Ford were both 17 when twins Daryl and Cheryl Ford were born;[66] Malone was a 20-year-old college sophomore when Bell, at age 13, gave birth to Demetress Bell.[67] In the aftermath of the *Globe* story, Malone met the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born.[68] Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and his attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits before any conclusive establishment of paternity and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.\n\n\nThe *Tribune* confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. The paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One item listed was a laboratory blood test that concluded with over 99% certainty that Bell's father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying the same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone.[69][70] According to the *Tribune*, Malone challenged the court's ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone's appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case of the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.[69]\n\n\nBy the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone said publicly that the twins were members of the Malone family.[71] Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater, Louisiana Tech. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the Detroit Shock of the Women's National Basketball Association.\n\n\nBell has played as an NFL offensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles, and Dallas Cowboys. In 2008, *The Buffalo News* reported that Bell's first ever meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him then that it was \"too late\" for them to have a father-son relationship.[72] However, in 2014, the two repaired their relationship and were in regular contact by 2018.[73]\n\n\nIn 2018, Malone said about his relationship with his older children, \"I didn't handle it right; I was wrong. ... Father Time is the biggest thief that's out there, and you can't get that back.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMalone donated $4,000 to the 2004 reelection campaign of President George W. Bush and $2,000 to the 2004 U.S. Senate campaign of Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. In 2002, Malone donated $1,000 to the campaign of incumbent U.S. Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat representing Utah's 2nd congressional district.[74] Malone appeared on the \"Great American Panel\" segment of the Fox News talk show *Hannity* in March 2009. He advocated support for farmers in Louisiana who were about to lose their jobs due to the closing of Pilgrim's Pride plants.[75]\n\n\nMalone has served on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), a national firearms advocacy organization in the USA.[76]\n\n\n\n### Outdoor life[edit]\n\n\nMalone is an avid hunter and fisherman.[73] He owns a summer home near the Kenai River in Alaska.[77] In July 1998, Malone joined his Jazz teammates Chris Morris and Bryon Russell, some family members, corporate leadership of Q-Lube, and winners of a Q-Lube contest for a four-day fishing trip to Alaska.[78]\n\n\n\n### Public image[edit]\n\n\nMalone is known for frequently referring to himself in the third person.[79]\n\n\nHe has also appeared in television commercials for LA Gear sneakers,[80] Starter,[81] Morris Air Service,[82] Upper Deck,[83] and Burger King.[84]\n\n\nA cereal dedicated to him, MVP Flakes, was produced in 2000.[85]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association career games played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff steals leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game\n* List of National Basketball Association players with 50 or more points in a playoff game\n* List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\n* List of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Karl Malone Stats\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12]\n\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, *Shaq Diesel*, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, *Shaq's Big Challenge* and *Shaq Vs.* He hosts *The Big Podcast with Shaq*.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89\nO'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, *Shaq Fu: The Return*, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\"[19]\n\n\nO'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21]\n\n\nAfter returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a *33* jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1992–1996)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, *Sports Illustrated* writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\"[31]\n\n\n\n#### First playoff appearance (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][*unreliable source*] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n#### First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)[edit]\n\n\nIn O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37]\n\n\nO'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)[edit]\n\n\n#### O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nO'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the *Orlando Sentinel* published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \"no\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \"just didn't respect [Hill]\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44]\n\n\nOn the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The *Los Angeles Daily News* reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"[51]\n\n\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52]\n\n\nWith the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\nO'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57]\n\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\", O'Neal said. \"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58]\n\n\nA month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59]\n\n\nIn January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59]\n\n\nMatched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\" O'Neal meant \"cheat\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \"she\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\"[63] \nAfter the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59]\n\n\nUsing Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.\n\n\nFor the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \"Pay me.\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70]\n\n\nThe Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74]\n\n\nDespite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79]\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80]\n\n![](image)O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \"Benedict Arnold\". Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n\nO'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)[edit]\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\"[93]\n\n\nIn 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94]\n\n\nO'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\", O'Neal said. \"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash\nOn February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.\n\n\nIn a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \"It's not really my role anymore.\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\"[100] O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\"[102] In a 2006 interview in *TIME*, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\"[103]\n\n\nOn March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\"[104]\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics.\nUpon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119]\n\n\nO'Neal said he did not \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nWhile in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\nHe was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136]\n\n\nAfter his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \"lack of respect\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.\nO'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.\n\n\nAt 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144]\n\n\nO'Neal's \"drop step\", (called the \"Black Tornado\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65]\n\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\nThe Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Media personality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 1998\nO'Neal called himself \"The Big Aristotle\" and \"Hobo Master\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\nO'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \"Queens\".[164][165][166] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[167] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal.\n\n\nHe also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\"[168] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[169] Yao joked, \"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\"[170] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[171]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[172] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[173]\n\n\nO'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \"I'm sorry, who?\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[174]\n\n\nO'Neal also appeared on television on *Saturday Night Live* (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted *Shaq's Big Challenge*, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.\n\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \"Bryant–O'Neal feud\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[175] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\".[176] O'Neal justified his act by saying \"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\"[177] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[178] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\". The racial quote from his song was \"it's like a white boy trying to be more nigga than me.\"[179]\n\n\n\n### Music career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Shaquille O'Neal + DIESEL (DJ)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game](image)DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game\n |\n| Background information |\n| Genres | Hip hop, electronic dance music |\n| Occupation(s) | Rapper, DJ |\n| Years active | 1993–2001; 2017–present |\n| Labels | Jive, Interscope, A&M, Trauma, Monstercat |\n\n\nBeginning in 1993, O'Neal began to compose rap music.

The three-minute song was released in response to Ball claiming him and his younger son LaMelo, would beat O'Neal and his son Shareef in a game of basketball.\n\n\nOn October 23, 2021, O'Neal performed as DJ Diesel on the bassPOD stage at the 2021 Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Nevada.[187][188][189]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2023, O'Neal released his first single as DJ Diesel from his debut album *Gorilla Warfare*, titled \"Bang Your Head\" in collaboration with Hairitage.[190] The album was released on August 18.[191]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal left LSU for the NBA after three years. However, he promised his mother he would eventually return to his studies and complete his bachelor's degree. He fulfilled that promise in 2000, earning his B.A. degree in general studies from LSU,[192] with a minor in political science.[193] Coach Phil Jackson let O'Neal miss a home game so he could attend graduation. At the ceremony, he told the crowd \"now I can go and get a real job\".\nSubsequently, O'Neal earned an online MBA degree through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In reference to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: \"It's just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else.\"[194]\n\n\nToward the end of his playing career, he began work on an educational doctorate at Barry University.[195][196] His doctoral capstone[197][198] topic was \"The Duality of Humor and Aggression in Leadership Styles\".[195][199] O'Neal received his Ed.D. degree in Human Resource Development from Barry in 2012.[200] O'Neal told a reporter for ABC News that he plans to further his education by attending law school.[201]\n\n\nIn 2009, O'Neal attended the Sportscaster U. training camp at S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, saying \"You have to know what you're doing... I needed to learn the secrets\".[202][203]\n\n\nO'Neal has also studied directing and cinematography with the New York Film Academy's Filmmaking Conservatory.[204]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal maintained a high level of interest in the workings of police departments and became personally involved in law enforcement. O'Neal went through the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Reserve Academy and became a reserve officer with the Los Angeles Port Police. \nOn March 2, 2005, O'Neal was given an honorary U.S. Deputy Marshal title and named the spokesman for the Safe Surfin' Foundation; he served an honorary role on the task force of the same name, which tracks down sexual predators who target children on the Internet.[205]\n\n\nUpon his trade to Miami, O'Neal began training to become a Miami Beach reserve officer. On December 8, 2005, he was sworn in, but elected for a private ceremony to avoid distracting attention from the other officers. He assumed a $1-per-year salary in this capacity.[206] Shortly thereafter, in Miami, O'Neal witnessed a hate crime (assaulting a man while calling out homophobic slurs) and called Miami-Dade police, describing the suspect and helping police, over his cell phone, track the offender.[206] O'Neal's actions resulted in the arrest of two suspects on charges of aggravated battery, assault, and a hate crime.[207]\n\n\nIn September 2006, O'Neal took part in a raid on a home in rural Bedford County, Virginia. O'Neal had been made an \"honorary deputy\" by the local sheriff's department. O'Neal was not qualified as a SWAT officer.[208]\n\n\nIn June 2008, the Bedford County, Virginia, and Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff departments revoked O'Neal's special deputyship after a video surfaced of him rapping about Kobe Bryant and using racial slurs.[209][210]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2015, O'Neal was sworn in as a reserve officer for Doral, Florida's police force.[211] In December 2016, O'Neal was sworn in as a sheriff's deputy in Jonesboro, Georgia, as part of Clayton County, Georgia Sheriff's Department.

He is a 7-foot-1-inch (2.16 m) and 325-pound (147 kg) center who played for six teams over his 19-year career in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is a four-time NBA champion. O'Neal is regarded as one of the greatest basketball players and centers of all time.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the LSU Tigers, O'Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. He quickly became one of the best centers in the league, winning Rookie of the Year in 1992–93 and leading his team to the 1995 NBA Finals. After four years with the Magic, O'Neal signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers. They won three consecutive championships in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Amid a feud between O'Neal and his teammate Kobe Bryant, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004, and his fourth NBA championship followed in 2006. Midway through the 2007–2008 season he was traded to the Phoenix Suns. After a season-and-a-half with the Suns, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2009–10 season.[6] O'Neal played for the Boston Celtics in the 2010–11 season before retiring.[7]\n\n\nO'Neal's individual accolades include the 1999–2000 Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award; the 1992–93 NBA Rookie of the Year award; 15 All-Star Game selections, three All-Star Game MVP awards; three Finals MVP awards; two scoring titles; 14 All-NBA team selections, and three NBA All-Defensive Team selections. He is one of only three players to win NBA MVP, All-Star Game MVP and Finals MVP awards in the same year (2000); the other players are Willis Reed in 1970 and Michael Jordan in 1996 and 1998. He ranks 8th all-time in points scored, 6th in field goals, 15th in rebounds, and 8th in blocks. O'Neal was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team in 1996.[8] Due to his ability to dunk the basketball and score from close range, O'Neal also ranks third all-time in field goal percentage (58.2%) and led the league in field goal percentage ten times.[9] O'Neal was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.[10] He was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.[11] In October 2021, O'Neal was again honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[12]\n\n\nIn addition to his basketball career, O'Neal has released four rap albums, with his first, *Shaq Diesel*, going platinum. O'Neal is also an electronic music producer, and touring DJ, known as DIESEL.[13] He has appeared in numerous films and has starred in his own reality shows, *Shaq's Big Challenge* and *Shaq Vs.* He hosts *The Big Podcast with Shaq*.[14] He was a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings from 2013 to 2022 and is the general manager of Kings Guard Gaming of the NBA 2K League.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal playing for the Cole High School varsity basketball team in 1988–89\nO'Neal was born on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey,[16] to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school basketball (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's Jamaican stepfather, Phillip Arthur Harrison, a career Army sergeant.[17][18] O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or expressed an interest in establishing a relationship.[18] On his 1994 rap album, *Shaq Fu: The Return*, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\" However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two met for the first time in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, \"I don't hate you. I had a good life. I had Phil.\"[19]\n\n\nO'Neal came from a tall family. His father and mother were 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m) and 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall, respectively, and by age 13, O'Neal was already 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall. He credited the Boys & Girls Clubs of America in Newark with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\"[20] Because of his stepfather's career in the military, the family left Newark, moving to military bases in Germany and Texas.[21]\n\n\nAfter returning from Germany, O'Neal's family settled in San Antonio, Texas. By age 16, O'Neal had grown to 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), and he began playing basketball at Robert G. Cole High School. He led his team to a 68–1 record over two years and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[22] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.[23] O'Neal's tendency to make hook shots earned comparisons to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, inspiring him to wear the same jersey number as Abdul-Jabbar, No. 33. However, his high school team did not have a *33* jersey, so O'Neal chose to wear No. 32 before college.[24]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, O'Neal studied business at Louisiana State University (LSU). He had first met Tigers coach Dale Brown years earlier in Europe when O'Neal's stepfather was stationed on a U.S. Army base at Wildflecken, West Germany. While playing for Brown at LSU, O'Neal was a two-time All-American, two-time SEC Player of the Year, and received the Adolph Rupp Trophy as NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991; he was also named college player of the year by AP and UPI. O'Neal left LSU early to pursue his NBA career, but continued his education even after becoming a professional player.[25] He was later inducted into the LSU Hall of Fame.[26] A 900-pound (410 kg) bronze statue of O'Neal is located in front of the LSU Basketball Practice Facility.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (1992–1996)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted O'Neal with the 1st overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft. In the summer before moving to Orlando, he spent time in Los Angeles under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.[28] O'Neal wore number 32 because Terry Catledge refused to relinquish the 33 jersey.[24] O'Neal was named the Player of the Week in his first week in the NBA, the first player to do so.[29] During his rookie season, O'Neal averaged 23.4 points on 56.2% shooting, 13.9 rebounds, and 3.5 blocks per game for the season. He was named the 1993 NBA Rookie of the Year and was the first rookie to be voted an All-Star starter since Michael Jordan in 1985.[30] The Magic finished 41–41, winning 20 more games than the previous season, but missed the playoffs by virtue of a tie-breaker with the Indiana Pacers. On more than one occasion during the year, *Sports Illustrated* writer Jack McCallum overheard O'Neal saying, \"We've got to get [head coach] Matty [Guokas] out of here and bring in [assistant] Brian [Hill].\"[31]\n\n\n\n#### First playoff appearance (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1993–1994, O'Neal's second season, Hill was the coach and Guokas was reassigned to the front office.[32] O'Neal improved his scoring average to 29.4 points (second in the league to David Robinson) while leading the NBA in field goal percentage at 60%. On November 20, 1993, against the New Jersey Nets, O'Neal registered the first triple-double of his career, recording 24 points to go along with career highs of 28 rebounds and 15 blocks.[33] He was voted into the All-Star game and also made the All-NBA 3rd Team. Teamed with newly drafted Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway, the Magic finished with a record of 50–32 and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history.[34] In his first playoff series, O'Neal averaged 20.7 points and 13.3 rebounds[35][*unreliable source*] as the Pacers swept the Magic.[36][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n#### First scoring title and NBA Finals (1994–1996)[edit]\n\n\nIn O'Neal's third season, 1994–95, he led the NBA in scoring with a 29.3 point average, while finishing second in MVP voting to David Robinson and entering his third straight All-Star Game along with Hardaway. They formed one of the league's top duos and helped Orlando to a 57–25 record and the Atlantic Division crown. The Magic won their first-ever playoff series against the Boston Celtics in the 1995 NBA Playoffs. They then defeated the Chicago Bulls in the conference semifinals. After beating Reggie Miller's Indiana Pacers, the Magic reached the NBA Finals, facing the defending NBA champion Houston Rockets. O'Neal played well in his first Finals appearance, averaging 28 points on 59.5% shooting, 12.5 rebounds, and 6.3 assists. Despite this, the Rockets, led by future Hall-of-Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler, swept the series in four games.[37]\n\n\nO'Neal was injured for a great deal of the 1995–96 season, missing 28 games. He averaged 26.6 points and 11 rebounds per game, made the All-NBA 3rd Team, and played in his 4th All-Star Game. Despite O'Neal's injuries, the Magic finished with a regular season record of 60–22, second in the Eastern conference to the Chicago Bulls, who finished with an NBA record 72 wins. Orlando easily defeated the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds of the 1996 NBA Playoffs; however, they were no match for Jordan's Bulls, who swept them in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004)[edit]\n\n\n#### O'Neal–Bryant tandem buildup (1996–1999)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 8 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers (1996–2004), O'Neal won three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 and appeared in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nO'Neal became a free agent after the 1995–96 NBA season. In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic basketball team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the *Orlando Sentinel* published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning.[38][39] 82% answered \"no\".[38] O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill.[40][41] He said the team \"just didn't respect [Hill]\".[42] Another question in the poll asked whether O'Neal was worth $115 million, in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer; 91.3% of the response said it was not.[39][40] O'Neal's Olympic teammates teased him over the poll.[39][41] He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry.[38] O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to \"feeling like a big fish in a dried-up pond\".[43] He also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him.[44]\n\n\nOn the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, the media announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121 million contract.[45][46] O'Neal insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money; discussing the signing he referred to a couple of his product endorsements, saying: \"I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.\"[47][48] The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season.[49] O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games.[50] In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The *Los Angeles Daily News* reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: \"It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough.\"[51]\n\n\nThe following season, O'Neal averaged 28.3 points and 11.4 rebounds. He led the league with a 58.4 field goal percentage, the first of five consecutive seasons in which he did so. The Lakers finished the season 61–21, first in the Pacific Division, and were the second seed in the western conference during the 1998 NBA Playoffs. After defeating the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle SuperSonics in the first two rounds, the Lakers again fell to the Jazz, this time in a 4–0 sweep.[52]\n\n\nWith the tandem of O'Neal and teenage superstar Kobe Bryant, expectations for the Lakers increased; however, personnel changes were a source of instability during the 1998–99 season. Long-time Laker point guard Nick Van Exel was traded to the Denver Nuggets; his former backcourt partner Eddie Jones was packaged with back-up center Elden Campbell for Glen Rice to satisfy a demand by O'Neal for a shooter. Coach Del Harris was fired, and former Lakers forward Kurt Rambis finished the season as head coach. The Lakers finished with a 31–19 record during the lockout-shortened season. Although they made the playoffs, they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs, led by Tim Duncan and David Robinson in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs. The Spurs would go on to win their first NBA title in 1999.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship seasons (1999–2002)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999–2000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123–103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\nO'Neal was also voted the 1999–2000 regular season Most Valuable Player, one vote short of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. Fred Hickman, then of CNN, instead chose Allen Iverson, then of the Philadelphia 76ers who would go on to win MVP the next season. O'Neal also won the scoring title while finishing second in rebounds and third in blocked shots. Jackson's influence resulted in a newfound commitment by O'Neal to defense, resulting in his first All-Defensive Team selection (second-team) in 2000.[57]\n\n\nIn the 2001 NBA Finals against the 76ers, O'Neal fouled out in Game 3 backing over Dikembe Mutombo, the 2000–2001 Defensive Player of the Year. \"I didn't think the best defensive player in the game would be flopping like that. It's a shame that the referees buy into that\", O'Neal said. \"I wish he'd stand up and play me like a man instead of flopping and crying every time I back him down.[58]\n\n\nA month before the 2001–02 season's training camp, O'Neal had corrective surgery for a claw toe deformity in the smallest toe of his left foot.[59] He opted against a more involved surgery to return quicker.[60] He was ready for the start of the 2001–02 regular season, but the toe frequently bothered him.[59]\n\n\nIn January 2002, he was involved in a spectacular on-court brawl in a game against the Chicago Bulls. He punched center Brad Miller after an intentional foul to prevent a basket, resulting in a melee with Miller, forward Charles Oakley, and several other players.[61] O'Neal was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000.[62] For the season, O'Neal averaged 27.2 points and 10.7 rebounds, excellent statistics but below his career average; he was less of a defensive force during the season.[59]\n\n\nMatched up against the Sacramento Kings in the 2002 Western Conference finals, O'Neal said, \"There is only one way to beat us. It starts with c and ends with t.\" O'Neal meant \"cheat\" in reference to the alleged flopping of Kings' center Vlade Divac. O'Neal referred to Divac as \"she\", and said he would never exaggerate contact to draw a foul. \"I'm a guy with no talent who has gotten this way with hard work.\"[63] \nAfter the 2001–2002 season, O'Neal told friends that he did not want another season of limping and being in virtually constant pain from his big right toe. His trademark mobility and explosion had been often absent. The corrective options ranged from reconstructive surgery on the toe to rehabilitation exercises with more shoe inserts and anti-inflammation medication. O'Neal was already wary of the long-term damage his frequent consumption of these medications might have. He did not want to rush a decision with his career potentially at risk.[59]\n\n\nUsing Jackson's triangle offense, O'Neal and Bryant enjoyed tremendous success, leading the Lakers to three consecutive titles (2000, 2001, and 2002). O'Neal was named MVP of the NBA Finals all three times and had the highest scoring average for a center in NBA Finals history.[64]\n\n\n\n#### Toe surgery to departure (2002–2004)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal missed the first 12 games of the 2002–03 season recovering from toe surgery.[65] He was sidelined with hallux rigidus, a degenerative arthritis in his toe.[66] He waited the whole summer until just before training camp for the surgery and explained, \"I got hurt on company time, so I'll heal on company time.\"[67] O'Neal debated whether to have a more invasive surgery that would have kept him out an additional three months, but he opted against the more involved procedure.[66] The Lakers started the season with a record of 11–19.[68] At the end of the season, the Lakers had fallen to the fifth seed and failed to reach the Finals in 2003.\n\n\nFor the 2003–04 season, the team made a concerted off-season effort to improve its roster. They sought the free-agent services of two aging stars—forward Karl Malone and guard Gary Payton—but due to salary cap restrictions, could not offer either player nearly as much money as he could have made with some other teams. O'Neal assisted in the recruitment efforts and personally persuaded both men to join the squad, each forgoing larger salaries in favor of a chance to win an NBA championship. At the beginning of the 2003–04 season, O'Neal wanted a contract extension with a pay raise on his remaining three years for $30 million. The Lakers had hoped O'Neal would take less money due to his age, physical conditioning, and games missed due to injuries. During a preseason game, O'Neal had yelled at Lakers owner Jerry Buss, \"Pay me.\"[69] There had been increasing tension between O'Neal and Bryant. The feud climaxed during training camp prior to the 2003–2004 season when Bryant, in an interview with ESPN journalist Jim Gray, criticized O'Neal for being out of shape, a poor leader, and putting his salary demands over the best interest of the team.[70]\n\n\nThe Lakers made the playoffs in 2004 and lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter said, \"Shaq defeated himself against Detroit. He played way too passively. He had one big game ... He's always interested in being a scorer, but he hasn't had nearly enough concentration on defense and rebounding\".[71] After the series, O'Neal was angered by comments made by Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak regarding O'Neal's future with the club, as well as by the departure of Lakers coach Phil Jackson at the request of Buss. O'Neal made comments indicating that he felt the team's decisions were centered on a desire to appease Bryant to the exclusion of all other concerns, and O'Neal promptly demanded a trade. Kupchak wanted the Dallas Mavericks' Dirk Nowitzki in return but Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to let his 7-footer go. However, Miami showed interest, and eventually the two clubs agreed on a trade.[72] Winter said, \"[O'Neal] left because he couldn't get what he wanted—a huge pay raise. There was no way ownership could give him what he wanted. Shaq's demands held the franchise hostage, and the way he went about it didn't please the owner too much.\"[73]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2004–2008)[edit]\n\n\n#### MVP runner-up (2004–2005)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Miami in 2007\nOn July 14, 2004, O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Caron Butler, Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, and a future first-round draft choice (the Lakers used the draft choice to select Jordan Farmar in the 2006 draft). O'Neal reverted from (his Lakers jersey) number 34 to number 32, which he had worn while playing for the Magic. Upon signing with the Heat, O'Neal promised the fans that he would bring a championship to Miami. He claimed one of the main reasons for wanting to be traded to Miami was because of their up-and-coming star Dwyane Wade, to whom he gave the nickname \"Flash\". With O'Neal on board, the new-look Heat surpassed expectations, claiming the best record in the Eastern Conference in 2004–05 with 59 wins. He played in 73 games, his most since 2001 season, averaged 22.9 points a game along with 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks. O'Neal made his 12th consecutive All-Star Team, made the All-NBA 1st Team, and won the Eastern Conference Player of the Month award for his performance in March. O'Neal also narrowly lost the 2004–05 MVP Award to Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash in one of the closest votes in NBA history.[74]\n\n\nDespite being hobbled by a deep thigh bruise, O'Neal led the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals and a Game 7 against the defending champion Detroit Pistons, losing by a narrow margin. Afterwards, O'Neal and others criticized Heat head coach Stan Van Gundy for not calling enough plays for O'Neal.[75] \nIn August 2005, O'Neal signed a 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100 million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's willingness to take what amounted to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20 million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth championship (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn the second game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and subsequently missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities.[67] O'Neal later referred to Van Gundy as a \"frontrunner\" and a \"master of panic.\"[77] Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal during the rest of the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview \"Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I knew I did something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game.\"[78] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a .500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.[79]\n\n\n\nOn April 11, 2006, O'Neal recorded his second career triple-double against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points, 11 rebounds and a career-high 10 assists.[80] O'Neal finished the 2005–06 season as the league leader in field goal percentage.[80]\n\n![](image)O'Neal holding the championship ball when the NBA Champion Heat visited the White House\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2–0 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3–1 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, O'Neal missed 35 games after an injury to his left knee in November required surgery.[82][83] After one of those missed games, a Christmas Day match-up against the Lakers, he ripped Jackson, who O'Neal had once called a second father, referring to his former coach as \"Benedict Arnold\". Jackson had previously said, \"The only person I've ever [coached] that hasn't been a worker... is probably Shaq.\"[84] The Heat struggled during O'Neal's absence,[85] but with his return won seven of their next eight games. Bad luck still haunted the squad, however, as Wade dislocated his left shoulder, leaving O'Neal as the focus of the team.[85] Critics doubted that O'Neal, now in his mid-30s, could carry the team into the playoffs.[86] The Heat went on a winning streak that kept them in the race for a playoff spot, which they finally secured against the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 5.[85]\n\n\nIn a rematch of the year before, the Heat faced the Bulls in the first round of the 2006–07 NBA playoffs. The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50 years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006–07 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20 points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal experienced a rough start for the 2007–08 season, averaging career lows in points, rebounds, and blocks. His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15–game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n\nO'Neal played 33 games for the Miami Heat in the 2007–08 season prior to being traded to the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal started all 33 games and averaged 14.2 points per game. Following the trade to Phoenix, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points while starting all 28 games with the Suns.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns (2008–2009)[edit]\n\n\nThe Phoenix Suns acquired O'Neal in February 2008 from the league-worst Miami Heat, who had a record at the time of the trade of 9–37, in exchange for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.[92] O'Neal made his Suns debut on February 20, 2008, against his former Lakers team, scoring 15 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in the process. The Lakers won, 130–124. O'Neal was upbeat in a post-game press conference, stating: \"I will take the blame for this loss because I wasn't in tune with the guys [...] But give me four or five days to really get in tune and I'll get it.\"[93]\n\n\nIn 28 regular season games, O'Neal averaged 12.9 points and 10.6 rebounds,[94] good enough to make the playoffs. One of the reasons for the trade was to limit Tim Duncan in the event of a postseason matchup between the Suns and the San Antonio Spurs, especially after the Suns' six-game elimination by the Spurs in the 2007 NBA Playoffs.[95] O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns did face the Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, but they were once again eliminated, in five games. O'Neal averaged 15.2 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.[94]\n\n\nO'Neal preferred his new situation with the Suns over the Heat. \"I love playing for this coach and I love playing with these guys\", O'Neal said. \"We have professionals who know what to do. No one is asking me to play with [his former Heat teammates] Chris Quinn or Ricky Davis. I'm actually on a team again.\" Riley felt O'Neal was wrong for maligning his former teammates. O'Neal responded with an expletive toward Riley, whom he often referred to as the \"great Pat Riley\" while playing for the Heat.[96] O'Neal credited the Suns training staff with prolonging his career.[97] They connected his arthritic toe, which would not bend, to the alteration of his jump that consequently was straining his leg. The trainers had him concentrate on building his core strength, flexibility, and balance.[98]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 season improved for O'Neal, who averaged 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 1.6 blocks through the first half (41 games) of the season, leading the Suns to a 23–18 record and 2nd place in their division.[99] He returned to the All-Star Game in 2009 and emerged as co-MVP along with ex-teammate Kobe Bryant.\n\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal with Phoenix teammate Steve Nash\nOn February 27, 2009, O'Neal scored 45 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, his 49th career 40-point game, beating the Toronto Raptors 133–113.\n\n\nIn a matchup against Orlando on March 3, 2009, O'Neal was outscored by Magic center Dwight Howard, 21–19. \"I'm really too old to be trying to outscore 18-year-olds\", O'Neal said, referring to the then 23-year-old Howard. \"It's not really my role anymore.\" O'Neal was double-teamed most of the night. \"I like to play people one-on-one. My whole career I had to play people one-on-one. Never once had to double or ask for a double. But it's cool\", said O'Neal. During the game, O'Neal flopped against Howard. Magic coach Stan Van Gundy, who had coached O'Neal with the Heat, was \"very disappointed cause [O'Neal] knows what it's like. Let's stand up and play like men, and I think our guy did that tonight.\"[100] O'Neal responded, \"Flopping is playing like that your whole career. I was trying to take the charge, trying to get a call. It probably was a flop, but flopping is the wrong use of words. Flopping would describe his coaching.\"[101] Mark Madsen, a Lakers teammate of O'Neal's for three years, found it amusing since \"everyone in the league tries to flop on Shaq and Shaq never flops back.\"[102] In a 2006 interview in *TIME*, O'Neal said if he were NBA commissioner, he would \"Make a guy have to beat a guy—not flop and get calls and be nice to the referees and kiss ass.\"[103]\n\n\nOn March 6, O'Neal talked about the upcoming game against the Rockets and Yao Ming. \"It's not going to be man-on-man, so don't even try that,\" says O'Neal with an incredulous laugh. \"They're going to double and triple me like everybody else ... I rarely get to play [Yao] one-on-one ... But when I play him (on defense), it's just going to be me down there. So don't try to make it a Yao versus Shaq thing, when it's Shaq versus four other guys.\"[104]\n\n\nThe 2009 NBA Playoffs was also the first time since O'Neal's rookie season in 1992–93 that he did not participate in the playoffs. He was named as a member of the All-NBA Third Team. The Suns notified O'Neal he might be traded to cut costs.[105]\n\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2009–2010)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2009, O'Neal was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Sasha Pavlovic, Ben Wallace, $500,000, and a 2010 second-round draft pick.[106] Upon arriving in Cleveland, O'Neal said, \"My motto is very simple: Win a Ring for the King\", referring to LeBron James.[107] James was the leader of the team, and O'Neal deferred to him.[108] On February 25, 2010, O'Neal suffered a severe right thumb injury while attempting to go up for a shot against Glen Davis of the Boston Celtics.[109] He had surgery on the thumb on March 1 and returned to play in time for the first round of the playoffs.[110] After defeating the Chicago Bulls in the first round, the Cavaliers went on to lose to the Boston Celtics in the second round. In September 2016, O'Neal said: \"When I was in Cleveland, we were in first place. Big Baby [Glen Davis] breaks my hand and I had to sit out five weeks late in the year. I come back finally in the first round of the playoffs, and we lost to Boston in the second round. I was upset. I know for a fact if I was healthy, we would have gotten it done that year and won a ring.\"[111] O'Neal averaged career lows in almost every major statistical category during the 2009–10 season, taking on a much less significant role than in previous years.\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2010–2011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal finished his career with the Boston Celtics.\nUpon hearing Bryant comment that he had more rings than O'Neal, Wyc Grousbeck, principal owner of the Celtics, saw an opportunity to acquire O'Neal.[112] Celtics coach Doc Rivers agreed to the signing on the condition that O'Neal would not receive preferential treatment, nor could he cause any locker room problems like in Los Angeles or Miami.[113] On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal.[114] The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8 million.[115] O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal.[116] The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands.[117][118] He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.[119]\n\n\nO'Neal said he did not \"compete with little guys who run around dominating the ball, throwing up 30 shots a night—like D–Wade, Kobe.\" O'Neal added that he was only competing against Duncan: \"If Tim Duncan gets five rings, then that gives some writer the chance to say 'Duncan is the best,' and I can't have that.\"[120] Publicly, he insisted he did not care whether he started or substituted for the Celtics, but expected to be part of the second unit.[120] Privately, he wanted to start, but kept it to himself.[121] O'Neal missed games throughout the season due to an assortment of ailments to his right leg[122] including knee,[123] calf,[124] hip,[125] and Achilles injuries.[126] The Celtics traded away center Kendrick Perkins in February partially due to the expectation that O'Neal would return to fill Perkins' role. The Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury,[122] and they were 19–3 in games that O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[127] After requesting a cortisone shot, O'Neal returned April 3 after missing 27 games due to his Achilles; he played only five minutes due to a strained right calf.[122][128] It was the last regular season game he would play that year.[129] O'Neal missed the first round of the 2011 playoffs. He insisted on more cortisone shots and returned in the second round, but he was limited to 12 minutes in two games as the Heat eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs.[130][131]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2011, O'Neal announced his retirement via social media.[132][133] On a short video on Twitter, O'Neal tweeted, \"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much. That's why I'm telling you first. I'm about to retire. Love you. Talk to you soon.\" On June 3, 2011, O'Neal held a press conference at his home in Orlando to officially announce his retirement.[134]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nWhile in college, O'Neal was considered for the Dream Team to fill the college spot, but it eventually went to future teammate Christian Laettner.[135] His national team career began in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in which he was named MVP of the Tournament. While he led the Dream Team II to the gold medal with an 8–0 record, O'Neal averaged 18 points and 8.5 rebounds and recorded two double-doubles. In four games, he scored more than 20 points. Before 2010, he was the last active American player to have a gold from the FIBA World Cup.\n\n\nHe was one of two players (the other being Reggie Miller) from the 1994 roster to be also named to the Dream Team III. Due to more star-power, he rotated with Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson and started 3 games. He averaged 9.3 points and 5.3 rebounds with 8 total blocks. Again, a perfect 8–0 record landed him another gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. O'Neal was upset that coach Lenny Wilkens played Robinson more minutes in the final game; Wilkens previously explained to O'Neal that it would probably be Robinson's last Olympics.[136]\n\n\nAfter his 1996 experience, he declined to play in international competition. He was angered by being overlooked for the 1999 FIBA AmeriCup squad, saying it was a \"lack of respect\".[137] He forwent an opportunity to participate in the 2000 Olympics, explaining that two gold medals were enough.[138] O'Neal also chose not to play in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.[139] He rejected an offer to play in the 2004 Olympics,[140] and although he was initially interested in being named for 2006–2008 US preliminary roster,[141] he eventually declined the invitation.[142]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal's free throw shooting was regarded as one of his major weaknesses.\nO'Neal established himself as an overpowering low post presence, putting up career averages of 23.7 points on .582 field goal accuracy, 10.9 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per game.\n\n\nAt 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m), 330 lb (150 kg)[143] and U.S. shoe size 23,[65] he became famous for his physical stature. His physical frame gave him a power advantage over most opponents. On two occasions during his first season in the NBA, his powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports, prompting the league to increase the brace strength and stability of the backboards for the following 1993–94 season.[144]\n\n\nO'Neal's \"drop step\", (called the \"Black Tornado\" by O'Neal) in which he posted up a defender, turned around and, using his elbows for leverage, powered past him for a very high-percentage slam dunk, proved an effective offensive weapon. In addition, O'Neal frequently used a right-handed jump hook shot to score near the basket. The ability to dunk contributed to his career field goal accuracy of .582, second only to Artis Gilmore as the highest field goal percentage of all time.[145] He led the NBA in field goal percentage 10 times, breaking Wilt Chamberlain's record of nine.[65]\n\n\nOpposing teams often used up many fouls on O'Neal, reducing the playing time of their own big men. O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80 percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010–11 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\nO'Neal only made one three-point shot during his entire career. He made the shot during the 1995–96 NBA season with the Orlando Magic. His career three-point-shot record is 1 for 22 (a 4.5% career percentage).\n\n\nO'Neal was a capable defender, named three times to the All-NBA Second Defensive Team. His presence intimidated opposing players shooting near the basket, and he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game over the course of his career.[151]\n\n\nPhil Jackson believed O'Neal underachieved in his career, saying he \"could and should have been the MVP player for 10 consecutive seasons.\"[152] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named O'Neal as the 8th greatest player in NBA history.[153]\n\n\nThe Lakers retired his No. 34 jersey on April 2, 2013.[154] On February 26, 2016, the Miami Heat announced that it would retire O'Neal's No. 32 jersey during the 2016–17 season, making O'Neal one of just 32 athletes in American professional sports history to have their jersey retired by multiple teams.[155][156] The Heat eventually retired his jersey on December 22, 2016, during halftime of a game against his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Media personality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 1998\nO'Neal called himself \"The Big Aristotle\" and \"Hobo Master\" for his composure and insights during interviews. Journalists and others gave O'Neal several nicknames, including \"Shaq\", \"The Diesel\", \"Shaq Fu\", \"The Big Daddy\", \"Superman\", \"The Big Agave\", \"The Big Cactus\", \"The Big Shaqtus\", \"The Big Galactus\", \"Wilt Chamberneezy\", \"The Big Baryshnikov\", \"The Real Deal\", \"The Big Shamrock\", \"The Big Leprechaun\", \"Shaqovic\",[157][158] and \"The Big Conductor\".[159] Although he was a favorite interviewee of the press, O'Neal was sensitive and often went weeks without speaking.[160] When he did not want to speak with the press, he employed an interview technique whereby, sitting in front of his cubicle, he would murmur in his low-pitched voice.[160][161]\n\n\nDuring the 2000 Screen Actors Guild strike, O'Neal performed in a commercial for Disney. O'Neal was fined by the union for crossing the picket line.[162][163]\n\n\nO'Neal's humorous and sometimes incendiary comments fueled the Los Angeles Lakers' long-standing rivalry with the Sacramento Kings; O'Neal frequently referred to the Sacramento team as the \"Queens\".[164][165][166] During the 2002 victory parade, O'Neal declared that Sacramento would never be the capital of California,[167] after the Lakers beat the Kings in a tough seven-game series en route to its third championship with O'Neal.\n\n\nHe also received media flak for mocking Chinese people when interviewed about newcomer center Yao Ming. O'Neal told a reporter, \"you tell Yao Ming, ching chong yang, wah, ah so.\"[168] O'Neal later said it was locker room humor and he meant no offense. Yao believed that O'Neal was joking, but he said many Asians wouldn't see the humor.[169] Yao joked, \"Chinese is hard to learn. I had trouble with it when I was little.\"[170] O'Neal later expressed regret for the way he treated Yao early in his career.[171]\n\n\nDuring the 2005 NBA playoffs, O'Neal compared his poor play to Erick Dampier,[172] a Dallas Mavericks center who had failed to score a single point in one of their recent games. The quip inspired countless citations and references by announcers during those playoffs, though Dampier himself offered little response to the insult. The two would meet in the 2006 NBA Finals.[173]\n\n\nO'Neal was very vocal with the media, often making jabs at former Laker teammate Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2005, when asked about Bryant, he responded, \"I'm sorry, who?\" and continued to pretend that he did not know who Bryant was until well into the 2005–06 season.[174]\n\n\nO'Neal also appeared on television on *Saturday Night Live* (he was initially picked to host the second episode of season 24 in 1998, but had to back down due to scheduling conflicts, being replaced by Kelsey Grammer; however, he did appear in two sketches during the episode) and in 2007 hosted *Shaq's Big Challenge*, a reality show on ABC in which he challenged Florida kids to lose weight and stay in shape.\n\n\nWhen the Lakers faced the Heat on January 16, 2006, O'Neal and Bryant made headlines by engaging in handshakes and hugs before the game, an event that was believed to signify the end of the so-called \"Bryant–O'Neal feud\" that had festered since O'Neal left Los Angeles. O'Neal was quoted as saying that he accepted the advice of NBA legend Bill Russell to make peace with Bryant.[175] On June 22, 2008, O'Neal freestyled a diss rap about Bryant in a New York club. While rapping, O'Neal blamed Bryant for his divorce from his wife Shaunie and claims to have received a vasectomy, as part of a rhyme. He also taunted Bryant for not being able to win a championship without him. O'Neal led the audience to mockingly chant several times \"Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes\".[176] O'Neal justified his act by saying \"I was freestyling. That's all. It was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever. That is what MCs do. They freestyle when called upon. I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all.\"[177] Although even other exponents of hip hop, such as Snoop Dogg, Nas and Cory Gunz, agreed with O'Neal,[178] Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio expressed his intention to relieve O'Neal of his Maricopa County sheriff posse badge, due to \"use of a racially derogatory word and other foul language\". The racial quote from his song was \"it's like a white boy trying to be more nigga than me.\"[179]\n\n\n\n### Music career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Shaquille O'Neal + DIESEL (DJ)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game](image)DIESEL DJing at the 2018 All-Star Legends & Celebrity Softball Game\n |\n| Background information |\n| Genres | Hip hop, electronic dance music |\n| Occupation(s) | Rapper, DJ |\n| Years active | 1993–2001; 2017–present |\n| Labels | Jive, Interscope, A&M, Trauma, Monstercat |\n\n\nBeginning in 1993, O'Neal began to compose rap music. He released five studio albums and 1 compilation album. Although his rapping abilities were criticized at the outset,[180][181] one critic credited him with \"progressing as a rapper in small steps, not leaps and bounds\".[182] His 1993 debut album, *Shaq Diesel*, received platinum certification from the RIAA.\n\n\nO'Neal was featured alongside Michael Jackson as a guest rapper on \"2 Bad\", a song from Jackson's 1995 album *HIStory*. He contributed three tracks, including the song \"We Genie\", to the *Kazaam* soundtrack.[183] O'Neal was also featured in Aaron Carter's 2001 hit single \"That's How I Beat Shaq\". Shaq also appears in the music video for the release.[184]\n\n\nShaquille O'Neal conducted the Boston Pops Orchestra at the Boston Symphony Hall on December 20, 2010.\n\n\nO'Neal also started DJing in the 1980s at LSU.[185]\n\n\n\n#### As DJ Diesel[edit]\n\n\nCurrently, O'Neal produces electronic dance music and tours the world under the stage name DJ Diesel.[186]\n\n\nIn July 2017, O'Neal released a diss track aimed at LaVar Ball, the father of NBA point guard Lonzo Ball. The three-minute song was released in response to Ball claiming him and his younger son LaMelo, would beat O'Neal and his son Shareef in a game of basketball.\n\n\nOn October 23, 2021, O'Neal performed as DJ Diesel on the bassPOD stage at the 2021 Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, Nevada.[187][188][189]\n\n\nOn June 7, 2023, O'Neal released his first single as DJ Diesel from his debut album *Gorilla Warfare*, titled \"Bang Your Head\" in collaboration with Hairitage.[190] The album was released on August 18.[191]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal left LSU for the NBA after three years. However, he promised his mother he would eventually return to his studies and complete his bachelor's degree. He fulfilled that promise in 2000, earning his B.A. degree in general studies from LSU,[192] with a minor in political science.[193] Coach Phil Jackson let O'Neal miss a home game so he could attend graduation. At the ceremony, he told the crowd \"now I can go and get a real job\".\nSubsequently, O'Neal earned an online MBA degree through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In reference to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: \"It's just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else.\"[194]\n\n\nToward the end of his playing career, he began work on an educational doctorate at Barry University.[195][196] His doctoral capstone[197][198] topic was \"The Duality of Humor and Aggression in Leadership Styles\".[195][199] O'Neal received his Ed.D. degree in Human Resource Development from Barry in 2012.[200] O'Neal told a reporter for ABC News that he plans to further his education by attending law school.[201]\n\n\nIn 2009, O'Neal attended the Sportscaster U. training camp at S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, saying \"You have to know what you're doing... I needed to learn the secrets\".[202][203]\n\n\nO'Neal has also studied directing and cinematography with the New York Film Academy's Filmmaking Conservatory.[204]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal maintained a high level of interest in the workings of police departments and became personally involved in law enforcement. O'Neal went through the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Reserve Academy and became a reserve officer with the Los Angeles Port Police. \nOn March 2, 2005, O'Neal was given an honorary U.S. Deputy Marshal title and named the spokesman for the Safe Surfin' Foundation; he served an honorary role on the task force of the same name, which tracks down sexual predators who target children on the Internet.[205]\n\n\nUpon his trade to Miami, O'Neal began training to become a Miami Beach reserve officer. On December 8, 2005, he was sworn in, but elected for a private ceremony to avoid distracting attention from the other officers. He assumed a $1-per-year salary in this capacity.[206] Shortly thereafter, in Miami, O'Neal witnessed a hate crime (assaulting a man while calling out homophobic slurs) and called Miami-Dade police, describing the suspect and helping police, over his cell phone, track the offender.[206] O'Neal's actions resulted in the arrest of two suspects on charges of aggravated battery, assault, and a hate crime.[207]\n\n\nIn September 2006, O'Neal took part in a raid on a home in rural Bedford County, Virginia. O'Neal had been made an \"honorary deputy\" by the local sheriff's department. O'Neal was not qualified as a SWAT officer.[208]\n\n\nIn June 2008, the Bedford County, Virginia, and Maricopa County, Arizona, sheriff departments revoked O'Neal's special deputyship after a video surfaced of him rapping about Kobe Bryant and using racial slurs.[209][210]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2015, O'Neal was sworn in as a reserve officer for Doral, Florida's police force.[211] In December 2016, O'Neal was sworn in as a sheriff's deputy in Jonesboro, Georgia, as part of Clayton County, Georgia Sheriff's Department. O'Neal holds the county record of Tallest Sheriff's Deputy.[212]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nStarting with *Blue Chips* and *Kazaam*, O'Neal appeared in films that were panned by some critics.[213][214]\n\n\nO'Neal is one of the first African Americans to portray a major comic book superhero in a motion picture, having starred as John Henry Irons, the protagonist in the 1997 film *Steel*. He is preceded only by Michael Jai White, whose film *Spawn* was released two weeks before *Steel*.\n\n\nO'Neal appeared as himself on an episode of *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, bedridden after Larry David's character accidentally tripped him while stretching, and in two episodes each of *My Wife and Kids* and *The Parkers*.

After O'Neal and his wife went into a restaurant, Ashton Kutcher's crew members let the air out of O'Neal's tires. O'Neal and the crew member then got into an altercation and after Kutcher told O'Neal he had been Punk'd, O'Neal made an obscene gesture at the camera.[234][235]\n\n\nO'Neal starred in a reality show called *Shaq Vs.* which premiered on August 18, 2009, on ABC.[236] The show featured O'Neal competing against other athletes at their own sports.[237]\n\n\nOn July 14, 2011, O'Neal announced that he would join Turner Network Television (TNT) as an analyst on its NBA basketball games, joining Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley.[238]\n\n\nHe hosted the show *Upload with Shaquille O'Neal* which aired on TruTV for one season.\n\n\nIn September 2015 whilst promoting sportswear giant Reebok in South Korea, O'Neal joined the cast in the South Korean variety television show *Off to School* where he went to Seo Incheon High School.

According to Dave Meltzer of *Wrestling Observer Newsletter*, the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal.[260] Big Show later stated it was scheduling issues on O'Neal's part that caused the cancellation.[261]\n\n\nOn the November 11, 2020 episode of *AEW Dynamite*, Jade Cargill interrupted Cody Rhodes and teased the arrival of O'Neal in All Elite Wrestling (AEW).[262][263] He made a cameo appearance on *Being The Elite* and it was later confirmed that O'Neal had been appearing backstage at recent AEW tapings, including Full Gear.[264][265][266] He appeared on the December 9 episode of *AEW Dynamite* and addressed AEW in a sit-down interview with Tony Schiavone and Brandi Rhodes.[267] At the end of the interview, O'Neal got water thrown on him by Brandi after telling her to get pointers from Cargill, who had broken Brandi's arm several weeks ago.[268][269] On the March 3, 2021 episode of *AEW Dynamite* titled The Crossroads, O'Neal teamed with Jade Cargill to defeat Cody Rhodes and Red Velvet.

He described what has worked best for him in stock investing was where he felt a personal connection with the company.[273] O'Neal refused to endorse Wheaties cereal because he preferred Frosted Flakes.[272] He has also been an active real estate entrepreneur. O'Neal was looking to expand his business ventures with real-estate development projects aimed at assisting Orlando home owners facing foreclosure. His plans involved buying the mortgages of those who had fallen into foreclosure and then selling the homes back to them under more affordable terms. He would make a small profit in return, but wanted to make an investment in Orlando and help out homeowners.[274]\n\n\nIn conjunction with Boraie Development, O'Neal has developed projects in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, including, CityPlex12 and One Riverview.[275][276][277][278][279]\n\n\nO'Neal is on the advisory board for Tout Industries, a social video service startup company based in San Francisco.[133] He received the position in return for breaking news of his NBA retirement on the service.[280]\n\n\nIn September 2013, O'Neal became a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings.[281] In January 2022, O'Neal sold his stake in the Kings.[282]\n\n\nO'Neal was an early investor in Google.[272] In June 2015, he invested in technology startup Loyale3 Holdings Inc., a San Francisco brokerage firm whose website and mobile app enables companies to sell a piece of their IPOs directly to small investors who put up as a little as $100 and also allows investors to regularly buy small amounts of shares in already public companies.[273]\n\n\nO'Neal is an investor for esports team NRG Esports.[283] He has also appeared in television commercials promoting the *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* league *ELeague*.[284]\n\n\nO'Neal favors franchising businesses because of their simplicity and proven success.[272] In late 2016, he purchased the Krispy Kreme location at 295 Ponce de Leon Avenue in Atlanta.

In addition, he became the spokesperson for the company as part of the three-year contract.[289]\n\n\nIn 2021, O'Neal, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds as well as O'Neal's personal stake in the company. He, alongside other spokespeople, is currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[290][291][292] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[293]\n\n\nIn 2022, O'Neal premiered his halloween event in Long Beach called Shaqtoberfest.[294][295]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2010, O'Neal was sued by his personal IT technician, Shawn Darling, after O'Neal had allegedly attempted to plant child pornography on Darling's computer.[296][297][298][299] Darling claimed that O'Neal had originally tried to protect himself by hacking his mistresses' voicemails and deleting relevant messages. Darling also alleged that O'Neal had used law enforcement contacts to obtain restricted information on those mistresses, and that O'Neal subsequently threw his laptop into a lake to destroy possible evidence.[300] In 2017, a trial court ruled that Darling had not filed the lawsuit \"in good faith\", and that the accusations made by Darling occurred after he had attempted to extort $12,000,000 from O'Neal in return for thousands of stolen emails and electronic files.[301] Throughout the trial, Darling failed to submit adequate evidence to back up his claims. In 2021, the litigation ended with a court ruling that O'Neal was entitled to $412,914.50 in legal fees.[301]\n\n\nIn April 2014, O'Neal posted a photo on Instagram that showed himself mocking Jahmel Binion who suffers from Ectodermal dysplasia.[302][303] O'Neal issued a public apology, stating that he and Binion had spoken and that he's \"made a friend today\".[302] Binion would however go on to sue O'Neal for a sum larger than $25,000.[302] In 2016, Binion withdrew the lawsuit after coming to a settlement agreement with O'Neal.[304]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal at the 2009 NBA All-Star game\nO'Neal was raised by a Baptist mother and a Muslim stepfather and said that they taught him both.[305][306] Both Robin Wright in her book *Rock the Casbah* as well as the *Los Angeles Times* have identified O'Neal as a Muslim.[307][308][309] However, O'Neal has said, \"I'm Muslim, I'm Jewish, I'm Buddhist, I'm everybody 'cause I'm a people person.\"[310]\n\n\n\n### Marriage and children[edit]\n\n\nO'Neal married Shaunie Nelson on December 26, 2002. The couple have four children: Shareef (b. January 11, 2000), Amirah (b. November 13, 2001), Shaqir (b. April 19, 2003),[311] and Me'arah (b. May 1, 2006).[312][313] Nelson also has one son from a previous relationship, Myles. O'Neal has a daughter named Taahirah O'Neal (b. July 19, 1996)[314][315] from a previous relationship with his ex-girlfriend Arnetta Yardbourgh.[316]\n\n\nOn September 4, 2007, O'Neal filed for divorce from Shaunie in a Miami-Dade Circuit court. Shaunie later said that the couple was back together and that the divorce was withdrawn. However, on November 10, 2009, Shaunie filed an intent to divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.[317] The divorce was finalized in 2011. Shaq blames himself for the failed marriage and says he made mistakes and was \"greedy.\"[318]\n\n\nIn 2015, Shareef was seen in high school basketball highlights as a 6-foot-7-inch (2.01 m) freshman power forward, and had been described to have \"polar opposite playing style to his father\" due to his more athletic build and better shooting range.[319][320] Shareef played in college for the UCLA Bruins before transferring to LSU.[321]\n\n\n\n### Post-marriage relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn summer 2010, O'Neal began dating reality TV star Nicole \"Hoopz\" Alexander.[322][323] The couple resided at O'Neal's home in Sudbury, Massachusetts,[324] and later split in August 2012.[325][326]\n\n\nO'Neal began dating Laticia Rolle, a model, originally from Gardner, Massachusetts, in early 2014.[327] They later split in March 2018.[328]\n\n\n\n### Outside of basketball[edit]\n\n\n![](image)O'Neal in 2011\nIn June 2005 when Hall of Fame center George Mikan died, O'Neal, who considered Mikan to be a major influence, extended an offer to his family to pay all of the funeral expenses, which they accepted.[329]\n\n\nO'Neal is a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.\n\n\nO'Neal is a 2009 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame.[330] O'Neal became a Freemason in 2011, becoming a member of Widow's Son Lodge No. 28 in Boston.[331] O'Neal is a Prince Hall Freemason.[332][333][334]\n\n\nOn January 31, 2012, O'Neal was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[335]\n\n\nO'Neal's stepfather, Philip Arthur Harrison, died of a heart attack on September 10, 2013.[336]\n\n\nO'Neal is a fan of the National Hockey League's New Jersey Devils, who play in his hometown of Newark, and has been seen at several games over the years.[337] On January 11, 2014, O'Neal performed the ceremonial first puck and drove a Zamboni for a game between the Devils and the Florida Panthers.[338] O'Neal is also a fan of English football club Northampton Town, and has posted videos of support to their official YouTube page.[339]\n\n\nO'Neal is a fan of National Football League's Dallas Cowboys. According to him, football was actually his first sport and he wants to be like his idol, Ed \"Too Tall\" Jones.[340]\n\n\nIn 2016, O'Neal purchased a 14.3-acre, two-house compound in McDonough, Georgia for $1.15 million. It is around 30 miles southeast of Atlanta.[341]\n\n\nO'Neal endorsed Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie in his 2013 reelection bid, appearing in a television advertisement.[342] He participated in a virtual rally for then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and voted for the first time during the 2020 presidential election.[343]\n\n\nO'Neal turned down a $40 million deal with Reebok after hearing a mother complain about how expensive his shoes were.[344]\n\n\nIn July 2023 O'Neal purchased his first private jet; a $27 million Bombardier Challenger 650, complete with the iconic \"Dunkman\" logo on the tail.[345]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of career achievements by Shaquille O'Neal\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992–93 | Orlando | **81** | **81** | 37.9 | .562 | .000 | .592 | **13.9** | 1.9 | .7 | **3.5** | 23.4\n |\n| 1993–94 | Orlando | **81** | **81** | 39.8 | .599\\* | .000 | .554 | 13.2 | 2.4 | **.9** | 2.9 | 29.3\n |\n| 1994–95 | Orlando | 79 | 79 | 37.0 | .583 | .000 | .533 | 11.4 | 2.7 | **.9** | 2.4 | 29.3\\*\n |\n| 1995–96 | Orlando | 54 | 52 | 36.0 | .573 | **.500** | .487 | 11.0 | 2.9 | .6 | 2.1 | 26.6\n |\n| 1996–97 | L.A.

He led the Rockets to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. Olajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest centers, as well as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.[3][4][5]\n\n\nBorn in Lagos, Nigeria, Olajuwon traveled from his home country to play for the University of Houston under head coach Guy Lewis. His college career for the Cougars included three trips to the Final Four. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the 1984 NBA draft, a draft well known for its immense talent, which also included players such as Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton. He combined with the 7-foot-4-inch (224 cm) Ralph Sampson to form a duo dubbed the \"Twin Towers\". The two led the Rockets to the 1986 NBA Finals, where they lost in six games to the Boston Celtics. After Sampson was traded to the Golden State Warriors in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader. He led the league in rebounding twice (1989, 1990) and blocks three times (1990, 1991, 1993).\n\n\nDespite very nearly being traded during a bitter contract dispute before the 1992–93 season, he remained in Houston. He became the first non-American to be an NBA All-Star and start in an NBA All-Star Game, the first non-American to win the NBA MVP, the first non-American to win NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and, in the 1993–94 season, became the first player in NBA history to win the NBA's MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP awards in the same season. His Rockets won back-to-back championships. The Rockets' 1994 championship against the New York Knicks was the first in franchise history, with Olajuwon avenging his college championship loss to Patrick Ewing. The following year, after a lackluster regular season, Olajuwon's Rockets swept Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic in 4 games in the NBA Finals. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold medal-winning United States national basketball team, and he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. In October 2021, Olajuwon was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[6] He ended his career as the league's all-time leader in blocks (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a quadruple-double.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon was born to Salim and Abike Olajuwon, working-class Yoruba owners of a cement business in Lagos, Nigeria.[7][8] He was the third of eight children. He credits his parents with instilling virtues of hard work and discipline into him and his siblings: \"They taught us to be honest, work hard, respect our elders, and believe in ourselves.\"[7] Olajuwon has expressed displeasure at his childhood in Nigeria being characterized as backward. \"Lagos is a very cosmopolitan city ... There are many ethnic groups. I grew up in an environment at schools where there were all different types of people.\"[9]\n\n\nDuring his youth, Olajuwon was a soccer goalkeeper, which helped give him the footwork and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability.[10] Olajuwon did not play basketball until the age of 15 in high school, when he entered a local tournament while at the Muslim Teachers College in Lagos, Nigeria.[7] It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.[11]\n\n\nDespite early struggles, Olajuwon said: \"Basketball is something that is so unique. That immediately I pick up the game and, you know, realize that this is the life for me. All the other sports just become obsolete.\"[12]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon emigrated from Nigeria to play basketball at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered a visit to the university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play.[13] He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of only five numbers retired by the University of Houston men's basketball team, Olajuwon's No. 34 hangs in Fertitta Center.\nAfter redshirting his freshman year in 1980–81 because he could not yet get clearance from the NCAA to play,[9] Olajuwon came mostly off the bench and served as the Cougars' sixth man as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, averaging 8.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks, shooting 60% from the field in 18 minutes per game as Houston was eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina.[15] Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off-season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: \"The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.\"[9]\n\n\nOlajuwon returned from that summer a different player. He was nicknamed \"the Dream\" during his basketball career after he dunked so effortlessly that his college coach said it \"looked like a dream.\"[16] He and his teammates (including Clyde Drexler) formed what was dubbed \"Phi Slama Jama\", the first slam-dunking \"fraternity\", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive NCAA championship games, where they lost to North Carolina State on a last-second tip-in in 1983 and a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown team in 1984. He averaged 13.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, and 5.1 blocks in 1982–83 and 16.8 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 5.6 blocks in 1983–84.[15][17] Olajuwon was voted the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1983,[18] when he was also named the Helms Foundation Player of the Year.[19]\n\n\nAfter the 1983–84 season, when he was named a consensus first-team All-American,[17] Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time, before the NBA draft lottery was introduced in 1985, the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: \"I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the first draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).\"[14] His intuition proved correct, and the toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.\n\n\nIn his autobiography *Living the Dream*, Olajuwon mentions an intriguing draft trade offered to the Rockets that would have sent Clyde Drexler and the number two pick in the 1984 NBA draft from Portland in exchange for Ralph Sampson.[20] Had the Rockets made the deal, Olajuwon states the Rockets could have selected Jordan with the number two pick to play alongside Olajuwon and Drexler, who had established chemistry playing together during their Phi Slama Jama days in college. Sportswriter Sam Smith speculates that such a trade \"would have changed league history and maybe the entire Michael Jordan legend.\"[20] From 1991 to 1998, every NBA championship team included either Jordan or Olajuwon; furthermore, at least one of Drexler, Jordan, and Olajuwon was involved in every NBA Finals from 1990 to 1998.[21]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Houston Rockets (1984–2001)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rockets had immediate success during Olajuwon's rookie season, as their win–loss record improved from a 29-53 record in 1983–84 to 48–34 in 1984–85.[22] He teamed with the 1984 Rookie of the Year, 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) Ralph Sampson to form the original NBA \"Twin Towers\" duo. Olajuwon averaged 20.6 points, 11.9 rebounds and 2.68 blocks in his rookie season.[23] He finished as runner-up to Michael Jordan in the 1985 Rookie of the Year voting, and was the only other rookie to receive any votes.\n\n\nOlajuwon averaged 23.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 3.4 blocks per game during his second pro season (1985–86).[23] The Rockets finished 51–31,[22] and advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals where they faced the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets won the series fairly easily, four games to one, shocking the sports world and landing Olajuwon on the cover of *Sports Illustrated*. Olajuwon scored 75 points in victories in games three and four, and after the series Lakers coach Pat Riley remarked \"We tried everything. We put four bodies on him. We helped from different angles. He's just a great player.\"[24] The Rockets advanced to the 1986 NBA Finals where they lost in six games to the Boston Celtics, whose 1986 team is often considered one of the best teams in NBA history.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Mid-career years (1987–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olajuwon (right) defending Jawann Oldham on November 25, 1986\nDuring the 1987–88 season, Sampson (who was struggling with knee injuries that would eventually end his career prematurely) was traded to the Golden State Warriors. The 1988–89 season was Olajuwon's first full season as the Rockets' undisputed leader. This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney. The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45–37,[22] and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds (13.5 per game) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley. This performance was consistent with his averages of 24.8 points and 3.4 blocks.[26] Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37.5 ppg and 16.8 rpg, plus a record for points in a four-game playoff series (150).[27] Nevertheless, the Rockets were eliminated in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics, 3 games to 1.\n\n\nThe 1989–90 season was a disappointment for the Rockets. They finished the season with a 41–41 record,[22] and though they made the playoffs, were eliminated in four games by Los Angeles. Olajuwon put up one of the most productive defensive seasons by an interior player in the history of the NBA. He won the NBA rebounding crown (14.0 per game) again, this time by an even larger margin; a full two rebounds per game over David Robinson, and led the league in blocks by averaging 4.6 per game.[26] He is the only player since the NBA started recording blocked shots in 1973–74 to average 14+ rebounds and 4.5+ blocked shots per game in the same season. In doing so he joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton as the only players in NBA history (at that point) to lead the league in rebounding and shot-blocking in the same season.[27] Olajuwon also recorded a quadruple-double during the season,[28] becoming only the third player in NBA history to do so.\n\n\nThe Rockets finished the 1990–91 season with a record of 52–30[22] under NBA Coach of the Year Chaney. Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points per game in 1990–91, but due to an injury to his eyesocket caused by an elbow from Bill Cartwright,[7] did not play in enough games (56) to qualify for the rebounding title. Otherwise, he would have won it for a third consecutive year, averaging 13.8 a game (league leader Robinson averaged 13.0 rpg). He also averaged a league-leading 3.95 blocks per game.[29][30] However, the Rockets were swept in the playoffs by the LA Lakers.\n\n\nThe following season was a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon's tenure. They finished 42–40,[22] and missed the playoffs for the first time in Olajuwon's career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heartbeat.[31] Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a top center, and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation.[32] He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning.[33] Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation.[34] His agent cited his differences with the organization as being \"irreconcilable\",[35] and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office.[32][36] With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the *Houston Chronicle* said that Olajuwon being dealt was \"as close to a sure thing as there is.\"[37]\n\n\nNonetheless, he was not traded and the Rockets began the season with a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. Olajuwon improved his passing in 1992–93,[38] setting a new career-high of 3.5 assists per game.[26] This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. Olajuwon set a new career-high with 26.1 points per game.[26] The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins,[22] and advanced to the second round of the playoffs, pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime, 103–100. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley's 59.[39] The team rewarded him with a four-year contract extension toward the end of the regular season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship years (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon gained a reputation as a clutch performer and as one of the top centers in history based on his performances in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons.[41] He outplayed centers such as Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Dikembe Mutombo, and other defensive stalwarts such as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone. Many of his battles were with his fellow Texas-based rival David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs.[42] In the 30 head–to–head match-ups during the seven seasons from the 1989 to 1996, when both Olajuwon and Robinson were in their prime, Olajuwon averaged 26.3 points per game, shooting 47.6% from the field, while Robinson averaged 22.1 and 46.8%.\n\n\nOlajuwon led the Rockets to a championship in the 1994 NBA Finals in a seven-game series against the New York Knicks, the team of one of Olajuwon's perennial rivals since his collegiate days, Patrick Ewing. After being down 2–1, the Knicks took a 3–2 lead into Game 6. The Rockets were defending an 86–84 lead when in the last second, Knicks guard John Starks (who had already scored 27 points) went up for what would have been a Finals-winning three. Olajuwon pulled off a clutch play by blocking the shot as time expired.[43] In Game 7, Olajuwon posted a game–high 25 points and 10 rebounds, which helped defeat the Knicks, bringing the first professional sports championship to Houston since the Houston Oilers won the American Football League championship in 1961. Olajuwon dominated Ewing in their head–to–head match-up, outscoring him in every game of the series and averaging 26.9 points per game on 50% shooting, compared to Ewing's 18.9 and 36.3%.[44] For his efforts Olajuwon was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player.\n\n\nOlajuwon was at the pinnacle of his career. In 1994, he became the only player in NBA history to win the MVP, the Championship, the Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season.[45] He was also the first foreign-born player to win the league's MVP award.[46]\n\n\nOn December 1, 1994, Olajuwon recorded a triple-double 37 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 113–109 win over the Golden State Warriors.[47] But despite a slow start by the team, and Olajuwon missing eight games toward the end of the season with anemia,[48] the Rockets repeated as champions in 1995. They were bolstered in part by the acquisition of Clyde Drexler, Olajuwon's former University of Houston \"Phi Slama Jama\" teammate, in a mid-season trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon averaged 27.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 3.4 blocks per game during the regular season.[29] Olajuwon displayed perhaps the most impressive moments of his career during the playoffs. San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson, recently crowned league MVP, was outplayed by Olajuwon in the Conference Finals: Olajuwon averaged 35.3 points on .560 shooting (Robinson's numbers were 23.8 and .449) and outscored Robinson 81–41 in the final two games.[49] In the series-clinching game, Olajuwon recorded 39 points, 17 rebounds and 5 blocks.[50] When asked later what a team could do to \"solve\" Olajuwon, Robinson told *LIFE* magazine: \"Hakeem? You don't solve Hakeem.\"[7] The Rockets won every road game that series. In the NBA Finals, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic, who were led by a young Shaquille O'Neal. Olajuwon outscored O'Neal in every game,[44] scoring more than 30 points in each and raising his regular-season rate by five while O'Neal's production dropped by one.[51] Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP. He averaged 33.0 points on .531 shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.81 blocks in the 1995 Playoffs.[7] As in 1994, Olajuwon was the only Rockets All-Star.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Post-championship period (1995–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olajuwon signing autographs\nThe Rockets' two-year championship run ended when they were eliminated in the second round of the 1996 NBA Playoffs by the eventual Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics. Michael Jordan had returned from an 18-month hiatus in March 1995, and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years (1996–98). The Bulls and Rockets never met in the NBA Playoffs. The Rockets posted a 57–win season in 1996–97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster. They started the season 21–2,[53] but lost the Western Conference Finals in six games to the Utah Jazz. After averaging 26.9 and 23.2 points in 1995–96 and 1996–97 respectively, Olajuwon's point production dipped to 16.4 in 1997–98.[26] After the Rockets lost in the first round in five games to the Jazz in 1998,[54] Drexler retired. In 1998–99 the Rockets acquired veteran All-Star Scottie Pippen and finished 31–19 in the lockout-shortened regular season. Olajuwon's scoring production rose to 18.9 points per game,[26] and he made his twelfth and final All-NBA Team.[27] However, they lost in the first round again, this time to the Lakers.[55] After the season, Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nHouston began to rebuild, bringing in young guards Cuttino Mobley and 2000 NBA co-Rookie of the Year Steve Francis. On August 2, 2001,[56] after refusing a $13 million deal with the Rockets, Olajuwon was traded to the Toronto Raptors for draft picks (the highest of which was used by Houston to draft Boštjan Nachbar at #15 in the 2002 NBA draft), with the player having a three-year contract that would give him $18 million. In his first game with the Raptors, he scored 11 points in just 22 minutes of playing time against the Magic.[57] Olajuwon averaged career lows of 7.1 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in what would be his final season in the NBA, as he decided to retire in the fall of 2002, due to a back injury.[56][58] Olajuwon retired as the all–time league leader in total blocked shots with 3,830, although shot-blocking did not become an official statistic until the 1973–74 NBA season.\n\n\nShortly after his retirement, his No. 34 jersey was retired by the Rockets. For his NBA career, Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points on 51% shooting, 11.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 3.1 blocks in 1,238 career games.[59]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, before arriving in the US, Olajuwon played for a Nigerian junior team in the All-Africa Games. This created some problems when he tried to play for the United States men's national basketball team initially.[60] FIBA rules prohibit players from representing more than one country in international competition, and players must go through a three-year waiting period for any nationality change. Olajuwon was ineligible for selection to the \"Dream Team\" as he hadn't become a US citizen.[60]\n\n\nOlajuwon became a naturalized American citizen on April 2, 1993.[60] For the 1996 Olympics, he received a FIBA exemption and was eligible to play for Dream Team III. The team went on to win the gold medal in Atlanta. During the tournament, he shared his minutes with Shaquille O'Neal and David Robinson. He played 7 out of the 8 games and started 2. He averaged 5 points and 3.1 rebounds and had 8 assists and 6 steals in seven games.\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> If I had to pick a center [for an all-time best team], I would take Olajuwon. That leaves out Shaq, Patrick Ewing. It leaves out Wilt Chamberlain. It leaves out a lot of people. And the reason I would take Olajuwon is very simple: he is so versatile because of what he can give you from that position. It's not just his scoring, not just his rebounding or not just his blocked shots. People don't realize he was in the top seven [in NBA history] in steals. He always made great decisions on the court. For all facets of the game, I have to give it to him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Michael Jordan[61]\n\nOlajuwon was highly skilled as both an offensive and defensive player. On defense, his rare combination of quickness and strength allowed him to guard a wide range of players effectively. He was noted for both his outstanding shot-blocking ability and his unique talent (for a frontcourt player) for stealing the ball. Olajuwon is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 blocks and 200 steals in the same season. He averaged 3.09 blocks and 1.75 steals per game for his career.[56] He is the only center to rank among the top ten all-time in steals.[56] Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder, with a career average of 11.1 rebounds per game.[56] He led the NBA in rebounding twice, during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He was twice named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and was a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection. In 2022, the NBA renamed its Defensive Player of the Year award as The Hakeem Olajuwon Trophy.[62]\n\n\nOn offense, Olajuwon was famous for his deft shooting touch around the basket and his nimble footwork in the low post. With the ball, Hakeem displayed a vast array of fakes and spin moves, highlighted in his signature \"Dream Shake\" (see below). He was a prolific scorer, averaging 21.8 points per game for his career,[7] and an above-average offensive rebounder, averaging 3.3 offensive rebounds per game.[7] Additionally, Olajuwon became a skilled dribbler with an ability to score in \"face-up\" situations like a perimeter player.[63] He is one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double in the NBA, which have only been possible since the 1973–74 season, when blocked shots and steals were first kept as statistics in the NBA. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Olajuwon as the 11th greatest player in NBA history.[64]\n\n\n\n### *Dream Shake*[edit]\n\n\n\n> The best footwork I've ever seen from a big man.\n> \n> — Pete Newell[10]\n> \n\n\nOlajuwon established himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark *Dream Shake*. Executed with uncanny speed and power, they are still regarded as the pinnacle of \"big man\" footwork.[10] Shaquille O'Neal stated: \"Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves – that gives him 20 moves.\"[7] Olajuwon himself traced the move back to the soccer-playing days of his youth. \"The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot.\"[10] The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky-hook.[10]\n\n\nOne notable Dream Shake happened in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, drove to the basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.[65]\n\n\nOlajuwon has referred to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: \"When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I'm gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don't know that where I'm going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can't react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn't know where you're gonna turn and when.\"[66]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon married Dalia Asafi on August 8, 1996, in Houston.[67] The couple have four children together.[68] Olajuwon also has an older daughter, Abisola from a previous relationship with Lita Spencer, whom he met in college. Abisola represented the West Girls in the McDonald's All-American Game and played in the WNBA.[69]\n\n\nIn addition to English, Olajuwon is fluent in French, Arabic, and Yoruba.[46] He wrote his autobiography, *Living the Dream*, with co-author Peter Knobler in 1996. During his 18-year NBA career, Olajuwon earned more than $110 million in salary.[70]\n\n\nAfter Olajuwon’s rookie year he signed a 5 year agreement for $2.5 million, to endorse Etonic Shoes with a Signature line, the Dream Shoe. Later in his career signed a shoe endorsement deal with LA Gear, and became the face of Spalding's athletic shoe line and endorsed a sneaker that retailed in various outlets (such as Payless ShoeSource) for $34.99.[71] This made him one of the very few well-known players in any professional sport to endorse a sneaker not from Nike, Reebok, Adidas, or other high-visibility retail brands. As Olajuwon declared: \"How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or Reeboks that cost $120? ... She can't. So kids steal these shoes from stores and from other kids. Sometimes they kill for them.\"[72]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nAttending college was also an important priority to Olajuwon. At the University of Houston, Olajuwon was a physical education major.[73]\n\n\n\n### Muslim faith[edit]\n\n\nIn Olajuwon's college career and early years in the NBA, he was often undisciplined, talking back to officials, getting in minor fights with other players and amassing technical fouls. Later, Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality,[74] becoming a more devout Muslim. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, \"I'm not changing the spelling of my name, I'm correcting it\".[75] He later recalled, \"I studied the Qur'an every day. At home, at the mosque ... I would read it in airplanes, before games and after them. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. I didn't dabble in the faith, I gave myself over to it.\"[75] \"His religion dominates his life\", Drexler said in 1995.[76] Olajuwon was still recognized as one of the league's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month), which occurred during the playing season throughout his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month of Ramadan, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.[7][77]\n\n\n\n## Post-NBA life[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon played for 20 consecutive seasons in Houston, first collegiately for the University of Houston Cougars and then professionally with the Houston Rockets.[7] He is considered a Houston icon and one of the city's most beloved citizens.[78] Olajuwon has had great success in the Houston real estate market, with his estimated profits exceeding $100 million. He buys in cash-only purchases, as it is against Islamic law to pay interest.[79] Olajuwon splits his time between Jordan, where he moved with his family to pursue Islamic studies,[10] and his ranch near Houston.\n\n\nIn the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon opened his first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players the finer points of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never expressed an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, \"For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, make it easier for the entire team.\" He runs the camp for free.[80] Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor,[81] and center Yao Ming.[82][83] In September 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake.[84] In 2010, Olajuwon worked with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus.[85] In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon.[86][87] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried. In an interview with the Sporting News in April 2016, Olajuwon said that Kobe Bryant was his best low-post student. He stated, \"I’ve worked with a lot of players, but the one who really capitalized on it the most is Kobe Bryant. When I watch him play, he’ll go down in the post comfortably, naturally, and he’ll execute it perfectly.\"[88][89]\n\n\nOlajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2008. On April 10, 2008, the Rockets unveiled a sculpture in honor of him outside the Toyota Center.\n\n\nOlajuwon attended the 2013 NBA draft to bid farewell to retiring commissioner David Stern as Stern made his announcement for the final pick of the first round. Olajuwon was the first pick announced by Stern back in 1984.[90]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2015, Olajuwon made a special appearance for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game.[91] He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016.[92]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of career achievements by Hakeem Olajuwon\n\n* 2× NBA champion (1994, 1995)\n* 2× NBA Finals MVP (1994, 1995)\n* 1× NBA MVP (1994)\n* 2× NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1993, 1994)\n* 6× All-NBA First Team (1987, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1997)\n* 3× All-NBA Second Team (1986, 1990, 1996)\n* 3× All-NBA Third Team (1991, 1995, 1999)\n* 5× NBA All-Defensive First Team (1987, 1988, 1990, 1993, 1994)\n* 4× NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1985, 1991, 1996, 1997)\n* 12× NBA All-Star\n* Olympic gold medalist (1996)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History (1996).\n* Named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team\n* Olajuwon ended his career in the top eleven all-time in blocks, scoring, rebounding, and steals.

He led the Rockets to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. Olajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest centers, as well as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.[3][4][5]\n\n\nBorn in Lagos, Nigeria, Olajuwon traveled from his home country to play for the University of Houston under head coach Guy Lewis. His college career for the Cougars included three trips to the Final Four. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the 1984 NBA draft, a draft well known for its immense talent, which also included players such as Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton. He combined with the 7-foot-4-inch (224 cm) Ralph Sampson to form a duo dubbed the \"Twin Towers\". The two led the Rockets to the 1986 NBA Finals, where they lost in six games to the Boston Celtics. After Sampson was traded to the Golden State Warriors in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets' undisputed leader. He led the league in rebounding twice (1989, 1990) and blocks three times (1990, 1991, 1993).\n\n\nDespite very nearly being traded during a bitter contract dispute before the 1992–93 season, he remained in Houston. He became the first non-American to be an NBA All-Star and start in an NBA All-Star Game, the first non-American to win the NBA MVP, the first non-American to win NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and, in the 1993–94 season, became the first player in NBA history to win the NBA's MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP awards in the same season. His Rockets won back-to-back championships. The Rockets' 1994 championship against the New York Knicks was the first in franchise history, with Olajuwon avenging his college championship loss to Patrick Ewing. The following year, after a lackluster regular season, Olajuwon's Rockets swept Shaquille O'Neal's Orlando Magic in 4 games in the NBA Finals. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold medal-winning United States national basketball team, and he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. In October 2021, Olajuwon was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all-time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[6] He ended his career as the league's all-time leader in blocks (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a quadruple-double.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon was born to Salim and Abike Olajuwon, working-class Yoruba owners of a cement business in Lagos, Nigeria.[7][8] He was the third of eight children. He credits his parents with instilling virtues of hard work and discipline into him and his siblings: \"They taught us to be honest, work hard, respect our elders, and believe in ourselves.\"[7] Olajuwon has expressed displeasure at his childhood in Nigeria being characterized as backward. \"Lagos is a very cosmopolitan city ... There are many ethnic groups. I grew up in an environment at schools where there were all different types of people.\"[9]\n\n\nDuring his youth, Olajuwon was a soccer goalkeeper, which helped give him the footwork and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability.[10] Olajuwon did not play basketball until the age of 15 in high school, when he entered a local tournament while at the Muslim Teachers College in Lagos, Nigeria.[7] It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.[11]\n\n\nDespite early struggles, Olajuwon said: \"Basketball is something that is so unique. That immediately I pick up the game and, you know, realize that this is the life for me. All the other sports just become obsolete.\"[12]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon emigrated from Nigeria to play basketball at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered a visit to the university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play.[13] He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of only five numbers retired by the University of Houston men's basketball team, Olajuwon's No. 34 hangs in Fertitta Center.\nAfter redshirting his freshman year in 1980–81 because he could not yet get clearance from the NCAA to play,[9] Olajuwon came mostly off the bench and served as the Cougars' sixth man as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, averaging 8.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks, shooting 60% from the field in 18 minutes per game as Houston was eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina.[15] Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA's Houston Rockets, played games every off-season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: \"The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.\"[9]\n\n\nOlajuwon returned from that summer a different player. He was nicknamed \"the Dream\" during his basketball career after he dunked so effortlessly that his college coach said it \"looked like a dream.\"[16] He and his teammates (including Clyde Drexler) formed what was dubbed \"Phi Slama Jama\", the first slam-dunking \"fraternity\", so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive NCAA championship games, where they lost to North Carolina State on a last-second tip-in in 1983 and a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown team in 1984. He averaged 13.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, and 5.1 blocks in 1982–83 and 16.8 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 5.6 blocks in 1983–84.[15][17] Olajuwon was voted the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1983,[18] when he was also named the Helms Foundation Player of the Year.[19]\n\n\nAfter the 1983–84 season, when he was named a consensus first-team All-American,[17] Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time, before the NBA draft lottery was introduced in 1985, the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: \"I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the first draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).\"[14] His intuition proved correct, and the toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.\n\n\nIn his autobiography *Living the Dream*, Olajuwon mentions an intriguing draft trade offered to the Rockets that would have sent Clyde Drexler and the number two pick in the 1984 NBA draft from Portland in exchange for Ralph Sampson.[20] Had the Rockets made the deal, Olajuwon states the Rockets could have selected Jordan with the number two pick to play alongside Olajuwon and Drexler, who had established chemistry playing together during their Phi Slama Jama days in college. Sportswriter Sam Smith speculates that such a trade \"would have changed league history and maybe the entire Michael Jordan legend.\"[20] From 1991 to 1998, every NBA championship team included either Jordan or Olajuwon; furthermore, at least one of Drexler, Jordan, and Olajuwon was involved in every NBA Finals from 1990 to 1998.[21]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Houston Rockets (1984–2001)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years (1984–1987)[edit]\n\n\nThe Rockets had immediate success during Olajuwon's rookie season, as their win–loss record improved from a 29-53 record in 1983–84 to 48–34 in 1984–85.[22] He teamed with the 1984 Rookie of the Year, 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) Ralph Sampson to form the original NBA \"Twin Towers\" duo. Olajuwon averaged 20.6 points, 11.9 rebounds and 2.68 blocks in his rookie season.[23] He finished as runner-up to Michael Jordan in the 1985 Rookie of the Year voting, and was the only other rookie to receive any votes.\n\n\nOlajuwon averaged 23.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 3.4 blocks per game during his second pro season (1985–86).[23] The Rockets finished 51–31,[22] and advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals where they faced the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets won the series fairly easily, four games to one, shocking the sports world and landing Olajuwon on the cover of *Sports Illustrated*. Olajuwon scored 75 points in victories in games three and four, and after the series Lakers coach Pat Riley remarked \"We tried everything. We put four bodies on him. We helped from different angles. He's just a great player.\"[24] The Rockets advanced to the 1986 NBA Finals where they lost in six games to the Boston Celtics, whose 1986 team is often considered one of the best teams in NBA history.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Mid-career years (1987–1993)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olajuwon (right) defending Jawann Oldham on November 25, 1986\nDuring the 1987–88 season, Sampson (who was struggling with knee injuries that would eventually end his career prematurely) was traded to the Golden State Warriors. The 1988–89 season was Olajuwon's first full season as the Rockets' undisputed leader. This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney. The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45–37,[22] and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds (13.5 per game) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley. This performance was consistent with his averages of 24.8 points and 3.4 blocks.[26] Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37.5 ppg and 16.8 rpg, plus a record for points in a four-game playoff series (150).[27] Nevertheless, the Rockets were eliminated in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics, 3 games to 1.\n\n\nThe 1989–90 season was a disappointment for the Rockets. They finished the season with a 41–41 record,[22] and though they made the playoffs, were eliminated in four games by Los Angeles. Olajuwon put up one of the most productive defensive seasons by an interior player in the history of the NBA. He won the NBA rebounding crown (14.0 per game) again, this time by an even larger margin; a full two rebounds per game over David Robinson, and led the league in blocks by averaging 4.6 per game.[26] He is the only player since the NBA started recording blocked shots in 1973–74 to average 14+ rebounds and 4.5+ blocked shots per game in the same season. In doing so he joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton as the only players in NBA history (at that point) to lead the league in rebounding and shot-blocking in the same season.[27] Olajuwon also recorded a quadruple-double during the season,[28] becoming only the third player in NBA history to do so.\n\n\nThe Rockets finished the 1990–91 season with a record of 52–30[22] under NBA Coach of the Year Chaney. Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points per game in 1990–91, but due to an injury to his eyesocket caused by an elbow from Bill Cartwright,[7] did not play in enough games (56) to qualify for the rebounding title. Otherwise, he would have won it for a third consecutive year, averaging 13.8 a game (league leader Robinson averaged 13.0 rpg). He also averaged a league-leading 3.95 blocks per game.[29][30] However, the Rockets were swept in the playoffs by the LA Lakers.\n\n\nThe following season was a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon's tenure. They finished 42–40,[22] and missed the playoffs for the first time in Olajuwon's career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heartbeat.[31] Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a top center, and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation.[32] He also expressed displeasure with the organization's efforts to surround him with quality players. He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning.[33] Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation.[34] His agent cited his differences with the organization as being \"irreconcilable\",[35] and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team's front office.[32][36] With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the *Houston Chronicle* said that Olajuwon being dealt was \"as close to a sure thing as there is.\"[37]\n\n\nNonetheless, he was not traded and the Rockets began the season with a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. Olajuwon improved his passing in 1992–93,[38] setting a new career-high of 3.5 assists per game.[26] This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. Olajuwon set a new career-high with 26.1 points per game.[26] The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins,[22] and advanced to the second round of the playoffs, pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime, 103–100. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley's 59.[39] The team rewarded him with a four-year contract extension toward the end of the regular season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### MVP and championship years (1993–1995)[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon gained a reputation as a clutch performer and as one of the top centers in history based on his performances in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons.[41] He outplayed centers such as Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Dikembe Mutombo, and other defensive stalwarts such as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone. Many of his battles were with his fellow Texas-based rival David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs.[42] In the 30 head–to–head match-ups during the seven seasons from the 1989 to 1996, when both Olajuwon and Robinson were in their prime, Olajuwon averaged 26.3 points per game, shooting 47.6% from the field, while Robinson averaged 22.1 and 46.8%.\n\n\nOlajuwon led the Rockets to a championship in the 1994 NBA Finals in a seven-game series against the New York Knicks, the team of one of Olajuwon's perennial rivals since his collegiate days, Patrick Ewing. After being down 2–1, the Knicks took a 3–2 lead into Game 6. The Rockets were defending an 86–84 lead when in the last second, Knicks guard John Starks (who had already scored 27 points) went up for what would have been a Finals-winning three. Olajuwon pulled off a clutch play by blocking the shot as time expired.[43] In Game 7, Olajuwon posted a game–high 25 points and 10 rebounds, which helped defeat the Knicks, bringing the first professional sports championship to Houston since the Houston Oilers won the American Football League championship in 1961. Olajuwon dominated Ewing in their head–to–head match-up, outscoring him in every game of the series and averaging 26.9 points per game on 50% shooting, compared to Ewing's 18.9 and 36.3%.[44] For his efforts Olajuwon was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player.\n\n\nOlajuwon was at the pinnacle of his career. In 1994, he became the only player in NBA history to win the MVP, the Championship, the Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season.[45] He was also the first foreign-born player to win the league's MVP award.[46]\n\n\nOn December 1, 1994, Olajuwon recorded a triple-double 37 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 113–109 win over the Golden State Warriors.[47] But despite a slow start by the team, and Olajuwon missing eight games toward the end of the season with anemia,[48] the Rockets repeated as champions in 1995. They were bolstered in part by the acquisition of Clyde Drexler, Olajuwon's former University of Houston \"Phi Slama Jama\" teammate, in a mid-season trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon averaged 27.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 3.4 blocks per game during the regular season.[29] Olajuwon displayed perhaps the most impressive moments of his career during the playoffs. San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson, recently crowned league MVP, was outplayed by Olajuwon in the Conference Finals: Olajuwon averaged 35.3 points on .560 shooting (Robinson's numbers were 23.8 and .449) and outscored Robinson 81–41 in the final two games.[49] In the series-clinching game, Olajuwon recorded 39 points, 17 rebounds and 5 blocks.[50] When asked later what a team could do to \"solve\" Olajuwon, Robinson told *LIFE* magazine: \"Hakeem? You don't solve Hakeem.\"[7] The Rockets won every road game that series. In the NBA Finals, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic, who were led by a young Shaquille O'Neal. Olajuwon outscored O'Neal in every game,[44] scoring more than 30 points in each and raising his regular-season rate by five while O'Neal's production dropped by one.[51] Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP. He averaged 33.0 points on .531 shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.81 blocks in the 1995 Playoffs.[7] As in 1994, Olajuwon was the only Rockets All-Star.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Post-championship period (1995–2001)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olajuwon signing autographs\nThe Rockets' two-year championship run ended when they were eliminated in the second round of the 1996 NBA Playoffs by the eventual Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics. Michael Jordan had returned from an 18-month hiatus in March 1995, and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years (1996–98). The Bulls and Rockets never met in the NBA Playoffs. The Rockets posted a 57–win season in 1996–97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster. They started the season 21–2,[53] but lost the Western Conference Finals in six games to the Utah Jazz. After averaging 26.9 and 23.2 points in 1995–96 and 1996–97 respectively, Olajuwon's point production dipped to 16.4 in 1997–98.[26] After the Rockets lost in the first round in five games to the Jazz in 1998,[54] Drexler retired. In 1998–99 the Rockets acquired veteran All-Star Scottie Pippen and finished 31–19 in the lockout-shortened regular season. Olajuwon's scoring production rose to 18.9 points per game,[26] and he made his twelfth and final All-NBA Team.[27] However, they lost in the first round again, this time to the Lakers.[55] After the season, Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors (2001–2002)[edit]\n\n\nHouston began to rebuild, bringing in young guards Cuttino Mobley and 2000 NBA co-Rookie of the Year Steve Francis. On August 2, 2001,[56] after refusing a $13 million deal with the Rockets, Olajuwon was traded to the Toronto Raptors for draft picks (the highest of which was used by Houston to draft Boštjan Nachbar at #15 in the 2002 NBA draft), with the player having a three-year contract that would give him $18 million. In his first game with the Raptors, he scored 11 points in just 22 minutes of playing time against the Magic.[57] Olajuwon averaged career lows of 7.1 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in what would be his final season in the NBA, as he decided to retire in the fall of 2002, due to a back injury.[56][58] Olajuwon retired as the all–time league leader in total blocked shots with 3,830, although shot-blocking did not become an official statistic until the 1973–74 NBA season.\n\n\nShortly after his retirement, his No. 34 jersey was retired by the Rockets. For his NBA career, Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points on 51% shooting, 11.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 3.1 blocks in 1,238 career games.[59]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, before arriving in the US, Olajuwon played for a Nigerian junior team in the All-Africa Games. This created some problems when he tried to play for the United States men's national basketball team initially.[60] FIBA rules prohibit players from representing more than one country in international competition, and players must go through a three-year waiting period for any nationality change. Olajuwon was ineligible for selection to the \"Dream Team\" as he hadn't become a US citizen.[60]\n\n\nOlajuwon became a naturalized American citizen on April 2, 1993.[60] For the 1996 Olympics, he received a FIBA exemption and was eligible to play for Dream Team III. The team went on to win the gold medal in Atlanta. During the tournament, he shared his minutes with Shaquille O'Neal and David Robinson. He played 7 out of the 8 games and started 2. He averaged 5 points and 3.1 rebounds and had 8 assists and 6 steals in seven games.\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> If I had to pick a center [for an all-time best team], I would take Olajuwon. That leaves out Shaq, Patrick Ewing. It leaves out Wilt Chamberlain. It leaves out a lot of people. And the reason I would take Olajuwon is very simple: he is so versatile because of what he can give you from that position. It's not just his scoring, not just his rebounding or not just his blocked shots. People don't realize he was in the top seven [in NBA history] in steals. He always made great decisions on the court. For all facets of the game, I have to give it to him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Michael Jordan[61]\n\nOlajuwon was highly skilled as both an offensive and defensive player. On defense, his rare combination of quickness and strength allowed him to guard a wide range of players effectively. He was noted for both his outstanding shot-blocking ability and his unique talent (for a frontcourt player) for stealing the ball. Olajuwon is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 blocks and 200 steals in the same season. He averaged 3.09 blocks and 1.75 steals per game for his career.[56] He is the only center to rank among the top ten all-time in steals.[56] Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder, with a career average of 11.1 rebounds per game.[56] He led the NBA in rebounding twice, during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He was twice named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and was a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection. In 2022, the NBA renamed its Defensive Player of the Year award as The Hakeem Olajuwon Trophy.[62]\n\n\nOn offense, Olajuwon was famous for his deft shooting touch around the basket and his nimble footwork in the low post. With the ball, Hakeem displayed a vast array of fakes and spin moves, highlighted in his signature \"Dream Shake\" (see below). He was a prolific scorer, averaging 21.8 points per game for his career,[7] and an above-average offensive rebounder, averaging 3.3 offensive rebounds per game.[7] Additionally, Olajuwon became a skilled dribbler with an ability to score in \"face-up\" situations like a perimeter player.[63] He is one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double in the NBA, which have only been possible since the 1973–74 season, when blocked shots and steals were first kept as statistics in the NBA. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Olajuwon as the 11th greatest player in NBA history.[64]\n\n\n\n### *Dream Shake*[edit]\n\n\n\n> The best footwork I've ever seen from a big man.\n> \n> — Pete Newell[10]\n> \n\n\nOlajuwon established himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark *Dream Shake*. Executed with uncanny speed and power, they are still regarded as the pinnacle of \"big man\" footwork.[10] Shaquille O'Neal stated: \"Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves – that gives him 20 moves.\"[7] Olajuwon himself traced the move back to the soccer-playing days of his youth. \"The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot.\"[10] The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's sky-hook.[10]\n\n\nOne notable Dream Shake happened in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, drove to the basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.[65]\n\n\nOlajuwon has referred to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: \"When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I'm gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don't know that where I'm going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can't react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don't have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don't have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn't know which way I'm going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn't know where you're gonna turn and when.\"[66]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon married Dalia Asafi on August 8, 1996, in Houston.[67] The couple have four children together.[68] Olajuwon also has an older daughter, Abisola from a previous relationship with Lita Spencer, whom he met in college. Abisola represented the West Girls in the McDonald's All-American Game and played in the WNBA.[69]\n\n\nIn addition to English, Olajuwon is fluent in French, Arabic, and Yoruba.[46] He wrote his autobiography, *Living the Dream*, with co-author Peter Knobler in 1996. During his 18-year NBA career, Olajuwon earned more than $110 million in salary.[70]\n\n\nAfter Olajuwon’s rookie year he signed a 5 year agreement for $2.5 million, to endorse Etonic Shoes with a Signature line, the Dream Shoe. Later in his career signed a shoe endorsement deal with LA Gear, and became the face of Spalding's athletic shoe line and endorsed a sneaker that retailed in various outlets (such as Payless ShoeSource) for $34.99.[71] This made him one of the very few well-known players in any professional sport to endorse a sneaker not from Nike, Reebok, Adidas, or other high-visibility retail brands. As Olajuwon declared: \"How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or Reeboks that cost $120? ... She can't. So kids steal these shoes from stores and from other kids. Sometimes they kill for them.\"[72]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nAttending college was also an important priority to Olajuwon. At the University of Houston, Olajuwon was a physical education major.[73]\n\n\n\n### Muslim faith[edit]\n\n\nIn Olajuwon's college career and early years in the NBA, he was often undisciplined, talking back to officials, getting in minor fights with other players and amassing technical fouls. Later, Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality,[74] becoming a more devout Muslim. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, \"I'm not changing the spelling of my name, I'm correcting it\".[75] He later recalled, \"I studied the Qur'an every day. At home, at the mosque ... I would read it in airplanes, before games and after them. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. I didn't dabble in the faith, I gave myself over to it.\"[75] \"His religion dominates his life\", Drexler said in 1995.[76] Olajuwon was still recognized as one of the league's elite centers despite his strict observance of Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours for about a month), which occurred during the playing season throughout his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month of Ramadan, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.[7][77]\n\n\n\n## Post-NBA life[edit]\n\n\nOlajuwon played for 20 consecutive seasons in Houston, first collegiately for the University of Houston Cougars and then professionally with the Houston Rockets.[7] He is considered a Houston icon and one of the city's most beloved citizens.[78] Olajuwon has had great success in the Houston real estate market, with his estimated profits exceeding $100 million. He buys in cash-only purchases, as it is against Islamic law to pay interest.[79] Olajuwon splits his time between Jordan, where he moved with his family to pursue Islamic studies,[10] and his ranch near Houston.\n\n\nIn the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon opened his first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players the finer points of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never expressed an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, \"For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man's game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, make it easier for the entire team.\" He runs the camp for free.[80] Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor,[81] and center Yao Ming.[82][83] In September 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake.[84] In 2010, Olajuwon worked with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus.[85] In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon.[86][87] Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar'e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried. In an interview with the Sporting News in April 2016, Olajuwon said that Kobe Bryant was his best low-post student. He stated, \"I’ve worked with a lot of players, but the one who really capitalized on it the most is Kobe Bryant. When I watch him play, he’ll go down in the post comfortably, naturally, and he’ll execute it perfectly.\"[88][89]\n\n\nOlajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2008. On April 10, 2008, the Rockets unveiled a sculpture in honor of him outside the Toyota Center.\n\n\nOlajuwon attended the 2013 NBA draft to bid farewell to retiring commissioner David Stern as Stern made his announcement for the final pick of the first round. Olajuwon was the first pick announced by Stern back in 1984.[90]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2015, Olajuwon made a special appearance for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game.[91] He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016.[92]\n\n\n\n## Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of career achievements by Hakeem Olajuwon\n\n* 2× NBA champion (1994, 1995)\n* 2× NBA Finals MVP (1994, 1995)\n* 1× NBA MVP (1994)\n* 2× NBA Defensive Player of the Year (1993, 1994)\n* 6× All-NBA First Team (1987, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994, 1997)\n* 3× All-NBA Second Team (1986, 1990, 1996)\n* 3× All-NBA Third Team (1991, 1995, 1999)\n* 5× NBA All-Defensive First Team (1987, 1988, 1990, 1993, 1994)\n* 4× NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1985, 1991, 1996, 1997)\n* 12× NBA All-Star\n* Olympic gold medalist (1996)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History (1996).\n* Named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team\n* Olajuwon ended his career in the top eleven all-time in blocks, scoring, rebounding, and steals.

Webber played most of 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Sacramento Kings. Drafted number one overall by the Orlando Magic in the 1993 NBA draft, Webber became a 5-time NBA All-Star, a 5-time All-NBA Team member, and the NBA Rookie of the Year. He also played for the Golden \nState Warriors, Washington Bullets, Philadelphia 76ers, and Detroit Pistons.\n\n\nAs a collegiate athlete, he was a first-team All-American and led the Michigan Wolverines' 1991 incoming freshman class known as the Fab Five that reached the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship games as freshmen and sophomores. However, Webber was indicted by a federal grand jury and stripped of his All-American honors by the NCAA as a result of his direct involvement in the Ed Martin scandal.[1] He is also a former National High School Basketball Player of the Year who led his high school Detroit Country Day to three Michigan State High School Basketball Championships. He now does on-air commentary for NBA games, in addition to teaching at schools including Wake Forest University and Morehouse College. On May 16, 2021, after being eligible since 2013, it was announced Webber would be a part of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2021.[2][3] His youngest brother is David Webber.\n\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWebber attended Detroit Country Day School from 1987 to 1991 and at the time was the most recruited Michigan high school basketball player since Magic Johnson. Webber led Country Day to three MHSAA State championships. As a senior in high school Webber averaged 29.4 points and 13 rebounds per game. He was named Mr. Basketball of Michigan and the 1990–1991 National High School player of the year. He was named MVP in both the McDonald's and Dapper Dan All-Star games.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![five Black males in gold athletic uniforms in the foreground on the sidelines of an athletic court while a few opposing athletes in green wait in the middle of the court.](image)Michigan's Fab Five (left to right) Jimmy King, Jalen Rose, Webber, Ray Jackson and Juwan Howard\nAfter graduating from Detroit Country Day School, Webber attended the University of Michigan for two years. While a Michigan Wolverine, Webber led the group of players known as the Fab Five, which included himself, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. This group, all of whom entered Michigan as freshmen in the fall of 1991, took the basketball team to the NCAA finals twice, losing both times. The Fab Five, sporting long, baggy shorts and black socks, became immensely popular as they were seen as bringing a hip hop flavor to the game. Four of the Fab Five (Webber, Rose, Howard, and King) made it to the NBA. In their first season, the Fab Five led Michigan to an NCAA championship game against Duke, becoming the first team in NCAA history to compete in the championship with freshmen as all five starters.[4]\n\n\nOn April 5, 1993, at Michigan's second consecutive appearance at the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game with 11 seconds remaining, Webber brought the ball up the court into a half court trap. Michigan was down 73–71. Webber attempted to call for a timeout while his team had none remaining, resulting in a technical foul that effectively clinched the game for North Carolina.[5] Webber continues to receive ridicule for his time-out error; when he joined *Inside the NBA* in 2008, part of the humorous initiation ceremony was the question \"In college basketball how many timeouts do you get in a game?\" (Webber replied, \"I still don't know the answer!\")[6] His father has a license plate that says timeout.[7] The error was later referenced in the 2018 sports comedy film *Uncle Drew*, in which Webber played the role of Preacher.\n\n\nThe game marked the end of Webber's acclaimed two-year collegiate basketball career. In his second season, he was a first team All-American selection and a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year.[8] These awards and honors have been vacated due to University of Michigan and NCAA sanctions related to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. In that scandal, Webber received over $200,000 from a local booster while playing basketball for Michigan. Webber was convicted of perjury and banned from any affiliation with the Michigan program until 2013.[9]\n\n\nDespite the ban, Webber attended the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game between Michigan and Louisville. He apparently watched the game from a private suite, rather than in the grandstands near courtside, where the other members of the Fab Five watched the game together. Webber posted on Twitter before the game: \"I'm here at the Georgia Dome to show my support for the Michigan men's basketball team in its quest for a National Championship. I've known some of the players on the team since they were kids and I am excited for them and all of the student athletes on the court tonight who are wearing the Michigan uniform. It has been a great season and I wish them all the best.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### University of Michigan basketball scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Michigan basketball scandal\n\nIn 2002, Webber was charged for lying to a grand jury as part of a larger investigation of a numbers gambling operation, run by Michigan basketball program booster Ed Martin, in Ford Motor Company plants in the Detroit area. The investigation, originally focused on the numbers operation and tax evasion, soon widened to include the University of Michigan basketball program. Martin was convicted on counts of tax evasion and robbery and was scheduled to testify on the financial connections between himself and Webber at a sentencing hearing, but died of a heart attack before the hearing.\n\n\nAs a result of evidence admitted during the course of Martin's trial, Webber pleaded guilty to one count of criminal contempt for lying about his role in a scandal in which four players, including himself, had accepted illicit loans from Martin. Martin had been giving money to Webber since the 8th grade. He admitted in the plea that in 1994 he gave Martin about $38,000 in cash as partial repayment for expenditures Martin made on his behalf.[11] He was ordered to pay $100,000 and perform 330 hours of community service.\n\n\nDue to concerns that Webber's amateur status had been compromised, Michigan forfeited its victory in the 1992 Final Four over Cincinnati, as well as its runner-up status in the 1992 tourney. Michigan also forfeited the entire 1992–93 season, removed the 1992 and 1993 Final Four banners from the Crisler Arena rafters, and deleted Webber's records from its record book. The NCAA also ordered Michigan to disassociate itself from Webber until 2013. Webber later called Michigan's decision \"hurtful\" because he and his Fab Five teammates \"gave everything to Michigan\" while they played there.\n\n\nAfter Webber's plea, the Michigan State High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) recommended that Detroit Country Day forfeit all games in which Webber appeared (including three state championships), since according to his own admission, Webber had been accepting money from Martin since junior high school. The school conducted its own investigation, and called a press conference to announce it had found \"no credible evidence\" that Webber had accepted \"substantial\" amounts of cash from Martin while in high school, and therefore refused to forfeit any games. The MHSAA claimed it had no legal authority to force the games to be forfeited.\n\n\nWebber was suspended by the NBA for a total of eight games—five for an unnamed violation of the league substance abuse policies and three for lying to the grand jury. Webber received the suspensions once he recovered from an injury that kept him out for half of the 2003–04 season.\n\n\nThe scandal was explored in a documentary by ESPN Films called *The Fab Five*, which aired in March 2011. In it, the University of Michigan repeated its position that it would not associate with Webber until he publicly apologized for his part in the Ed Martin scandal, with the self-imposed 10-year ban on its association with the remainder of the players ending in 2013. Webber declined to participate in the documentary.\n\n\nWebber made his first post-ban public appearance at the University of Michigan on November 3, 2018, when he was invited by football coach Jim Harbaugh to participate as an honorary captain for its game against Penn State; Webber was warmly received at Michigan Stadium. Of the experience, Webber said on NBA TV, \"Tell you what, fellas, this was a great moment, in front of 100,000 people. I had goosebumps and chills, and definitely some watery eyes.\"[12] Webber also spent time with the football program as its guest before the game. He did not meet with the Michigan basketball team or staff, but despite this, head coach John Beilein stated that \"I think it was a great step in the right direction that he was here.\"[13] After Juwan Howard, teammate of Webber from the Fab Five, took over as head coach in 2019, Webber indicated to TMZ that he is open to reconciling with Michigan basketball and said, \"Howard is my friend.... and therefore, I put pride aside\", but wants his return to the Crisler Arena to be private.[14]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nWebber was selected by the Orlando Magic with the first pick of the 1993 NBA draft, becoming the first sophomore since Magic Johnson to be a #1 overall draft pick.[8] The Magic immediately traded him to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Penny Hardaway and three future first round draft picks. Over his 15-year NBA career, Webber made $178 million.[15]\n\n\nWebber had an outstanding first year, averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game and winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He was instrumental in leading the Warriors back into the playoffs where they were swept by the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns in three games. However, he had a long-standing conflict with his coach, Don Nelson.[16] Nelson wanted to make Webber primarily a post player, despite Webber's superb passing ability and good ball handling skills for someone his size at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall. Webber also disliked playing a substantial amount of time at center, given Nelson's propensity towards smaller, faster line ups. In the 1994 off-season, the Warriors acquired Rony Seikaly so that Webber could play primarily at power forward. However, at the time, the differences between Webber and Nelson were considered to be irreconcilable. Webber exercised a one-year escape clause in his contract, stating he had no intention of returning to the Warriors. With few alternatives, Golden State agreed to a sign-and-trade deal, sending Webber to the Washington Bullets (renamed the Wizards in 1997) for forward Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft picks. The three draft picks included two of the picks the Warriors had traded to the Magic to obtain Webber in the first place, as the Magic had included those picks in a trade package with the Bullets less than 4 months earlier.[17]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets / Wizards (1994–1998)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Washington Bullets, Webber was reunited with his college teammate and friend, Juwan Howard. He spent the next three years with the Bullets (later renamed the Washington Wizards), although in the 1995–96 season injuries limited him to only 15 games. Webber rebounded the following year and was named to his first All-Star team in 1997. The same season, Webber led the Bullets into the playoffs for the first time in nine years, but they were swept by the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in three games. By 1998, Webber had established himself as a great power forward, but his time in Washington had also worn out.\n\n\n\n### Sacramento Kings (1998–2005)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

In his first year with the Kings (the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season), Webber won the rebounding title averaging a league high 13.0 rebounds per game, ending Dennis Rodman's seven-year run as the NBA's rebound leader. Under the guidance of Rick Adelman, the Kings team made it into the 1999 Playoffs, where they lost to the Utah Jazz led by future hall of famers Karl Malone and John Stockton.\n\n\nIn years to come, Webber and the Kings became one of the league's top franchises, and NBA title contenders. He was named to the All-Star team again in 2000 and 2001 while cementing his status as one of the premier power forwards in the NBA. For the 1999–2000 season Webber was the cover athlete on *NBA Jam 2000*; that season, Webber led the Kings to 44 wins improving their win column from a year before, and into the first round of the 2000 Playoffs where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers. After losing the first two games of the series in Los Angeles, the Kings won the next two in Sacramento, including 23 points, 14 rebounds, 7 blocks, 8 assists and 4 steals from Webber in game four, to send the series back to Los Angeles for a deciding game 5. The Kings lost Game 5 and the series to the Lakers who went on to win the championship that year.\n\n\nWebber peaked in the 2000–01 season, when he averaged a career-high 27.1 points. He also averaged 11.1 rebounds and was fourth in MVP voting, while starting at forward for the Western Conference All-Star Team in the 2001 All-Star Game in Washington. In the 2001 Playoffs, Webber and the Kings defeated the Phoenix Suns in four games of the first round to advance to the second round (first time of his career he advanced past the first round), where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers for a second year in a row. The Kings lost in four games to the Lakers despite Webber's 21 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists in game four.\n\n\nOn July 27, 2001, Webber signed a seven-year, $127 million contract with the Kings. In the 2001–02 season, Webber played in 54 games leading the Kings to a Pacific division title and a franchise-record (and league-best) 61–21 season. He also made his fourth All-Star team and the All-NBA Second Team. In the 2002 Playoffs the Kings defeated the Utah Jazz in four games and Dallas Mavericks in five games in the first two rounds en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals against their archrivals, the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, a series that would prove to be one of the most memorable (and most controversial) in NBA History. The series was nip and tuck all the way as both teams traded wins in the first six games of the series as the Lakers won games one, four (highlighted by the game winner from Robert Horry) and six (a game which featured many controversial calls, including a late-game foul on Mike Bibby after he was bleeding from being elbowed in the nose by Bryant. All told, the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter. Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy filed in court papers in 2008 said that Game 6 was fixed by the NBA. NBA Commissioner David Stern denied Donaghy's allegations. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led a review of the league's officiating following the outbreak of the scandal, concluded that while Game 6 was poorly officiated, no concrete evidence existed of it having been fixed.[19]), while the Kings won games two, three and five, including 29 points, 13 rebounds and 3 assists from Webber plus the game-winner from teammate Mike Bibby in game five, heading into the deciding seventh game back at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, a game which would prove to be most memorable of the series. The game was nip and tuck all the way with Webber recording 20 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 2 blocks and 1 steal and Bryant and O'Neal recording 30 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 steals, with 35 points, 13 rebounds, 4 blocks and 2 assists, respectively, as the game went into overtime with missed shots from teammates Stojakovic and Doug Christie, boiling to the last minutes of the game with Webber fouling O'Neal with 1:27 left in overtime causing O'Neal to make both free throws and the Kings would go on to lose Game 7 of the series at home. It was the closest that Webber ever got to a championship.\n\n\nIn the next season, Webber averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds per game. He was cited as a possible MVP candidate, and made his fifth consecutive All-Star team. In a bad sign of what was to come, Webber missed the All Star game with a sprained ankle. Nevertheless, he returned and the Kings were among the favorites to win the NBA Championship. In the second game of the 2003 Western Conference Semifinals against the Dallas Mavericks, Webber suffered a career-threatening knee injury while running down the lane untouched that forced him to miss nearly a year of action. This shattered the Kings' title hopes, and they lost the series in seven games.\n\n\nAfter microfracture surgery, he returned for the final 24 games of the 2003–04 season, in which he led the Kings (who went 55-27 that season) into the 2004 Playoffs where they faced their archrivals the Dallas Mavericks for the third year in a row, the Kings defeated the Mavericks in five thrilling entertaining games in the first round en route to reaching the Western Conference Semifinals against the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves led by league MVP Kevin Garnett, a series that would prove to be one of the most memorable in NBA history. Each game was neck and neck with both teams trading wins in the first six games of the series as the Timberwolves won games two, three and five, while the Kings won games one, four and six, including 28 points, 8 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 steals and 1 block from Webber in game four, heading into the deciding seventh game back at the Target Center in Minnesota, a game which would prove to be the most memorable of the series. The game was indecisively close throughout the first three quarters, with Webber recording 16 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 steal, and Garnett on the other hand recording 32 points, 21 rebounds, 2 assists, 4 steals and 5 blocks. The game boiled down to the last play of the game with the Kings trailing the Timberwolves by 3 with 2.5 seconds left in the game. After receiving an inbounds pass Webber pump-faked Garnett in the air and got a clean look as Garnett avoided contact for a three-point shot that rimmed out as the final buzzer sounded and the Kings lost Game 7 and the series, marking the third year in a row that the Kings lost a deciding game 7. It turned out to be the last chance the Webber-led Kings had to win a championship and he was traded the following season thus resulting in the team being dismantled the following season.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (2005–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2005, Webber was traded, along with Michael Bradley and Matt Barnes, to the Philadelphia 76ers for power forward Kenny Thomas, forward/center Brian Skinner, and former King Corliss Williamson.[20] Webber took some time to fit in with the 76ers' system, which was geared toward star guard Allen Iverson.[21] While the Sixers reached the 2005 playoffs, they lost to the Detroit Pistons.[22] In the 21 games he played for Philadelphia in 2005, Webber averaged 15.6 points and 7.9 rebounds per game on 39.1% shooting.[15] Following the 2003 microfracture surgery on his knee, Webber had lost lateral quickness and was seen as a defensive liability.[23]\n\n\nIn 2006, Webber put up a resurgent 20 points and 9.9 rebounds per game in 75 games for Philadelphia.[24][15] Nevertheless, the team missed the playoffs,[25] finishing with a 38–44 record.[26] On Tuesday, April 18, 2006, Webber and Iverson were fined for not showing up at the Philadelphia 76ers' final home game of the season, which was Fan Appreciation Night, although both of them were injured and not expected to play.[27] The following day, they both apologized for being absent.[28]\n\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, Webber's role was reduced, and he was benched in the fourth quarter of multiple games. In November 2006, ESPN reported that \"Webber's minutes and production had \"dramatically declined\", and that coach Maurice Cheeks had \"turned him into a $20 million role player\". Webber discussed his frustration with team president Billy King, but claimed he was not requesting a trade.[24] During the 2006–07 season, Webber only played 18 of 35 games for the Sixers, leading the media[*who?*] to question his motivation. On January 11, 2007, King announced that the Sixers and Webber had agreed to a reported $25 million contract buyout on the remaining two years left on his contract, in effect paying him not to play. Later that day, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2007)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2007, Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons.[29] He has stated throughout his career that he always wanted to play for his hometown team. His usual number 4 had been retired in honor of Joe Dumars, so Webber donned the number 84, because his nephew had a dream of him making a buzzer beater with that number on. The Pistons were a much improved basketball team after Webber's acquisition, improving their record in the Eastern Conference and solidifying the first seed in the East. However, the Eastern Conference favorites failed to advance to the finals after losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the \nEastern Conference Finals, leaving Webber short of an NBA Finals appearance yet again. Indeed, Webber performed well in the 2007 Playoffs despite receiving limited minutes. Webber still managed to average 10 points and 6 rebounds per game in the playoffs and shot an impressive 52.4% from the field. His efforts were highlighted by a game 5 performance in the Eastern Conference Finals in which Webber scored 20 points (including 5 points in the double-overtime period) on 9 of 13 shooting and grabbed 7 boards. Nevertheless, Detroit still lost what turned out to be the key game in the series in double overtime and Webber ended up averaging a career low 11.2 PPG in his run with the Pistons. During the off-season, Detroit did not re-sign Webber. Despite receiving lucrative proposals from teams in Europe, he was in free agency at the beginning of the regular season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Return to Golden State (2008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Webber (right) playing for the Warriors in 2008\nOn January 29, 2008, the Golden State Warriors signed Webber for the rest of the season.[30][31][32] Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the *San Francisco Chronicle* reported that he would receive the pro-rated veteran's minimum of $1.2 million[33] (approximately $570,000).[34] This came after a rejected offer by the Los Angeles Lakers who were trying to coax Webber in with two 10-day contracts so they could decide afterwards if they wanted him the rest of the season.[31] This also put to rest talks of joining the Detroit Pistons, Dallas Mavericks, or retirement.[35] He played in only nine games for the Warriors, averaging 3.9 points and 3.6 rebounds in 14 minutes per game.[15]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2008, Webber retired from basketball due to persistent problems with his surgically repaired knee and was waived by the Warriors.[36]\nOn March 27, 2008, Webber made his first appearance on television on Inside the *NBA on TNT*, alongside Charles Barkley and host Ernie Johnson. On April 25, 2008, TNT offered Webber a job to be a commentator for the postseason.\n\n\nOn February 6, 2009, Webber returned to ARCO Arena, home of the Sacramento Kings, to participate in the ceremonies surrounding the retirement of his jersey, #4.[37]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nWebber ranked #64 in *SLAM Magazine'*s Top 75 NBA players of all time in 2003 and ranked #11 in an ESPN.com experts poll of the top power forwards of all time in 2005.[38] He also ranked #72 on a list of the Top 96 NBA players of all time in Bill Simmons' 2009 bestseller *The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy*.[39] In 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Webber as the 65th greatest player in NBA history.[40]\n\n\nThe Sacramento Kings retired Webber's number 4 jersey on February 6, 2009, when the Kings hosted the Utah Jazz.[41]\n\n\nWebber was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.[42]\n\n\nWebber's youngest brother, David, matched his total with 3 Michigan High School Athletic Association state championships (1995–97),[43] and became Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year.[44]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball life[edit]\n\n\nSince retiring from the NBA, Webber became an analyst on NBA TV's *NBA Gametime Live*. He did the Tuesday Fan Night alongside Ernie Johnson and Kevin McHale. He also served as an occasional guest analyst (primary) on TNT's *Inside the NBA* from 2008 to 2021.[45][*circular reference*] During Charles Barkley's leave of absence, Webber substituted for him along with other guests such as Gary Payton and Mike Fratello. Since 2017, he was also a regular panelist during NBA on TNT's Monday coverage called *Players Only*, which features only former NBA players as studio analysts, play-by-play announcers, and color analysts for games.[46] In 2021, Webber parted ways with TNT on the eve of the NBA playoffs.[47][48] Webber has expressed interest in eventually becoming a GM and owner.[49]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Webber played in the NBA Asia Challenge 2010 at Araneta Coliseum in Metro Manila, an exhibition game which pitted NBA legends and NBA Development League players against Philippine Basketball Association stars and legends.[50]\n\n\nWebber was the owner of Center Court With C-Webb,[51] a restaurant in Sacramento, California. Opening in 2006,[52] the restaurant closed on November 17, 2009 [53] falling victim to the Great Recession.[54]\n\n\nEarlier that year, Webber married his longtime girlfriend Erika Dates during a private ceremony at his Atlanta home. In attendance were 200 guests including family and close friends.\n\n\nIn 2015, Chris Webber was the executive producer for the independent romantic-drama film *Somewhere in the Middle* by Lanre Olabisi. Webber has also tried his hand at music production, producing Nas's tracks \"Surviving the Times\" from his *Greatest Hits* album and \"Blunt Ashes\" from *Hip Hop Is Dead*.\n\n\nIn late 2016, Webber began hosting *Fearless or Insane* on Podcast One.[55] In 2018, with old age makeup, he played the role of Preacher in the film *Uncle Drew*, which starred Kyrie Irving.\n\n\nIn 2016, Webber began work as a professor of practice at Wake Forest University, teaching a class in sports storytelling.[56] In 2021 he began teaching at Morehouse College, instructing an online course on athlete activism.[57]\n\n\nIn 2021 Webber announced the launch of a private equity fund for investing in minority-owned cannabis businesses. He stated: \"It's crucial that we diversify leadership within the cannabis industry and level the playing field for people from our communities. For far too long, minorities have been excessively punished and incarcerated for cannabis while others profited.\"[58][59] In 2022 he announced the launch of \"Players Only\", a cannabis brand that will feature flower strains, cartridges, pre-rolls, vapes, sport recovery and performance products, apparel, and more.[60][61]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### African-American artifacts[edit]\n\n\nWebber has a personal collection of African-American artifacts which he began collecting in 1994. He began collecting them upon entering the NBA, starting with the purchase of two slave records. Webber believes that these artifacts are a reflection of his beliefs and aspirations. He initially collected them as encouragements to face life obstacles. However, he had no intentions on exhibiting them until the growth of his collection prompted additional storage. His collection includes an original 1901 publication of an autobiography by Booker T. Washington, and various documents, letters, and postcards signed by Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. When not on public exhibit, the artifacts are stored at the Sacramento Public Library's Archival Vault. In previous years, the Chris Webber Collection has been featured in Crocker Art Museum and Wayne State University.[62]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2007, Webber unveiled his collection of African-American artifacts during the Celebrating Heritage Exhibition at Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. During a news conference, Webber said he believed that children can learn from these artifacts, \"Hopefully, when children see them they will see there is no excuse for us not to be successful. There's no excuse not to find something that you love to do. There's no excuse to not work hard at it.\"[63]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nWebber is active in various charities and created The Timeout Foundation in 1993. The foundation's mission is to provide positive educational and recreational opportunities to youth.\n\n\nIn 1999, Webber created C-Webb's Crew where a group of tickets at every Kings regular home season game would be donated to at-risk youth and their families. To date, over 3,000 youths and their families have attended a game through C-Webb's Crew.\n\n\nCommunity awards Webber has won include the inaugural Sacramento Kings/Oscar Robertson Triple Double Award, which is annually awarded to a Kings player who exemplifies: team leadership, all-around game, and sportsmanship; the NBA Community Assist Award for his contributions in February 2003, and the Wish Maker of the Year in 2003 awarded by the Sacramento Chapter of the Make a Wish Foundation.\n\n\nWebber held a celebrity weekend, Bada Bling!, at the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. The event was held from July 28–30, 2006, and included a live auction and celebrity poker tournament. Many renowned NBA players participated including then-current and former teammates: Mike Bibby, Brad Miller, Andre Iguodala, Bobby Jackson, Kyle Korver, and his then-current coach, Maurice Cheeks. Other notable participants included Charles Barkley, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gary Payton, Kenny Smith, Moses Malone, and Stephon Marbury. Numerous entertainers attended as well such as Nas and Common. All of the proceeds were donated to The Timeout Foundation.\n\n\nWebber hosted his 2nd annual Bada Bling charity weekend from July 20–22, 2007, at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.[64]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Webber was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of marijuana and five other traffic-related violations after being pulled over for speeding on the way to the practice center at the MCI Center in downtown Washington, D.C. Webber was eventually acquitted by a jury of the assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana and driving under the influence charges, and paid $560 in fines for lesser violations.[65]\n\n\nLater in 1998 during the off-season, while leaving Puerto Rico on a promotional tour for Fila sneakers, Webber paid a $500 fine after U.S. Customs found marijuana in his bag. Soon after Fila dropped Webber as an endorser, a three-member panel of arbitrators awarded Webber $2.61 million for breach of contract.\n\n\nAfter the closing of his first restaurant, property owner Promenade filed a $3 million lawsuit in 2010. The claims were for violating terms of a 20-year lease signed in 2005. Promenade was seeking funds to help re-lease the property and overdue rent.[54]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nWebber also has produced hip hop records, including two songs for rapper Nas: \"Blunt Ashes\" and \"Surviving the Times\" and appeared on the skit Webber from Naughty by Nature's Grammy Award-winning album Poverty's Paradise.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Album information\n |\n| --- |\n| ***2 Much

Webber played most of 15 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the Sacramento Kings. Drafted number one overall by the Orlando Magic in the 1993 NBA draft, Webber became a 5-time NBA All-Star, a 5-time All-NBA Team member, and the NBA Rookie of the Year. He also played for the Golden \nState Warriors, Washington Bullets, Philadelphia 76ers, and Detroit Pistons.\n\n\nAs a collegiate athlete, he was a first-team All-American and led the Michigan Wolverines' 1991 incoming freshman class known as the Fab Five that reached the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship games as freshmen and sophomores. However, Webber was indicted by a federal grand jury and stripped of his All-American honors by the NCAA as a result of his direct involvement in the Ed Martin scandal.[1] He is also a former National High School Basketball Player of the Year who led his high school Detroit Country Day to three Michigan State High School Basketball Championships. He now does on-air commentary for NBA games, in addition to teaching at schools including Wake Forest University and Morehouse College. On May 16, 2021, after being eligible since 2013, it was announced Webber would be a part of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2021.[2][3] His youngest brother is David Webber.\n\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\nWebber attended Detroit Country Day School from 1987 to 1991 and at the time was the most recruited Michigan high school basketball player since Magic Johnson. Webber led Country Day to three MHSAA State championships. As a senior in high school Webber averaged 29.4 points and 13 rebounds per game. He was named Mr. Basketball of Michigan and the 1990–1991 National High School player of the year. He was named MVP in both the McDonald's and Dapper Dan All-Star games.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![five Black males in gold athletic uniforms in the foreground on the sidelines of an athletic court while a few opposing athletes in green wait in the middle of the court.](image)Michigan's Fab Five (left to right) Jimmy King, Jalen Rose, Webber, Ray Jackson and Juwan Howard\nAfter graduating from Detroit Country Day School, Webber attended the University of Michigan for two years. While a Michigan Wolverine, Webber led the group of players known as the Fab Five, which included himself, Juwan Howard, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson. This group, all of whom entered Michigan as freshmen in the fall of 1991, took the basketball team to the NCAA finals twice, losing both times. The Fab Five, sporting long, baggy shorts and black socks, became immensely popular as they were seen as bringing a hip hop flavor to the game. Four of the Fab Five (Webber, Rose, Howard, and King) made it to the NBA. In their first season, the Fab Five led Michigan to an NCAA championship game against Duke, becoming the first team in NCAA history to compete in the championship with freshmen as all five starters.[4]\n\n\nOn April 5, 1993, at Michigan's second consecutive appearance at the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game with 11 seconds remaining, Webber brought the ball up the court into a half court trap. Michigan was down 73–71. Webber attempted to call for a timeout while his team had none remaining, resulting in a technical foul that effectively clinched the game for North Carolina.[5] Webber continues to receive ridicule for his time-out error; when he joined *Inside the NBA* in 2008, part of the humorous initiation ceremony was the question \"In college basketball how many timeouts do you get in a game?\" (Webber replied, \"I still don't know the answer!\")[6] His father has a license plate that says timeout.[7] The error was later referenced in the 2018 sports comedy film *Uncle Drew*, in which Webber played the role of Preacher.\n\n\nThe game marked the end of Webber's acclaimed two-year collegiate basketball career. In his second season, he was a first team All-American selection and a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year.[8] These awards and honors have been vacated due to University of Michigan and NCAA sanctions related to the University of Michigan basketball scandal. In that scandal, Webber received over $200,000 from a local booster while playing basketball for Michigan. Webber was convicted of perjury and banned from any affiliation with the Michigan program until 2013.[9]\n\n\nDespite the ban, Webber attended the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship game between Michigan and Louisville. He apparently watched the game from a private suite, rather than in the grandstands near courtside, where the other members of the Fab Five watched the game together. Webber posted on Twitter before the game: \"I'm here at the Georgia Dome to show my support for the Michigan men's basketball team in its quest for a National Championship. I've known some of the players on the team since they were kids and I am excited for them and all of the student athletes on the court tonight who are wearing the Michigan uniform. It has been a great season and I wish them all the best.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### University of Michigan basketball scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Michigan basketball scandal\n\nIn 2002, Webber was charged for lying to a grand jury as part of a larger investigation of a numbers gambling operation, run by Michigan basketball program booster Ed Martin, in Ford Motor Company plants in the Detroit area. The investigation, originally focused on the numbers operation and tax evasion, soon widened to include the University of Michigan basketball program. Martin was convicted on counts of tax evasion and robbery and was scheduled to testify on the financial connections between himself and Webber at a sentencing hearing, but died of a heart attack before the hearing.\n\n\nAs a result of evidence admitted during the course of Martin's trial, Webber pleaded guilty to one count of criminal contempt for lying about his role in a scandal in which four players, including himself, had accepted illicit loans from Martin. Martin had been giving money to Webber since the 8th grade. He admitted in the plea that in 1994 he gave Martin about $38,000 in cash as partial repayment for expenditures Martin made on his behalf.[11] He was ordered to pay $100,000 and perform 330 hours of community service.\n\n\nDue to concerns that Webber's amateur status had been compromised, Michigan forfeited its victory in the 1992 Final Four over Cincinnati, as well as its runner-up status in the 1992 tourney. Michigan also forfeited the entire 1992–93 season, removed the 1992 and 1993 Final Four banners from the Crisler Arena rafters, and deleted Webber's records from its record book. The NCAA also ordered Michigan to disassociate itself from Webber until 2013. Webber later called Michigan's decision \"hurtful\" because he and his Fab Five teammates \"gave everything to Michigan\" while they played there.\n\n\nAfter Webber's plea, the Michigan State High School Athletic Association (MHSAA) recommended that Detroit Country Day forfeit all games in which Webber appeared (including three state championships), since according to his own admission, Webber had been accepting money from Martin since junior high school. The school conducted its own investigation, and called a press conference to announce it had found \"no credible evidence\" that Webber had accepted \"substantial\" amounts of cash from Martin while in high school, and therefore refused to forfeit any games. The MHSAA claimed it had no legal authority to force the games to be forfeited.\n\n\nWebber was suspended by the NBA for a total of eight games—five for an unnamed violation of the league substance abuse policies and three for lying to the grand jury. Webber received the suspensions once he recovered from an injury that kept him out for half of the 2003–04 season.\n\n\nThe scandal was explored in a documentary by ESPN Films called *The Fab Five*, which aired in March 2011. In it, the University of Michigan repeated its position that it would not associate with Webber until he publicly apologized for his part in the Ed Martin scandal, with the self-imposed 10-year ban on its association with the remainder of the players ending in 2013. Webber declined to participate in the documentary.\n\n\nWebber made his first post-ban public appearance at the University of Michigan on November 3, 2018, when he was invited by football coach Jim Harbaugh to participate as an honorary captain for its game against Penn State; Webber was warmly received at Michigan Stadium. Of the experience, Webber said on NBA TV, \"Tell you what, fellas, this was a great moment, in front of 100,000 people. I had goosebumps and chills, and definitely some watery eyes.\"[12] Webber also spent time with the football program as its guest before the game. He did not meet with the Michigan basketball team or staff, but despite this, head coach John Beilein stated that \"I think it was a great step in the right direction that he was here.\"[13] After Juwan Howard, teammate of Webber from the Fab Five, took over as head coach in 2019, Webber indicated to TMZ that he is open to reconciling with Michigan basketball and said, \"Howard is my friend.... and therefore, I put pride aside\", but wants his return to the Crisler Arena to be private.[14]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (1993–1994)[edit]\n\n\nWebber was selected by the Orlando Magic with the first pick of the 1993 NBA draft, becoming the first sophomore since Magic Johnson to be a #1 overall draft pick.[8] The Magic immediately traded him to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Penny Hardaway and three future first round draft picks. Over his 15-year NBA career, Webber made $178 million.[15]\n\n\nWebber had an outstanding first year, averaging 17.5 points and 9.1 rebounds per game and winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He was instrumental in leading the Warriors back into the playoffs where they were swept by the Charles Barkley-led Phoenix Suns in three games. However, he had a long-standing conflict with his coach, Don Nelson.[16] Nelson wanted to make Webber primarily a post player, despite Webber's superb passing ability and good ball handling skills for someone his size at 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) tall. Webber also disliked playing a substantial amount of time at center, given Nelson's propensity towards smaller, faster line ups. In the 1994 off-season, the Warriors acquired Rony Seikaly so that Webber could play primarily at power forward. However, at the time, the differences between Webber and Nelson were considered to be irreconcilable. Webber exercised a one-year escape clause in his contract, stating he had no intention of returning to the Warriors. With few alternatives, Golden State agreed to a sign-and-trade deal, sending Webber to the Washington Bullets (renamed the Wizards in 1997) for forward Tom Gugliotta and three first-round draft picks. The three draft picks included two of the picks the Warriors had traded to the Magic to obtain Webber in the first place, as the Magic had included those picks in a trade package with the Bullets less than 4 months earlier.[17]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets / Wizards (1994–1998)[edit]\n\n\nWith the Washington Bullets, Webber was reunited with his college teammate and friend, Juwan Howard. He spent the next three years with the Bullets (later renamed the Washington Wizards), although in the 1995–96 season injuries limited him to only 15 games. Webber rebounded the following year and was named to his first All-Star team in 1997. The same season, Webber led the Bullets into the playoffs for the first time in nine years, but they were swept by the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in three games. By 1998, Webber had established himself as a great power forward, but his time in Washington had also worn out.\n\n\n\n### Sacramento Kings (1998–2005)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

In his first year with the Kings (the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season), Webber won the rebounding title averaging a league high 13.0 rebounds per game, ending Dennis Rodman's seven-year run as the NBA's rebound leader. Under the guidance of Rick Adelman, the Kings team made it into the 1999 Playoffs, where they lost to the Utah Jazz led by future hall of famers Karl Malone and John Stockton.\n\n\nIn years to come, Webber and the Kings became one of the league's top franchises, and NBA title contenders. He was named to the All-Star team again in 2000 and 2001 while cementing his status as one of the premier power forwards in the NBA. For the 1999–2000 season Webber was the cover athlete on *NBA Jam 2000*; that season, Webber led the Kings to 44 wins improving their win column from a year before, and into the first round of the 2000 Playoffs where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers. After losing the first two games of the series in Los Angeles, the Kings won the next two in Sacramento, including 23 points, 14 rebounds, 7 blocks, 8 assists and 4 steals from Webber in game four, to send the series back to Los Angeles for a deciding game 5. The Kings lost Game 5 and the series to the Lakers who went on to win the championship that year.\n\n\nWebber peaked in the 2000–01 season, when he averaged a career-high 27.1 points. He also averaged 11.1 rebounds and was fourth in MVP voting, while starting at forward for the Western Conference All-Star Team in the 2001 All-Star Game in Washington. In the 2001 Playoffs, Webber and the Kings defeated the Phoenix Suns in four games of the first round to advance to the second round (first time of his career he advanced past the first round), where they faced the Los Angeles Lakers for a second year in a row. The Kings lost in four games to the Lakers despite Webber's 21 points, 11 rebounds and 8 assists in game four.\n\n\nOn July 27, 2001, Webber signed a seven-year, $127 million contract with the Kings. In the 2001–02 season, Webber played in 54 games leading the Kings to a Pacific division title and a franchise-record (and league-best) 61–21 season. He also made his fourth All-Star team and the All-NBA Second Team. In the 2002 Playoffs the Kings defeated the Utah Jazz in four games and Dallas Mavericks in five games in the first two rounds en route to reaching the Western Conference Finals against their archrivals, the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, a series that would prove to be one of the most memorable (and most controversial) in NBA History. The series was nip and tuck all the way as both teams traded wins in the first six games of the series as the Lakers won games one, four (highlighted by the game winner from Robert Horry) and six (a game which featured many controversial calls, including a late-game foul on Mike Bibby after he was bleeding from being elbowed in the nose by Bryant. All told, the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter. Former NBA referee Tim Donaghy filed in court papers in 2008 said that Game 6 was fixed by the NBA. NBA Commissioner David Stern denied Donaghy's allegations. Lawrence Pedowitz, who led a review of the league's officiating following the outbreak of the scandal, concluded that while Game 6 was poorly officiated, no concrete evidence existed of it having been fixed.[19]), while the Kings won games two, three and five, including 29 points, 13 rebounds and 3 assists from Webber plus the game-winner from teammate Mike Bibby in game five, heading into the deciding seventh game back at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, a game which would prove to be most memorable of the series. The game was nip and tuck all the way with Webber recording 20 points, 11 assists, 8 rebounds, 2 blocks and 1 steal and Bryant and O'Neal recording 30 points, 10 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 steals, with 35 points, 13 rebounds, 4 blocks and 2 assists, respectively, as the game went into overtime with missed shots from teammates Stojakovic and Doug Christie, boiling to the last minutes of the game with Webber fouling O'Neal with 1:27 left in overtime causing O'Neal to make both free throws and the Kings would go on to lose Game 7 of the series at home. It was the closest that Webber ever got to a championship.\n\n\nIn the next season, Webber averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds per game. He was cited as a possible MVP candidate, and made his fifth consecutive All-Star team. In a bad sign of what was to come, Webber missed the All Star game with a sprained ankle. Nevertheless, he returned and the Kings were among the favorites to win the NBA Championship. In the second game of the 2003 Western Conference Semifinals against the Dallas Mavericks, Webber suffered a career-threatening knee injury while running down the lane untouched that forced him to miss nearly a year of action. This shattered the Kings' title hopes, and they lost the series in seven games.\n\n\nAfter microfracture surgery, he returned for the final 24 games of the 2003–04 season, in which he led the Kings (who went 55-27 that season) into the 2004 Playoffs where they faced their archrivals the Dallas Mavericks for the third year in a row, the Kings defeated the Mavericks in five thrilling entertaining games in the first round en route to reaching the Western Conference Semifinals against the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves led by league MVP Kevin Garnett, a series that would prove to be one of the most memorable in NBA history. Each game was neck and neck with both teams trading wins in the first six games of the series as the Timberwolves won games two, three and five, while the Kings won games one, four and six, including 28 points, 8 rebounds, 1 assist, 3 steals and 1 block from Webber in game four, heading into the deciding seventh game back at the Target Center in Minnesota, a game which would prove to be the most memorable of the series. The game was indecisively close throughout the first three quarters, with Webber recording 16 points, 8 rebounds, 4 assists and 1 steal, and Garnett on the other hand recording 32 points, 21 rebounds, 2 assists, 4 steals and 5 blocks. The game boiled down to the last play of the game with the Kings trailing the Timberwolves by 3 with 2.5 seconds left in the game. After receiving an inbounds pass Webber pump-faked Garnett in the air and got a clean look as Garnett avoided contact for a three-point shot that rimmed out as the final buzzer sounded and the Kings lost Game 7 and the series, marking the third year in a row that the Kings lost a deciding game 7. It turned out to be the last chance the Webber-led Kings had to win a championship and he was traded the following season thus resulting in the team being dismantled the following season.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (2005–2007)[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2005, Webber was traded, along with Michael Bradley and Matt Barnes, to the Philadelphia 76ers for power forward Kenny Thomas, forward/center Brian Skinner, and former King Corliss Williamson.[20] Webber took some time to fit in with the 76ers' system, which was geared toward star guard Allen Iverson.[21] While the Sixers reached the 2005 playoffs, they lost to the Detroit Pistons.[22] In the 21 games he played for Philadelphia in 2005, Webber averaged 15.6 points and 7.9 rebounds per game on 39.1% shooting.[15] Following the 2003 microfracture surgery on his knee, Webber had lost lateral quickness and was seen as a defensive liability.[23]\n\n\nIn 2006, Webber put up a resurgent 20 points and 9.9 rebounds per game in 75 games for Philadelphia.[24][15] Nevertheless, the team missed the playoffs,[25] finishing with a 38–44 record.[26] On Tuesday, April 18, 2006, Webber and Iverson were fined for not showing up at the Philadelphia 76ers' final home game of the season, which was Fan Appreciation Night, although both of them were injured and not expected to play.[27] The following day, they both apologized for being absent.[28]\n\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, Webber's role was reduced, and he was benched in the fourth quarter of multiple games. In November 2006, ESPN reported that \"Webber's minutes and production had \"dramatically declined\", and that coach Maurice Cheeks had \"turned him into a $20 million role player\". Webber discussed his frustration with team president Billy King, but claimed he was not requesting a trade.[24] During the 2006–07 season, Webber only played 18 of 35 games for the Sixers, leading the media[*who?*] to question his motivation. On January 11, 2007, King announced that the Sixers and Webber had agreed to a reported $25 million contract buyout on the remaining two years left on his contract, in effect paying him not to play. Later that day, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Detroit Pistons (2007)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2007, Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons.[29] He has stated throughout his career that he always wanted to play for his hometown team. His usual number 4 had been retired in honor of Joe Dumars, so Webber donned the number 84, because his nephew had a dream of him making a buzzer beater with that number on. The Pistons were a much improved basketball team after Webber's acquisition, improving their record in the Eastern Conference and solidifying the first seed in the East. However, the Eastern Conference favorites failed to advance to the finals after losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games in the \nEastern Conference Finals, leaving Webber short of an NBA Finals appearance yet again. Indeed, Webber performed well in the 2007 Playoffs despite receiving limited minutes. Webber still managed to average 10 points and 6 rebounds per game in the playoffs and shot an impressive 52.4% from the field. His efforts were highlighted by a game 5 performance in the Eastern Conference Finals in which Webber scored 20 points (including 5 points in the double-overtime period) on 9 of 13 shooting and grabbed 7 boards. Nevertheless, Detroit still lost what turned out to be the key game in the series in double overtime and Webber ended up averaging a career low 11.2 PPG in his run with the Pistons. During the off-season, Detroit did not re-sign Webber. Despite receiving lucrative proposals from teams in Europe, he was in free agency at the beginning of the regular season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Return to Golden State (2008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Webber (right) playing for the Warriors in 2008\nOn January 29, 2008, the Golden State Warriors signed Webber for the rest of the season.[30][31][32] Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the *San Francisco Chronicle* reported that he would receive the pro-rated veteran's minimum of $1.2 million[33] (approximately $570,000).[34] This came after a rejected offer by the Los Angeles Lakers who were trying to coax Webber in with two 10-day contracts so they could decide afterwards if they wanted him the rest of the season.[31] This also put to rest talks of joining the Detroit Pistons, Dallas Mavericks, or retirement.[35] He played in only nine games for the Warriors, averaging 3.9 points and 3.6 rebounds in 14 minutes per game.[15]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2008, Webber retired from basketball due to persistent problems with his surgically repaired knee and was waived by the Warriors.[36]\nOn March 27, 2008, Webber made his first appearance on television on Inside the *NBA on TNT*, alongside Charles Barkley and host Ernie Johnson. On April 25, 2008, TNT offered Webber a job to be a commentator for the postseason.\n\n\nOn February 6, 2009, Webber returned to ARCO Arena, home of the Sacramento Kings, to participate in the ceremonies surrounding the retirement of his jersey, #4.[37]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nWebber ranked #64 in *SLAM Magazine'*s Top 75 NBA players of all time in 2003 and ranked #11 in an ESPN.com experts poll of the top power forwards of all time in 2005.[38] He also ranked #72 on a list of the Top 96 NBA players of all time in Bill Simmons' 2009 bestseller *The Book of Basketball: The NBA According to the Sports Guy*.[39] In 2021, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Webber as the 65th greatest player in NBA history.[40]\n\n\nThe Sacramento Kings retired Webber's number 4 jersey on February 6, 2009, when the Kings hosted the Utah Jazz.[41]\n\n\nWebber was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2021.[42]\n\n\nWebber's youngest brother, David, matched his total with 3 Michigan High School Athletic Association state championships (1995–97),[43] and became Mid-American Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year.[44]\n\n\n\n## Post-basketball life[edit]\n\n\nSince retiring from the NBA, Webber became an analyst on NBA TV's *NBA Gametime Live*. He did the Tuesday Fan Night alongside Ernie Johnson and Kevin McHale. He also served as an occasional guest analyst (primary) on TNT's *Inside the NBA* from 2008 to 2021.[45][*circular reference*] During Charles Barkley's leave of absence, Webber substituted for him along with other guests such as Gary Payton and Mike Fratello. Since 2017, he was also a regular panelist during NBA on TNT's Monday coverage called *Players Only*, which features only former NBA players as studio analysts, play-by-play announcers, and color analysts for games.[46] In 2021, Webber parted ways with TNT on the eve of the NBA playoffs.[47][48] Webber has expressed interest in eventually becoming a GM and owner.[49]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Webber played in the NBA Asia Challenge 2010 at Araneta Coliseum in Metro Manila, an exhibition game which pitted NBA legends and NBA Development League players against Philippine Basketball Association stars and legends.[50]\n\n\nWebber was the owner of Center Court With C-Webb,[51] a restaurant in Sacramento, California. Opening in 2006,[52] the restaurant closed on November 17, 2009 [53] falling victim to the Great Recession.[54]\n\n\nEarlier that year, Webber married his longtime girlfriend Erika Dates during a private ceremony at his Atlanta home. In attendance were 200 guests including family and close friends.\n\n\nIn 2015, Chris Webber was the executive producer for the independent romantic-drama film *Somewhere in the Middle* by Lanre Olabisi. Webber has also tried his hand at music production, producing Nas's tracks \"Surviving the Times\" from his *Greatest Hits* album and \"Blunt Ashes\" from *Hip Hop Is Dead*.\n\n\nIn late 2016, Webber began hosting *Fearless or Insane* on Podcast One.[55] In 2018, with old age makeup, he played the role of Preacher in the film *Uncle Drew*, which starred Kyrie Irving.\n\n\nIn 2016, Webber began work as a professor of practice at Wake Forest University, teaching a class in sports storytelling.[56] In 2021 he began teaching at Morehouse College, instructing an online course on athlete activism.[57]\n\n\nIn 2021 Webber announced the launch of a private equity fund for investing in minority-owned cannabis businesses. He stated: \"It's crucial that we diversify leadership within the cannabis industry and level the playing field for people from our communities. For far too long, minorities have been excessively punished and incarcerated for cannabis while others profited.\"[58][59] In 2022 he announced the launch of \"Players Only\", a cannabis brand that will feature flower strains, cartridges, pre-rolls, vapes, sport recovery and performance products, apparel, and more.[60][61]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### African-American artifacts[edit]\n\n\nWebber has a personal collection of African-American artifacts which he began collecting in 1994. He began collecting them upon entering the NBA, starting with the purchase of two slave records. Webber believes that these artifacts are a reflection of his beliefs and aspirations. He initially collected them as encouragements to face life obstacles. However, he had no intentions on exhibiting them until the growth of his collection prompted additional storage. His collection includes an original 1901 publication of an autobiography by Booker T. Washington, and various documents, letters, and postcards signed by Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. When not on public exhibit, the artifacts are stored at the Sacramento Public Library's Archival Vault. In previous years, the Chris Webber Collection has been featured in Crocker Art Museum and Wayne State University.[62]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2007, Webber unveiled his collection of African-American artifacts during the Celebrating Heritage Exhibition at Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History in Detroit. During a news conference, Webber said he believed that children can learn from these artifacts, \"Hopefully, when children see them they will see there is no excuse for us not to be successful. There's no excuse not to find something that you love to do. There's no excuse to not work hard at it.\"[63]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nWebber is active in various charities and created The Timeout Foundation in 1993. The foundation's mission is to provide positive educational and recreational opportunities to youth.\n\n\nIn 1999, Webber created C-Webb's Crew where a group of tickets at every Kings regular home season game would be donated to at-risk youth and their families. To date, over 3,000 youths and their families have attended a game through C-Webb's Crew.\n\n\nCommunity awards Webber has won include the inaugural Sacramento Kings/Oscar Robertson Triple Double Award, which is annually awarded to a Kings player who exemplifies: team leadership, all-around game, and sportsmanship; the NBA Community Assist Award for his contributions in February 2003, and the Wish Maker of the Year in 2003 awarded by the Sacramento Chapter of the Make a Wish Foundation.\n\n\nWebber held a celebrity weekend, Bada Bling!, at the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. The event was held from July 28–30, 2006, and included a live auction and celebrity poker tournament. Many renowned NBA players participated including then-current and former teammates: Mike Bibby, Brad Miller, Andre Iguodala, Bobby Jackson, Kyle Korver, and his then-current coach, Maurice Cheeks. Other notable participants included Charles Barkley, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Gary Payton, Kenny Smith, Moses Malone, and Stephon Marbury. Numerous entertainers attended as well such as Nas and Common. All of the proceeds were donated to The Timeout Foundation.\n\n\nWebber hosted his 2nd annual Bada Bling charity weekend from July 20–22, 2007, at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.[64]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Webber was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of marijuana and five other traffic-related violations after being pulled over for speeding on the way to the practice center at the MCI Center in downtown Washington, D.C. Webber was eventually acquitted by a jury of the assault, resisting arrest, possession of marijuana and driving under the influence charges, and paid $560 in fines for lesser violations.[65]\n\n\nLater in 1998 during the off-season, while leaving Puerto Rico on a promotional tour for Fila sneakers, Webber paid a $500 fine after U.S. Customs found marijuana in his bag. Soon after Fila dropped Webber as an endorser, a three-member panel of arbitrators awarded Webber $2.61 million for breach of contract.\n\n\nAfter the closing of his first restaurant, property owner Promenade filed a $3 million lawsuit in 2010. The claims were for violating terms of a 20-year lease signed in 2005. Promenade was seeking funds to help re-lease the property and overdue rent.[54]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nWebber also has produced hip hop records, including two songs for rapper Nas: \"Blunt Ashes\" and \"Surviving the Times\" and appeared on the skit Webber from Naughty by Nature's Grammy Award-winning album Poverty's Paradise.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Album information\n |\n| --- |\n| ***2 Much

Nicknamed **KG** by his initials, and the \"**Big Ticket**\" for his emphatic dunking and athleticism, Garnett is considered one of the greatest power forwards of all time, being known for his intensity, defensive ability, and versatility.[1] As of 2020, he is one of five NBA players to have won both the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[n 1]\n\n\nIn high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award.[3][4] He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. \nGarnett made an immediate impact with the Minnesota Timberwolves, leading them to eight consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, he led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals and won the NBA MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2007–08.\n\n\nIn 2007, after 12 seasons with the Timberwolves, Garnett joined the Boston Celtics in a blockbuster trade. In his first year with the Celtics, he helped lead them to the 2008 NBA Finals, beating the Los Angeles Lakers, while also finishing in third place for the MVP award.[5] In 2013, Garnett was included in a second headline trade that sent him to the Brooklyn Nets with longtime Celtic Paul Pierce. In 2015, Garnett was traded back to Minnesota. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in September 2016. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.\n\n\nDuring his NBA career, Garnett was named to 15 All-Star Games, winning the All-Star MVP award in 2003.[n 2] He was named to the All-NBA Team nine times and to the NBA All-Defensive Team 12 times.[6] Garnett also holds several Timberwolves franchise records.\n\n\nGarnett made his feature film debut, playing a fictionalized version of himself, in the 2019 film *Uncut Gems*.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and high school career[edit]\n\n\nGarnett was born on May 19, 1976, in Greenville, South Carolina,[9] to Shirley Garnett. He was the second of his mother's three children.[10] Garnett's mother never married his father, O'Lewis McCullough, with their relationship ending shortly after his birth. Garnett grew up with his mother and stepfather, Ernest Irby, with whom he did not get along, and two sisters.[11]\n\n\nGarnett fell in love with the sport of basketball while attending Hillcrest Middle School, although he did not play organized basketball until high school. In his first three years of high school, Garnett attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, South Carolina, and played on the school's basketball team. However, during the summer before his senior year of high school, Garnett was in the general vicinity of a fight between black and white students. Although not directly involved, Garnett was one of three students arrested for second-degree lynching, a charge that was expunged through a pre-trial intervention.[12] Due to the racially charged incident and fearful of being a target, Garnett decided to leave Mauldin High[13] and transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago's West Side, for his senior year of high school.\n\n\nLiving with his sister in Chicago, Garnett led Farragut to a 28–2 record and was named National High School Player of the Year by *USA Today*. He was also named Mr. Basketball for the state of Illinois after averaging 25.2 points, 17.9 rebounds, 6.7 assists and 6.5 blocks while shooting 66.8% from the field. In four years of high school, Garnett posted an impressive 2,553 points, 1,809 rebounds and 737 blocked shots. In high school, Garnett played alongside Ronnie Fields, who also became a professional basketball player. Garnett was named the Most Outstanding Player at the McDonald's All-American Game after registering 18 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 blocked shots, and then declared himself eligible for the 1995 NBA draft.[14] To mark the 35th anniversary of the McDonald's All-American High School Boys Basketball Game, Garnett was honored as one of 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[4] Garnett's decision not to play college basketball was influenced in part by his failure to score well enough on the ACT to meet NCAA requirements for freshman eligibility.[15] Garnett told *Student Sports Magazine* in 1995 that if he went to college, he would have played college basketball for the University of Maryland, a moderate surprise at the time considering, while Maryland and North Carolina[16] were contenders, the University of Michigan were viewed as front-runners in Garnett's recruitment.[17] However, in the years since his recruitment, several figures close to the recruitment, including former Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro, as well as Garnett himself, have stated that he would have likely attended Michigan, influenced an appreciation of the Fab Five and Chris Webber, in particular.[18][19][20]\n\n\nA Chicago area high school coach referred Garnett to Eric Fleisher, then agent for 18 NBA players and son of first National Basketball Players Association head Larry Fleisher, to discuss the possibility of going to the NBA straight out of high school. Two weeks later at the Lakeshore Athletic Club, Fleisher ran a small tryout where Garnett dominated against older, more experienced competition. Fleisher then set Detroit Pistons assistant John Hammond to run the drills at another workout at the University of Illinois-Chicago to gauge NBA interest. Representatives from the 13 teams with lottery picks, with Kevin McHale, Elgin Baylor, Flip Saunders, and Kevin Loughery among them, were in the workout that was scheduled around the same time as a pre-draft tryout camp. The workout included Garnett touching the box painted on the backboard above the rim multiple times, and McHale giving Garnett tips on shooting jump shots. An hour before going to the 1995 NBA draft in the Toronto SkyDome, his coach at Farragut, William (Wolf) Nelson, gave encouragement and told Garnett that he passed the last SAT test he took with a score of 970.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minnesota Timberwolves (1995–2007)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years (1995–1997)[edit]\n\n\nGarnett was drafted with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and became the first player to be drafted directly out of high school since 1975.[23] Since joining the NBA for the 1989–90 season, the Timberwolves had not won more than 29 games in any season.[24] In Garnett's rookie season, the Timberwolves were in the midst of a transition phase; they replaced Bill Blair with Flip Saunders as head coach early in the season, and made several trades. Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the starting lineup soon after Saunders became head coach and with the urging of Sam Mitchell. In the final 42 games of the year, averaged 14 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.26 blocks as a starter.[21] In his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer Tom Gugliotta carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later prep-to-pro prospects such as Amar'e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard would, but he did have a very respectable rookie year. He was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team on averages of 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game.[6] Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.[14]\n\n\nBefore the 1996–97 season, the Timberwolves made a draft-day trade for point guard Stephon Marbury of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. During the season, Garnett posted improved averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals.[6] He also had two games where he registered eight blocks.[14] With a 40–42 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All-Star appearances, and Marbury established himself as a valuable young lead guard. However, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, and Charles Barkley, proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3–0 in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### Franchise player (1997–2001)[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1997, Garnett and Fleisher turned down the Timberwolves' offer of a contract worth $102 million over six years. They thought there would be more offered to them on the basis of the signings of $105 million over seven years for Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and $100.8 million over seven years for Juwan Howard with the Washington Bullets. To get out of the spotlight while negotiations were ongoing, Garnett stayed in Fleisher's Westchester County home, north of New York City. One hour before the deadline on 1 October 1997,[21] the Timberwolves and Garnett agreed on a six-year contract extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million.[14] The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would make it impossible for the Wolves to sign new players or even keep their own. The enormous size of Garnett's contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the 1998–99 NBA season. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45–37 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3–2 to the Seattle SuperSonics and superstar point guard Gary Payton. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves' first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer Tom Gugliotta left for the Phoenix Suns.\n\n\n\n![](image)Garnett as a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves (2007)\nIn the lockout-shortened season that followed, Garnett broke through as a superstar. Putting up stats of 20.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.8 blocks per game,[6] he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. However, midway through the season, Stephon Marbury was traded to the New Jersey Nets. Although the Wolves received two-time All-Star Terrell Brandon in return, they were not able to overcome the discord and limped into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 25–25 record. The Wolves were defeated in the first round again, this time losing 3–1 to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs who were led by young superstar and eventual NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan. In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Garnett continued his notable play, averaging 22.9 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.6 blocks, and 1.5 steals per game. Garnett also made the first of his four All-NBA First Team appearances and came in second place in the MVP voting.[6] Assisted by sharpshooting rookie forward Wally Szczerbiak and steady veteran Terrell Brandon, the Wolves posted a franchise-best 50–32 record, but succumbed in the first round to the Portland Trail Blazers 3–1.\n\n\nOn May 20, 2000, Timberwolves' guard and Garnett's close friend Malik Sealy was killed by a drunk driver shortly after celebrating Garnett's 24th birthday.[25] Later that year, the NBA ruled that the free-agent signing of Joe Smith was illegal. The league punished the team for the illegal signing by stripping them of three first-round draft picks, fining Glen Taylor (the owner of the team) $3.5 million, and banning general manager Kevin McHale for one year. In the 2000–01 NBA season, Garnett led the Wolves to a 47–35 record and made the All-NBA Second Team, but again, the Wolves did not survive the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Spurs 3–1.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and division champions (2001–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Garnett posted another notable season, his averages of 21.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game enough for another All-NBA Second Team nomination. However, the Timberwolves bowed out in the first round for the sixth consecutive time, this time getting swept 3–0 by the Dallas Mavericks led by Michael Finley, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki. Garnett's next season was one of the best of his career, his 23.0 ppg / 13.4 rpg / 6.0 apg / 1.6 bpg / 1.4 spg season earning him his second All-NBA First Team nomination and second place in the MVP voting.[14] The Timberwolves posted a good 51–31 record, but for the seventh consecutive time, they did not make it out of the first round, this time losing to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2.\n\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, things finally seemed to come together for Garnett. In past years, the Wolves had practically been a one-man show, but now, the Timberwolves had made two valuable acquisitions: highly talented but volatile swingman Latrell Sprewell and the seasoned two-time NBA champion Sam Cassell, who supplanted Troy Hudson at point guard. In addition, defensive center Ervin Johnson complemented the inconsistent Michael Olowokandi. Powered by the best supporting cast up to this point in his career, Garnett averaged 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals per game for the season. Having recorded career-highs in points, rebounds, blocks and leading the league rebounds, Garnett was named the league Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career.[6] With a franchise-record 58 wins, the Wolves stormed into the playoffs, and finally conquered their playoff bane by defeating the Denver Nuggets 4–1 in the first round. After disposing of the strong Sacramento Kings 4–3 in the Western Conference semi-finals, Garnett and the Timberwolves met the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. There, playmaker Cassell went down with a back injury. With reserve point guard Hudson also injured, the Timberwolves alternated between third playmaker Darrick Martin and shooting guard Fred Hoiberg at the \"one\", or even running Garnett himself as point forward or a real point guard. The Los Angeles Lakers pulled off a 4–2 victory in the series.\n\n\n\n#### Frustration (2004–2007)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2005, Garnett scored a career high 47 points to go along with 17 rebounds in a 115–122 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[26] He was also named to the All-NBA Second Team,[6] but the Timberwolves failed to make the playoffs for the first time in eight years with a record of 44–38. The 2005–06 season brought more frustration for Garnett. Sprewell turned down a three-year, $21 million extension, and the Wolves wary of his injuries and age, traded Cassell for the much less effective Marko Jarić, and the team's record for 2005–06 fell to 33–49. Despite Garnett's play, the team logged the second-worst record since Garnett joined the franchise. The Timberwolves' record dropped further in 2006–07, going 32–50 that season. In both of those seasons, Garnett earned All-NBA Third Team honors.\n\n\nDuring the 2007 off-season, Glen Taylor admitted that although he planned on retaining Garnett, he finally listened to trade offers.[27] Garnett's name was mentioned in various trade rumors involving the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, and Dallas Mavericks.[28][29][30][31] Garnett later confirmed that his preferred trade destinations were the Lakers, Celtics, and Suns.[32] He had initially contacted Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant about joining the team as the Lakers were his initial top choice but Bryant didn't answer or return the calls. Garnett stated, \"I'm just being honest with everybody. I wanted to link with Kobe. Kobe and I had a different connect. When Kobe-Shaq went on their little thing, a lot of people went with Shaq. A lot of people didn't even fuck with Kobe. You know, Kobe, whatever. One of the very few to just stay with him. I was a neutral guy, anyway. I show everybody love. I tried to link with him, and I couldn't get him on the line.\"[32] The Lakers originally had a trade framework in place that involved Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum.[32]\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2007–2013)[edit]\n\n\n#### NBA championship, DPOY award and injury (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garnett in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks.\n![](image)Garnett dunking a ball in a game against the Washington Wizards.\nOn July 31, 2007, Garnett was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Theo Ratliff, cash considerations, Boston's 2009 first-round draft pick (top 3 protected), and the 2009 first-round pick which Minnesota traded to Boston in the Ricky Davis–Wally Szczerbiak trade of 2006.[33] The 7-for-1 deal constitutes the largest number of players traded for a single player in league history.[34] At the time of the trade, Garnett had the longest current tenure of any player in the NBA with one team, having played for the Timberwolves for his first 12 seasons (a total of 927 games). Garnett said that he was proud to be a part of the Celtics and hoped to continue its proud tradition and basketball success.[35][36][37] On the day the trade was announced, Garnett signed a three-year, $60 million contract extension that would start after his prior deal ran out in 2009. On August 1, the day after signing with the Celtics, Garnett threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park prior to a Red Sox–Orioles game.[38]\n\n\nThe trade for Garnett had many experts speculating that the Celtics would have a resurgence during the 2007–08 season.[39] The combination of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Garnett were almost automatically nicknamed \"The Big Three\" by the media, after the Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish trio.[40] Garnett wore jersey number 5 for the Celtics since his number with the Timberwolves, number 21, was retired by the Celtics, previously worn by Bill Sharman. He made his Boston debut with a strong performance against the Washington Wizards, with 22 points and 20 rebounds.[41] He also led all players in voting for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. Garnett received 2,399,148 votes, the sixth highest total in NBA All-Star balloting history.[42] However, Garnett was unable to play due to an abdominal strain, and Detroit Pistons forward Rasheed Wallace was named to replace him.[43][44][45] Garnett passed 20,000 points for his career, becoming the 32nd player in NBA history to reach the mark,[46] with a layup in the second quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies on March 8.[47] On April 22, Garnett was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year for the 2007–08 season.[48][49] It was the only major award a Celtic player had not claimed since the franchise's foundation in 1946.[50] Garnett said it was a team effort which helped him win the award.[51] Garnett was also third in MVP voting for the year, behind only Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul.[52] Garnett helped the Celtics to their 17th NBA Championship, with 26 points and 14 rebounds in Game 6 of the NBA Finals. During that championship season, Garnett and Celtics legend Bill Russell developed a relationship, which Garnett credited as a major influence in helping him succeed during his first season as a Celtic.[53] On June 18, 2008, Garnett and Ray Allen appeared on the *Late Show with David Letterman*, soon after winning the championship.[54]\n\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, Garnett started all of the 57 games he was able to suit up for. He averaged 15.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists. On October 31, 2008, Garnett became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 1,000 career games, at 32 years and 165 days.[55][56] Garnett earned his twelfth consecutive All-Star Game start on February 15, 2009. Following the All-Star Game, during a game against the Utah Jazz, Garnett injured his right knee late in the second quarter. The injury occurred on February 19, 2009 while attempting to go up for an alley-oop.[57] He was forced to miss the next 14 games. Upon his return, he averaged nine points and 4.5 rebounds in four games before being shut down for the season, missing the final 25 games of the regular season as well as the 2009 playoffs due to his injured knee.[58] In May 2009, he underwent knee surgery.[59] Without Garnett, the Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, but were eliminated by the Orlando Magic.\n\n\n\n#### Final All-Star appearances and falling short (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Garnett and the Celtics, joined by newly signed free agent Rasheed Wallace, struggled with injuries and inconsistency throughout much of the regular season and earned the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Garnett was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game (his 13th All-Star Game selection). Despite being written off by nearly every major sports analyst, the Celtics elevated their play and consistency, and dominated opponents much as they did during their 2008 championship run. They eliminated the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Orlando Magic to advance to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals. In Game 6 against the Cavaliers, Garnett recorded 22 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists in the series-clinching win.[60] The 2010 Finals went to a decisive seventh game in Los Angeles, where the Celtics led well into the third quarter before the Lakers mounted a comeback and held on for the victory.[61]\n\n\nIn the 2010–11 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started strong, winning 23 of their first 26 games. On December 30, 2010, Garnett injured his right knee after he tried to dunk. He missed two weeks with the injury. Garnett returned on January 17, 2011 to face the Orlando Magic.[62] The Celtics ended the regular season third in the Eastern Conference behind the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat.[63] Garnett averaged under 15 points, under 9 rebounds, and a career low 0.8 blocks per game. After sweeping the New York Knicks in the first round, they faced the Heat in the semi-finals. After losing the first two games of the series, Garnett's playoff high 28 points helped the Celtics take Game 3. However, the Heat won the next two games, winning the series 4–1.[64]\n\n\nIn the lockout shortened 2011–12 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started off slowly, being below .500 with a 15–17 record by the All-Star break. Garnett was not selected for the All-Star game for the first time in 11 years. After, however, Boston quickly became one of the best teams in the league, finishing the second half of the season with a 24–10 record, entering the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 39–27 record. Boston made a deep run in the playoffs, going all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. They faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, defeating them in six games. Boston then defeated the Philadelphia 76ers after a challenging seven-game series. Boston made the Eastern Conference Finals for the third time in five years, and faced another superstar trio in Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James of the Miami Heat. The Celtics lost the first two games, but came back strong to win the next three games. However, the Heat were too strong in Games 6 and 7, defeating the Celtics 4–3. Garnett found a resurgence in the playoffs, averaging 19.2 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.\n\n\nOn June 30, 2012, Garnett agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Celtics worth an estimated $34 million.[65][66] On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Garnett was voted to start in the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston.[67] On February 7, 2013, Garnett recorded his 25,000th point in a 116–95 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.[68][69]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2021, the Celtics announced that they would retire Garnett's number 5 jersey on March 13, 2022, in a game against the Dallas Mavericks.[70]\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets (2013–2015)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks, and Keith Bogans. Two of the Celtics' picks eventually became future All-Stars Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.[71] The deal was finally completed on July 12 with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White.[72] Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy.[73][74]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103–99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons.[75] The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion.[76] Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.[77]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102–90 win over the Detroit Pistons.[78] Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110–99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.[79]\n\n\n\n### Return to Minnesota (2015–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garnett's first game back with the Timberwolves in 2015.\nOn February 19, 2015, Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause in order to be traded back to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young.[80] Six days later, he made his return for the Timberwolves against the Washington Wizards at the Target Center, recording five points on two-of-seven shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in 19 minutes in his first game for Minnesota since 2007.[81] He appeared in just five games for the Timberwolves in 2014–15, before sitting out the team's final 21 games of the season due to a nagging knee injury.[82]\n\n\nOn July 11, 2015, Garnett re-signed with the Timberwolves to a two-year deal.[83][84] On November 15, 2015, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Garnett became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 50,000 minutes, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Jason Kidd, and Elvin Hayes.[85] On December 1, against the Orlando Magic, Garnett surpassed Kidd (50,110) for third on the NBA's career minutes list.[86] Four days later, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the 15th player in NBA history to surpass 26,000 career points.[87] On December 11, Garnett passed Malone as the NBA's all-time leader in defensive rebounds during Minnesota's 111–108 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with four defensive boards to give him 11,409 for his career, three ahead of Malone.[88] Garnett appeared in 38 of the team's first 45 games of the season before missing the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury, the same knee that kept him out of 25 games in 2008–09 when he was playing for Boston, as well as much of his post-trade time in Minnesota during the 2014–15 season.[89]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2016, Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA.[90][91] While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team make it to the playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team's owner that he was not sure that his knees would hold up for one more season.[92]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2000 Summer Olympics, Garnett won a gold medal as a member of the United States national team. In his first and only FIBA tournament, Garnett averaged 10.8 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game.[93]\n\n\n\n## Post-playing career[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Garnett joined the crew on TNT's *Inside the NBA*.[94] The following month, he became the host of his own segment *Area 21*.[95] In January 2017, Garnett joined the Los Angeles Clippers as a consultant.[96] He also consulted with the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2016–17 season.[97]\n\n\n\n### *Uncut Gems*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Uncut Gems\n\n> \n> \"You realize how hard he worked in acting—he must've worked three times as hard on the court\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—*Uncut Gems* producer Sebastian Bear-McClard on Garnett[98]\n\nGarnett plays a fictionalized version of himself in the 2019 crime thriller *Uncut Gems*, directed by the Safdie brothers.[99] The movie is set in 2012 and revolves around the Eastern Conference Semi-finals series between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. While playing in Philadelphia, Garnett makes a trip to a New York City jewelry store owned by Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) in the Diamond District. Garnett takes a liking to an Ethiopian opal which Ratner shows off. The story revolves around Garnett's performance in the series and relationship with the Opal, alongside Ratner's chaotic and intense personal life.\n\n\nGarnett's performance received positive reviews from critics.[100][101] The Safdie brothers picked Garnett after a series of rewrites based on available players. Prior to securing Garnett, the duo approached Amar'e Stoudemire, who refused to cut his hair to match the period;[101] and Kobe Bryant, whose representation said he wanted to direct and not act, though Bryant said he wasn't contacted;[102][101] and Joel Embiid, whose active NBA schedule could not accommodate filming.[101] Garnett was among the first non-active athletes they approached. Garnett said the process of filming \"felt special, but you didn't know it.\"[103]\n\n\nHe then subsequently signed a deal with Village Roadshow Pictures.[104]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGarnett wore clothing branded as \"OBF\", standing for Official Block Family. The name came from what he called his close group of friends from Beechwood Court in Mauldin, South Carolina. He brought OBF members to live with him in his Minnesota home, and let some on board some team's charter flights during road trips.[105][22][106] He met Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the Grammy-winning record producers for Janet Jackson and Boyz II Men, early in his career in Minnesota and considers them as mentors.[21]\n\n\nIn July 2004, Garnett married his longtime girlfriend Brandi Padilla during a private ceremony in California. Due to the wedding, Garnett did not take part in the Athens Olympic Games.[107] The couple has two daughters. On July 12, 2018, Garnett's wife filed for divorce, asking for custody of the children.[108][109] Garnett is the half-brother of former basketball player Louis McCullough. Another professional basketball player, former Los Angeles Laker Shammond Williams, is his cousin.[110]\n\n\nHis nicknames include \"The Big Ticket\", \"KG\", \"The Kid\", and formerly \"The Franchise\" (after being known as the Minnesota Timberwolves' franchise player).[14] He mentally prepared himself before games by banging his head against a padded basketball stanchion.[111] Although Garnett is officially listed as 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) by the NBA, he is widely accepted to be at least 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) tall.[112][113] During the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, Garnett admitted in an interview with Craig Sager to be \"6 ft 11 in and some quarters\" tall.[114] Measurements from the 1995 NBA draft indicated that Garnett, who was 19 years old at the time, was 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) tall barefoot.[115] In 1997, Garnett was measured by the Minnesota Timberwolves training staff to be 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall in his basketball shoes.[116] In December 2011, Garnett agreed to become a limited shareholder of American-owned Italian Serie A football team A.S. Roma.[117]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Simon & Schuster published Garnett's autobiography *KG: A to Z: An Uncensored Encyclopedia of Life, Basketball, and Everything in Between*, written with David Ritz. In part of the work, Garnett describes his successive involvement with various sneaker manufacturers.[118]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n |

Nicknamed **KG** by his initials, and the \"**Big Ticket**\" for his emphatic dunking and athleticism, Garnett is considered one of the greatest power forwards of all time, being known for his intensity, defensive ability, and versatility.[1] As of 2020, he is one of five NBA players to have won both the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[n 1]\n\n\nIn high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award.[3][4] He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. \nGarnett made an immediate impact with the Minnesota Timberwolves, leading them to eight consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, he led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals and won the NBA MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year in 2007–08.\n\n\nIn 2007, after 12 seasons with the Timberwolves, Garnett joined the Boston Celtics in a blockbuster trade. In his first year with the Celtics, he helped lead them to the 2008 NBA Finals, beating the Los Angeles Lakers, while also finishing in third place for the MVP award.[5] In 2013, Garnett was included in a second headline trade that sent him to the Brooklyn Nets with longtime Celtic Paul Pierce. In 2015, Garnett was traded back to Minnesota. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in September 2016. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.\n\n\nDuring his NBA career, Garnett was named to 15 All-Star Games, winning the All-Star MVP award in 2003.[n 2] He was named to the All-NBA Team nine times and to the NBA All-Defensive Team 12 times.[6] Garnett also holds several Timberwolves franchise records.\n\n\nGarnett made his feature film debut, playing a fictionalized version of himself, in the 2019 film *Uncut Gems*.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and high school career[edit]\n\n\nGarnett was born on May 19, 1976, in Greenville, South Carolina,[9] to Shirley Garnett. He was the second of his mother's three children.[10] Garnett's mother never married his father, O'Lewis McCullough, with their relationship ending shortly after his birth. Garnett grew up with his mother and stepfather, Ernest Irby, with whom he did not get along, and two sisters.[11]\n\n\nGarnett fell in love with the sport of basketball while attending Hillcrest Middle School, although he did not play organized basketball until high school. In his first three years of high school, Garnett attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, South Carolina, and played on the school's basketball team. However, during the summer before his senior year of high school, Garnett was in the general vicinity of a fight between black and white students. Although not directly involved, Garnett was one of three students arrested for second-degree lynching, a charge that was expunged through a pre-trial intervention.[12] Due to the racially charged incident and fearful of being a target, Garnett decided to leave Mauldin High[13] and transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago's West Side, for his senior year of high school.\n\n\nLiving with his sister in Chicago, Garnett led Farragut to a 28–2 record and was named National High School Player of the Year by *USA Today*. He was also named Mr. Basketball for the state of Illinois after averaging 25.2 points, 17.9 rebounds, 6.7 assists and 6.5 blocks while shooting 66.8% from the field. In four years of high school, Garnett posted an impressive 2,553 points, 1,809 rebounds and 737 blocked shots. In high school, Garnett played alongside Ronnie Fields, who also became a professional basketball player. Garnett was named the Most Outstanding Player at the McDonald's All-American Game after registering 18 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 blocked shots, and then declared himself eligible for the 1995 NBA draft.[14] To mark the 35th anniversary of the McDonald's All-American High School Boys Basketball Game, Garnett was honored as one of 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[4] Garnett's decision not to play college basketball was influenced in part by his failure to score well enough on the ACT to meet NCAA requirements for freshman eligibility.[15] Garnett told *Student Sports Magazine* in 1995 that if he went to college, he would have played college basketball for the University of Maryland, a moderate surprise at the time considering, while Maryland and North Carolina[16] were contenders, the University of Michigan were viewed as front-runners in Garnett's recruitment.[17] However, in the years since his recruitment, several figures close to the recruitment, including former Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro, as well as Garnett himself, have stated that he would have likely attended Michigan, influenced an appreciation of the Fab Five and Chris Webber, in particular.[18][19][20]\n\n\nA Chicago area high school coach referred Garnett to Eric Fleisher, then agent for 18 NBA players and son of first National Basketball Players Association head Larry Fleisher, to discuss the possibility of going to the NBA straight out of high school. Two weeks later at the Lakeshore Athletic Club, Fleisher ran a small tryout where Garnett dominated against older, more experienced competition. Fleisher then set Detroit Pistons assistant John Hammond to run the drills at another workout at the University of Illinois-Chicago to gauge NBA interest. Representatives from the 13 teams with lottery picks, with Kevin McHale, Elgin Baylor, Flip Saunders, and Kevin Loughery among them, were in the workout that was scheduled around the same time as a pre-draft tryout camp. The workout included Garnett touching the box painted on the backboard above the rim multiple times, and McHale giving Garnett tips on shooting jump shots. An hour before going to the 1995 NBA draft in the Toronto SkyDome, his coach at Farragut, William (Wolf) Nelson, gave encouragement and told Garnett that he passed the last SAT test he took with a score of 970.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Minnesota Timberwolves (1995–2007)[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years (1995–1997)[edit]\n\n\nGarnett was drafted with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and became the first player to be drafted directly out of high school since 1975.[23] Since joining the NBA for the 1989–90 season, the Timberwolves had not won more than 29 games in any season.[24] In Garnett's rookie season, the Timberwolves were in the midst of a transition phase; they replaced Bill Blair with Flip Saunders as head coach early in the season, and made several trades. Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the starting lineup soon after Saunders became head coach and with the urging of Sam Mitchell. In the final 42 games of the year, averaged 14 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.26 blocks as a starter.[21] In his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer Tom Gugliotta carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later prep-to-pro prospects such as Amar'e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard would, but he did have a very respectable rookie year. He was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team on averages of 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game.[6] Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.[14]\n\n\nBefore the 1996–97 season, the Timberwolves made a draft-day trade for point guard Stephon Marbury of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. During the season, Garnett posted improved averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals.[6] He also had two games where he registered eight blocks.[14] With a 40–42 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All-Star appearances, and Marbury established himself as a valuable young lead guard. However, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, and Charles Barkley, proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3–0 in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### Franchise player (1997–2001)[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1997, Garnett and Fleisher turned down the Timberwolves' offer of a contract worth $102 million over six years. They thought there would be more offered to them on the basis of the signings of $105 million over seven years for Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and $100.8 million over seven years for Juwan Howard with the Washington Bullets. To get out of the spotlight while negotiations were ongoing, Garnett stayed in Fleisher's Westchester County home, north of New York City. One hour before the deadline on 1 October 1997,[21] the Timberwolves and Garnett agreed on a six-year contract extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million.[14] The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would make it impossible for the Wolves to sign new players or even keep their own. The enormous size of Garnett's contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the 1998–99 NBA season. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45–37 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3–2 to the Seattle SuperSonics and superstar point guard Gary Payton. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves' first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer Tom Gugliotta left for the Phoenix Suns.\n\n\n\n![](image)Garnett as a member of the Minnesota Timberwolves (2007)\nIn the lockout-shortened season that followed, Garnett broke through as a superstar. Putting up stats of 20.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.8 blocks per game,[6] he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. However, midway through the season, Stephon Marbury was traded to the New Jersey Nets. Although the Wolves received two-time All-Star Terrell Brandon in return, they were not able to overcome the discord and limped into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 25–25 record. The Wolves were defeated in the first round again, this time losing 3–1 to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs who were led by young superstar and eventual NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan. In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Garnett continued his notable play, averaging 22.9 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.6 blocks, and 1.5 steals per game. Garnett also made the first of his four All-NBA First Team appearances and came in second place in the MVP voting.[6] Assisted by sharpshooting rookie forward Wally Szczerbiak and steady veteran Terrell Brandon, the Wolves posted a franchise-best 50–32 record, but succumbed in the first round to the Portland Trail Blazers 3–1.\n\n\nOn May 20, 2000, Timberwolves' guard and Garnett's close friend Malik Sealy was killed by a drunk driver shortly after celebrating Garnett's 24th birthday.[25] Later that year, the NBA ruled that the free-agent signing of Joe Smith was illegal. The league punished the team for the illegal signing by stripping them of three first-round draft picks, fining Glen Taylor (the owner of the team) $3.5 million, and banning general manager Kevin McHale for one year. In the 2000–01 NBA season, Garnett led the Wolves to a 47–35 record and made the All-NBA Second Team, but again, the Wolves did not survive the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Spurs 3–1.\n\n\n\n#### MVP and division champions (2001–2004)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2001–02 season, Garnett posted another notable season, his averages of 21.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game enough for another All-NBA Second Team nomination. However, the Timberwolves bowed out in the first round for the sixth consecutive time, this time getting swept 3–0 by the Dallas Mavericks led by Michael Finley, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki. Garnett's next season was one of the best of his career, his 23.0 ppg / 13.4 rpg / 6.0 apg / 1.6 bpg / 1.4 spg season earning him his second All-NBA First Team nomination and second place in the MVP voting.[14] The Timberwolves posted a good 51–31 record, but for the seventh consecutive time, they did not make it out of the first round, this time losing to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2.\n\n\nIn the 2003–04 season, things finally seemed to come together for Garnett. In past years, the Wolves had practically been a one-man show, but now, the Timberwolves had made two valuable acquisitions: highly talented but volatile swingman Latrell Sprewell and the seasoned two-time NBA champion Sam Cassell, who supplanted Troy Hudson at point guard. In addition, defensive center Ervin Johnson complemented the inconsistent Michael Olowokandi. Powered by the best supporting cast up to this point in his career, Garnett averaged 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals per game for the season. Having recorded career-highs in points, rebounds, blocks and leading the league rebounds, Garnett was named the league Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career.[6] With a franchise-record 58 wins, the Wolves stormed into the playoffs, and finally conquered their playoff bane by defeating the Denver Nuggets 4–1 in the first round. After disposing of the strong Sacramento Kings 4–3 in the Western Conference semi-finals, Garnett and the Timberwolves met the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. There, playmaker Cassell went down with a back injury. With reserve point guard Hudson also injured, the Timberwolves alternated between third playmaker Darrick Martin and shooting guard Fred Hoiberg at the \"one\", or even running Garnett himself as point forward or a real point guard. The Los Angeles Lakers pulled off a 4–2 victory in the series.\n\n\n\n#### Frustration (2004–2007)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2005, Garnett scored a career high 47 points to go along with 17 rebounds in a 115–122 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[26] He was also named to the All-NBA Second Team,[6] but the Timberwolves failed to make the playoffs for the first time in eight years with a record of 44–38. The 2005–06 season brought more frustration for Garnett. Sprewell turned down a three-year, $21 million extension, and the Wolves wary of his injuries and age, traded Cassell for the much less effective Marko Jarić, and the team's record for 2005–06 fell to 33–49. Despite Garnett's play, the team logged the second-worst record since Garnett joined the franchise. The Timberwolves' record dropped further in 2006–07, going 32–50 that season. In both of those seasons, Garnett earned All-NBA Third Team honors.\n\n\nDuring the 2007 off-season, Glen Taylor admitted that although he planned on retaining Garnett, he finally listened to trade offers.[27] Garnett's name was mentioned in various trade rumors involving the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, and Dallas Mavericks.[28][29][30][31] Garnett later confirmed that his preferred trade destinations were the Lakers, Celtics, and Suns.[32] He had initially contacted Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant about joining the team as the Lakers were his initial top choice but Bryant didn't answer or return the calls. Garnett stated, \"I'm just being honest with everybody. I wanted to link with Kobe. Kobe and I had a different connect. When Kobe-Shaq went on their little thing, a lot of people went with Shaq. A lot of people didn't even fuck with Kobe. You know, Kobe, whatever. One of the very few to just stay with him. I was a neutral guy, anyway. I show everybody love. I tried to link with him, and I couldn't get him on the line.\"[32] The Lakers originally had a trade framework in place that involved Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum.[32]\n\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (2007–2013)[edit]\n\n\n#### NBA championship, DPOY award and injury (2007–2009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garnett in Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Playoffs against the Atlanta Hawks.\n![](image)Garnett dunking a ball in a game against the Washington Wizards.\nOn July 31, 2007, Garnett was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Theo Ratliff, cash considerations, Boston's 2009 first-round draft pick (top 3 protected), and the 2009 first-round pick which Minnesota traded to Boston in the Ricky Davis–Wally Szczerbiak trade of 2006.[33] The 7-for-1 deal constitutes the largest number of players traded for a single player in league history.[34] At the time of the trade, Garnett had the longest current tenure of any player in the NBA with one team, having played for the Timberwolves for his first 12 seasons (a total of 927 games). Garnett said that he was proud to be a part of the Celtics and hoped to continue its proud tradition and basketball success.[35][36][37] On the day the trade was announced, Garnett signed a three-year, $60 million contract extension that would start after his prior deal ran out in 2009. On August 1, the day after signing with the Celtics, Garnett threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park prior to a Red Sox–Orioles game.[38]\n\n\nThe trade for Garnett had many experts speculating that the Celtics would have a resurgence during the 2007–08 season.[39] The combination of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Garnett were almost automatically nicknamed \"The Big Three\" by the media, after the Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish trio.[40] Garnett wore jersey number 5 for the Celtics since his number with the Timberwolves, number 21, was retired by the Celtics, previously worn by Bill Sharman. He made his Boston debut with a strong performance against the Washington Wizards, with 22 points and 20 rebounds.[41] He also led all players in voting for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. Garnett received 2,399,148 votes, the sixth highest total in NBA All-Star balloting history.[42] However, Garnett was unable to play due to an abdominal strain, and Detroit Pistons forward Rasheed Wallace was named to replace him.[43][44][45] Garnett passed 20,000 points for his career, becoming the 32nd player in NBA history to reach the mark,[46] with a layup in the second quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies on March 8.[47] On April 22, Garnett was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year for the 2007–08 season.[48][49] It was the only major award a Celtic player had not claimed since the franchise's foundation in 1946.[50] Garnett said it was a team effort which helped him win the award.[51] Garnett was also third in MVP voting for the year, behind only Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul.[52] Garnett helped the Celtics to their 17th NBA Championship, with 26 points and 14 rebounds in Game 6 of the NBA Finals. During that championship season, Garnett and Celtics legend Bill Russell developed a relationship, which Garnett credited as a major influence in helping him succeed during his first season as a Celtic.[53] On June 18, 2008, Garnett and Ray Allen appeared on the *Late Show with David Letterman*, soon after winning the championship.[54]\n\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, Garnett started all of the 57 games he was able to suit up for. He averaged 15.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists. On October 31, 2008, Garnett became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 1,000 career games, at 32 years and 165 days.[55][56] Garnett earned his twelfth consecutive All-Star Game start on February 15, 2009. Following the All-Star Game, during a game against the Utah Jazz, Garnett injured his right knee late in the second quarter. The injury occurred on February 19, 2009 while attempting to go up for an alley-oop.[57] He was forced to miss the next 14 games. Upon his return, he averaged nine points and 4.5 rebounds in four games before being shut down for the season, missing the final 25 games of the regular season as well as the 2009 playoffs due to his injured knee.[58] In May 2009, he underwent knee surgery.[59] Without Garnett, the Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, but were eliminated by the Orlando Magic.\n\n\n\n#### Final All-Star appearances and falling short (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2009–10 season, Garnett and the Celtics, joined by newly signed free agent Rasheed Wallace, struggled with injuries and inconsistency throughout much of the regular season and earned the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Garnett was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game (his 13th All-Star Game selection). Despite being written off by nearly every major sports analyst, the Celtics elevated their play and consistency, and dominated opponents much as they did during their 2008 championship run. They eliminated the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Orlando Magic to advance to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals. In Game 6 against the Cavaliers, Garnett recorded 22 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists in the series-clinching win.[60] The 2010 Finals went to a decisive seventh game in Los Angeles, where the Celtics led well into the third quarter before the Lakers mounted a comeback and held on for the victory.[61]\n\n\nIn the 2010–11 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started strong, winning 23 of their first 26 games. On December 30, 2010, Garnett injured his right knee after he tried to dunk. He missed two weeks with the injury. Garnett returned on January 17, 2011 to face the Orlando Magic.[62] The Celtics ended the regular season third in the Eastern Conference behind the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat.[63] Garnett averaged under 15 points, under 9 rebounds, and a career low 0.8 blocks per game. After sweeping the New York Knicks in the first round, they faced the Heat in the semi-finals. After losing the first two games of the series, Garnett's playoff high 28 points helped the Celtics take Game 3. However, the Heat won the next two games, winning the series 4–1.[64]\n\n\nIn the lockout shortened 2011–12 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started off slowly, being below .500 with a 15–17 record by the All-Star break. Garnett was not selected for the All-Star game for the first time in 11 years. After, however, Boston quickly became one of the best teams in the league, finishing the second half of the season with a 24–10 record, entering the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 39–27 record. Boston made a deep run in the playoffs, going all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. They faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, defeating them in six games. Boston then defeated the Philadelphia 76ers after a challenging seven-game series. Boston made the Eastern Conference Finals for the third time in five years, and faced another superstar trio in Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James of the Miami Heat. The Celtics lost the first two games, but came back strong to win the next three games. However, the Heat were too strong in Games 6 and 7, defeating the Celtics 4–3. Garnett found a resurgence in the playoffs, averaging 19.2 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.\n\n\nOn June 30, 2012, Garnett agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Celtics worth an estimated $34 million.[65][66] On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Garnett was voted to start in the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston.[67] On February 7, 2013, Garnett recorded his 25,000th point in a 116–95 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.[68][69]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2021, the Celtics announced that they would retire Garnett's number 5 jersey on March 13, 2022, in a game against the Dallas Mavericks.[70]\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets (2013–2015)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 27, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks, and Keith Bogans. Two of the Celtics' picks eventually became future All-Stars Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.[71] The deal was finally completed on July 12 with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White.[72] Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy.[73][74]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103–99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons.[75] The Nets cherished Garnett's leadership and passion.[76] Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.[77]\n\n\nOn November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets' 102–90 win over the Detroit Pistons.[78] Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110–99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.[79]\n\n\n\n### Return to Minnesota (2015–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Garnett's first game back with the Timberwolves in 2015.\nOn February 19, 2015, Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause in order to be traded back to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young.[80] Six days later, he made his return for the Timberwolves against the Washington Wizards at the Target Center, recording five points on two-of-seven shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in 19 minutes in his first game for Minnesota since 2007.[81] He appeared in just five games for the Timberwolves in 2014–15, before sitting out the team's final 21 games of the season due to a nagging knee injury.[82]\n\n\nOn July 11, 2015, Garnett re-signed with the Timberwolves to a two-year deal.[83][84] On November 15, 2015, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Garnett became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 50,000 minutes, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Jason Kidd, and Elvin Hayes.[85] On December 1, against the Orlando Magic, Garnett surpassed Kidd (50,110) for third on the NBA's career minutes list.[86] Four days later, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the 15th player in NBA history to surpass 26,000 career points.[87] On December 11, Garnett passed Malone as the NBA's all-time leader in defensive rebounds during Minnesota's 111–108 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with four defensive boards to give him 11,409 for his career, three ahead of Malone.[88] Garnett appeared in 38 of the team's first 45 games of the season before missing the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury, the same knee that kept him out of 25 games in 2008–09 when he was playing for Boston, as well as much of his post-trade time in Minnesota during the 2014–15 season.[89]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2016, Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA.[90][91] While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team make it to the playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team's owner that he was not sure that his knees would hold up for one more season.[92]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2000 Summer Olympics, Garnett won a gold medal as a member of the United States national team. In his first and only FIBA tournament, Garnett averaged 10.8 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game.[93]\n\n\n\n## Post-playing career[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2016, Garnett joined the crew on TNT's *Inside the NBA*.[94] The following month, he became the host of his own segment *Area 21*.[95] In January 2017, Garnett joined the Los Angeles Clippers as a consultant.[96] He also consulted with the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2016–17 season.[97]\n\n\n\n### *Uncut Gems*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Uncut Gems\n\n> \n> \"You realize how hard he worked in acting—he must've worked three times as hard on the court\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—*Uncut Gems* producer Sebastian Bear-McClard on Garnett[98]\n\nGarnett plays a fictionalized version of himself in the 2019 crime thriller *Uncut Gems*, directed by the Safdie brothers.[99] The movie is set in 2012 and revolves around the Eastern Conference Semi-finals series between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. While playing in Philadelphia, Garnett makes a trip to a New York City jewelry store owned by Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) in the Diamond District. Garnett takes a liking to an Ethiopian opal which Ratner shows off. The story revolves around Garnett's performance in the series and relationship with the Opal, alongside Ratner's chaotic and intense personal life.\n\n\nGarnett's performance received positive reviews from critics.[100][101] The Safdie brothers picked Garnett after a series of rewrites based on available players. Prior to securing Garnett, the duo approached Amar'e Stoudemire, who refused to cut his hair to match the period;[101] and Kobe Bryant, whose representation said he wanted to direct and not act, though Bryant said he wasn't contacted;[102][101] and Joel Embiid, whose active NBA schedule could not accommodate filming.[101] Garnett was among the first non-active athletes they approached. Garnett said the process of filming \"felt special, but you didn't know it.\"[103]\n\n\nHe then subsequently signed a deal with Village Roadshow Pictures.[104]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGarnett wore clothing branded as \"OBF\", standing for Official Block Family. The name came from what he called his close group of friends from Beechwood Court in Mauldin, South Carolina. He brought OBF members to live with him in his Minnesota home, and let some on board some team's charter flights during road trips.[105][22][106] He met Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the Grammy-winning record producers for Janet Jackson and Boyz II Men, early in his career in Minnesota and considers them as mentors.[21]\n\n\nIn July 2004, Garnett married his longtime girlfriend Brandi Padilla during a private ceremony in California. Due to the wedding, Garnett did not take part in the Athens Olympic Games.[107] The couple has two daughters. On July 12, 2018, Garnett's wife filed for divorce, asking for custody of the children.[108][109] Garnett is the half-brother of former basketball player Louis McCullough. Another professional basketball player, former Los Angeles Laker Shammond Williams, is his cousin.[110]\n\n\nHis nicknames include \"The Big Ticket\", \"KG\", \"The Kid\", and formerly \"The Franchise\" (after being known as the Minnesota Timberwolves' franchise player).[14] He mentally prepared himself before games by banging his head against a padded basketball stanchion.[111] Although Garnett is officially listed as 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) by the NBA, he is widely accepted to be at least 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) tall.[112][113] During the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, Garnett admitted in an interview with Craig Sager to be \"6 ft 11 in and some quarters\" tall.[114] Measurements from the 1995 NBA draft indicated that Garnett, who was 19 years old at the time, was 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) tall barefoot.[115] In 1997, Garnett was measured by the Minnesota Timberwolves training staff to be 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) tall in his basketball shoes.[116] In December 2011, Garnett agreed to become a limited shareholder of American-owned Italian Serie A football team A.S. Roma.[117]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Simon & Schuster published Garnett's autobiography *KG: A to Z: An Uncensored Encyclopedia of Life, Basketball, and Everything in Between*, written with David Ritz. In part of the work, Garnett describes his successive involvement with various sneaker manufacturers.[118]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n |

He spent his entire 19-year career with the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Big Fundamental**\", he is widely regarded as the greatest power forward of all time and one of the greatest players in NBA history,[2][3][4] and was a central contributor to the franchise's success during the 2000s and 2010s.[5][6] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.\n\n\nBorn and raised on Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Duncan initially aspired to be a competitive swimmer, but took up basketball at 14 after Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized pool. In high school, he played basketball for St. Dunstan's Episcopal. In college, Duncan played for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and in his senior year, he received the John Wooden Award and was named the Naismith College Player of the Year and the USBWA College Player of the Year.\n\n\nAfter graduating from college, Duncan was the NBA Rookie of the Year after being selected by San Antonio with the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. He primarily played the power forward position and also played center throughout his career. He is a five-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA MVP, a three-time NBA Finals MVP, a 15-time NBA All-Star,[7] and the only player to be selected to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams for 13 consecutive seasons.[8]\n\n\nOff the court, Duncan created the Tim Duncan Foundation to raise health awareness and fund education and youth sports programs.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuncan was born and raised in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He is the son of immigrants from Anguilla: Ione, a professional midwife, and William Duncan, a mason. He has two older sisters, Cheryl and Tricia, and an older brother, Scott, who became a film director and cinematographer.[9] Cheryl was a champion swimmer before she became a nurse, and Tricia swam for the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.[10]\n\n\nIn school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like Tricia.[11][12] His parents were very supportive, and Duncan excelled at swimming, becoming a teenage standout in the 50-, 100-, and 400-meter freestyle and aiming to go to the 1992 Olympic Games as a member of the United States Team.[11]\n\n\nIn 1989, after Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool, Duncan was forced to swim in the ocean instead, and his fear of sharks ruined his enthusiasm for the sport.[11] He was dealt another emotional blow when his mother died of breast cancer on April 24, 1990, the day before his 14th birthday.[11] On her deathbed, she made Duncan and his sisters promise that they would graduate from college, going a long way in explaining Duncan's later refusal to leave college early for the NBA.[13]\n\n\nDuncan never swam competitively again, but his brother-in-law inspired him to turn to basketball.[13] Initially, Duncan had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. St. Croix Country Day School athletic director Nancy Pomroy has said, \"[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.\"[14] He overcame his awkwardness to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities.[15] Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom, in particular, grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.[11] Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.[11] Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.[16] But after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's demeanor and discovered that he was not only a talented athlete but also a quick learner.[16] Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware, and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nIn the year before Duncan's arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons had reached the Sweet 16, but then lost leading scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft.[11] In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was considering redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N'Diaye violated NCAA rules and eventually transferred to Michigan.[17] Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win–loss record.[11] Duncan's style of play was simple yet effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots, and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games.[11] Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.[16] Despite his heavy focus on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best said, \"Tim ... was one of my more intellectual students. ... Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.\"[16] Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as \"Mr. Spock\", the prototype of a logical, detached character from *Star Trek*.[16]\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 NCAA season, the sophomore was soon called one of the best prospects among those eligible for the NBA, along with peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry Stackhouse.[11] Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early; however, Duncan said that he had no intention of going pro before graduation, despite the NBA's plan to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. Though it meant passing up a large amount of money, Duncan was loath to deviate from his determination to stay in school.[11] In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against the Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels.[18] During that game, Duncan neutralized Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime.[11] In the NCAA tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16. Playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but Wake Forest still lost, 71–66. Duncan ended the season averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year, and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.[11] He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in his two remaining years at Wake Forest.[19]\n\n\nDuring the 1995–96 NCAA season, Wake Forest lost Childress, who had graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. In Childress's absence, Duncan led the team to a 12–4 ACC record, and a 26–6 record overall.[11] The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again,[20] but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four. His season averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game led to another ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and his first ACC Player of the Year award.[19][21] Although the Wake Forest star was now rumored to be entering the 1996 NBA draft, he stayed in college.[11]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 NCAA season, new 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) Demon Deacon and future NBA player Loren Woods eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The 1996–97 team won their first 13 games, but then came a slump, and they failed to win a third ACC title.[11] On January 12, 1997, Duncan scored 26 points and 14 rebounds in an 81–69 win against Duke.[22] On January 24, 1997, Duncan scored 16 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks in a 65–62 victory over Clemson.[23] Later, during the NCAA tournament, Stanford University, led by future NBA point guard Brevin Knight, eliminated Wake Forest with a 72–66 win.[24] Duncan finished his senior season with career high averages of 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game while shooting .606 from the field and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team All-American honors for the second time and was a unanimous pick for both the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Naismith College Player of the Year.[11] Duncan was first in the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, tenth in blocked shots (3.3 bpg), and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).[19] He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and, based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters, won the 1997 John Wooden Award as the NCAA's best overall male player.[25]\n\n\nIn contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, and Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed in college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997 and the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997. In 1996, he led the ACC in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage, and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories.[19] That same year, he was also named Most Valuable Player of the ACC Tournament. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (a mark later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). Duncan left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle—and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.[19]\n\n\nIn college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book *Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors* with Mark Leary.[26][27] After earning his college degree in psychology,[28] Duncan entered the 1997 NBA draft.[29] In 2009, Duncan was inducted into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame.[30]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs (1997–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### \"Twin Towers\" (1997–2003)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Twin Towers (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nIn the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Duncan with the first draft pick.[7] The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled 1996–97 season; their best player, David Robinson—himself a number one draft pick in 1987—was sidelined for most of the year, and they finished with a 20–62 win–loss record.[31] In the 1997–98 season, Duncan and Robinson became known as the \"Twin Towers\". The duo earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket.[11] From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: In his second road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against Chicago Bulls Hall-of-Fame power forward Dennis Rodman, a multiple rebounding champion and NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[32] Duncan was voted to the 1998 NBA All-Star Game by coaches. Later, when Duncan played against Houston Rockets Hall-of-Fame power forward Charles Barkley, Barkley was so impressed he said, \"I have seen the future and he wears number 21.\"[33] In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the first draft pick, starting in all 82 regular season games, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, and earning All-NBA First Team honors.[7] His defensive contributions ensured that he was chosen for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was also named NBA Rookie of the Year, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season.[15][34] Spurs coach Gregg Popovich lauded Duncan's mental toughness, stating his rookie's \"demeanor was singularly remarkable\", Duncan always \"put things into perspective\" and never got \"too upbeat or too depressed.\"[35] Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: \"He's the real thing. I'm proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player.\"[36]\n\n\nThe Spurs qualified for the 1998 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds[37] and replicating the performance in Game 2,[38] contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns.[11] However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference champions, Utah Jazz.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan at the free throw line in 2005\nDuring the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs started with a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach and finished the season with a 31–5 run.[40] The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams.[7] In the 1999 NBA playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals.[41] In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero,[42] and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the \"Twin Towers\" outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks.[42] After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win,[42] and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot,[42] and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point, 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship.[43] *Sports Illustrated* journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: \"Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [in Game 5].\" And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: \"I've got Tim and you don't. That's the difference.\"[43]\n\n\nIn the 1999–2000 season, Duncan further cemented his reputation. He averaged 23.2 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game, earning another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team nods.[7] However, the Spurs had a disappointing postseason. Duncan injured his meniscus shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in even one postseason game.[15] Consequently, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the 2000 NBA playoffs, losing 3–1 to the Phoenix Suns.[44]\n\n\nIn the next season, Duncan averaged 22.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.3 blocks per game. He was again named to the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams.[7] In the 2001 NBA playoffs, the Spurs eliminated the Timberwolves 3–1, defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4–1, but then bowed out against the Lakers (led by superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant) in four straight games.[45] *Sports Illustrated* described the series as a \"[m]erciless mismatch\", and Duncan was criticized as \"silent when the Spurs need him most\".[46]\n\n\nOn the back of two consecutive playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1,042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs.[7] Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team nods, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as one of only two Spurs players in history to have earned the honor.[47] On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled with the fact that the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often.[11] In the 2002 NBA playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions.[48] Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: \"I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes.\"[49] Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as \"phenomenal\" and criticized his supporting cast.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan (middle) and the Spurs at the White House after winning the 2003 NBA Finals\nIn the 2002–03 season, the Spurs began play at the SBC Center on November 1 by defeating the Toronto Raptors 91–72. In that game, Duncan recorded 22 points, 15 rebounds and 3 blocks for the Spurs.[50] He averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and earned All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team recognition, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[7][11] At age 37, Robinson had announced that the season would be his last; his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs.[11] The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Western Conference's number one seed with a 60–22 record.[51] In the Western Conference Semifinals against the Lakers, Duncan dominated forward Robert Horry[52] and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds.[52] The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship.[53] Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game,[54] and was named the NBA Finals MVP.[15] Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named *Sports Illustrated*'s 2003 \"Sportsmen of the Year\".[55]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the Spurs (2003–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duncan backing down Ben Wallace in a 2005 game\nOn July 16, 2003, Duncan signed a seven-year, $122 million contract with the Spurs.[56] Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs lost their perennial captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterović, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Manu Ginóbili and young French point guard Tony Parker. Coming off the bench were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis.[57] In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step into the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills.[58] Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks,[7] he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater, giving his team the win.[59][60] In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as one of the reasons for the loss.[61]\n\n\nDuncan and his Spurs looked to re-assert themselves in the next 2004–05 season. Despite their new captain's slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game),[7] the Spurs won the second seed for the 2005 NBA playoffs by winning 59 games.[62] In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the Denver Nuggets four games to one, and met the Seattle SuperSonics in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories,[11] setting up a meeting with the Phoenix Suns, known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4–1[11] and earning a spot in the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit's defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons double teamed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket.[11] Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3–3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons.[63] NBA.com reported that \"with his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch\", and coach Popovich added: \"[Duncan's] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, because if he didn't score, people think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us.\"[63] Pistons center Ben Wallace remarked: \"He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship. That's what the great players do.\"[63] Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan going up for a shot over the Lakers' Andrew Bynum\nDuring the 2005–06 season, Duncan suffered from plantar fasciitis for most of the season,[64] which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances.[7] The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense.[65] But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.[65]\n\n\nThe following season, however, was another championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per game in the regular season,[7] and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a meeting with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals.[66] There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship.[67] Duncan proclaimed that that championship was \"the best\" of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played \"sub-par\" and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten.[58] His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the \"Tim Duncan era\", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: \"Tim is the common denominator. He's [had] a different cast around him [in] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. ... But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in.\"[58] Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: \"[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He just happens to be one of the greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them.\"[58]\n\n\n\n#### Playoff disappointments (2007–2013)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Duncan was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.[68] For the season, he played 78 games and posted his typical 20/10 numbers,[69] San Antonio concluded the 2007–08 regular season with a 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs in three of the past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare three-pointer that sent the game into double overtime.[70] The trio of Duncan, Ginóbili and Parker continued playing to form for the remainder of the series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games.[71] In the first game of the next round against the Chris Paul-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds.[72] The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series.[73] Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6,[74] and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7.[75] However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan defending in the key against the Milwaukee Bucks in 2008\nDuncan started the 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his performance declined and he was subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis.[77] Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili for most of the season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record.[78][79] Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship.[79] As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.[80]\n\n\nWith the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the 2009–10 season, they acquired Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans.[81] The team got off to a 5–6 start, but a series of double-double performances by Duncan gave them a 9–6 record by the end of November. Duncan was subsequently named the Western Conference Player of the Week for the last week of November.[82] Even at 34 years of age, he remained a constant 20–10 threat, being only one of three players in the league at the mid-season to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 21, 2010, Duncan was named as the starting forward for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[83] After securing yet another 50-win season,[84] the Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round.[85]\n\n\nEleven games into the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played.[86] Along the way, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors.[87] 12 days later, in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games.[88] The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history[89]–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season.[90] Although Duncan produced career lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n\n\n![Duncan in a red shirt](image)Duncan as an All-Star for the West in 2011\nThe Spurs again finished the 2011–12 season as the number one seed in the West—it was a lockout-shortened 66-game season—tying with the Chicago Bulls for a league-best 50–16 record.[91] Prior to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 24, 2012, head coach Gregg Popovich decided to give Duncan a night off by listing him on the official scorecard as \"DNP-OLD\", poking fun at his 36-year-old body.[92] Overall, Duncan's numbers remained at par with the previous season. The triumvirate of Duncan-Parker-Ginóbili entered the 2012 NBA playoffs well-rested and healthy, and the Spurs swept the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers 4–0 in the first two rounds. On May 31, 2012, in the third game of the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Duncan set the record for most career blocks in playoffs history, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Spurs' playoff run came to an end when the Thunder defeated them 4–2.\n\n\nOn July 11, 2012, Duncan agreed to re-sign with the Spurs. Helped by a supporting cast comprising Danny Green, Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal and Kawhi Leonard that had been maturing steadily over the last two seasons, Duncan and the Spurs would again make the playoffs with a 58–24 regular season record. Duncan also returned to the All-Star line-up and was named to the All-NBA First Team. He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke George Gervin's record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season.[93][94] The Spurs met defending NBA champions Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul in a half of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.\n\n\n\n#### Fifth championship (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2013, Duncan became the oldest player to record a 20–20 game in NBA history, finishing with 23 points, 21 rebounds, and the game-winning jump shot against the Atlanta Hawks. The Spurs went on to conclude the 2013–14 regular season with a league-best 62 wins. The Spurs defeated Dallas in seven games in the first round of the playoffs, Portland in five games in the conference semifinals, and Oklahoma City in six games, where game 6 went into overtime, as the Spurs won, 112–107. They set up a Finals rematch against the Miami Heat, which they won, 4–1, setting a record margin for a win in the NBA Finals, for games 3 and 4. Along the way, the Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker trio broke the record for most wins in NBA playoffs history. After winning the Finals in five games, Duncan joined John Salley as the only players to win a championship in three different decades.[95] Chasing his fourth Finals MVP award in 2014, he failed to then-22-year-old Kawhi Leonard.[96]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2014, Duncan exercised his $10.3 million player option for the 2014–15 season.[97][98] On November 14, 2014, Duncan scored his 25,000th point in the first half of the Spurs' 93–80 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the 19th player in NBA history to reach the milestone.[99] On February 19, 2015, he passed Alex English to move into 16th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers.[100] On March 4, he recorded six rebounds against the Sacramento Kings, breaking his tie with Nate Thurmond for ninth in career rebounding.[101] Two days later, he recorded three blocks against the Denver Nuggets to surpass Patrick Ewing for sixth overall in career blocks.[102] On April 12, he played his 1,330th career game against the Phoenix Suns, which passed Moses Malone for 11th all-time. He also scored 22 points and passed Kevin Garnett to move into 14th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list.[103] The Spurs finished sixth in the Western Conference after 82 games and faced the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. Their quest for back-to-back championships was ended May 2 as they lost to the Clippers in seven games.[104] Duncan was later named to the All-Defensive second team on May 20 for the seventh time in his career.[105]\n\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Duncan re-signed with the Spurs to a two-year deal.[106] On November 2, 2015, in a win over the New York Knicks, Duncan recorded 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his NBA-record 954th victory with one team, surpassing John Stockton's 953 wins with the Utah Jazz.[107] On November 11, he pulled down the 14,716th rebound of his career against the Portland Trail Blazers to pass Robert Parish for seventh place on the NBA's all-time rebounding list.[108] On November 14, in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Duncan had five blocked shots to become the Spurs' franchise leader with 2,955 blocks, surpassing former teammate David Robinson's career total of 2,954. Duncan also moved into fifth all-time on the NBA's blocks list.[109] After missing the Spurs' last three games of December due to rest and right knee soreness, Duncan returned to action on January 2, 2016 against the Houston Rockets. In his return game, Duncan was held scoreless for the first time in his 19-year career;[110] giving him the most consecutive games with at least one point, at 1,359.[111] Four days later, Duncan scored a then-season high 18 points in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 30 straight regular season games dating to 2014–15.[112] On February 10, he returned to the starting lineup after missing eight games with a sore knee.[113] On February 27, in a win over the Houston Rockets, he became the fifth player in NBA history to reach 3,000 blocks. In addition, with six rebounds in the game, Duncan reached 14,971 for his career, surpassing Karl Malone (14,968) for sixth place in league history.[114] On March 10, Duncan became the sixth player in league history with 15,000 rebounds, completing the feat midway through the first quarter of the Spurs' 109–101 win over the Chicago Bulls.[115] On March 19, he came off the bench for only the third time in his career to counter the smaller lineup of the Golden State Warriors. With a win over the Warriors, the Spurs recorded their 35th straight home win of the season and their 44th straight at home dating to 2014–15, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history with the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls.[116] On April 5, in a win over the Utah Jazz, he became the third player with 1,000 victories in the regular season, following Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish. Duncan extended his mark as the NBA's career leader in victories with one team.[117] On April 8, he scored a season-high 21 points in a losing effort to the Denver Nuggets. Having already locked up second seed in the West with a franchise-best record (65–13 prior to Nuggets game), all four of Duncan's starting teammates were rested.[118] The Spurs went on to lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs.\n\n\n\n![Duncan from behind on the court](image)Duncan's 21 jersey was retired months after he stopped playing.\nOn June 28, 2016, Duncan opted into his $5.6 million contract for the 2016–17 season.[119] However, on July 11, 2016, he announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons with San Antonio.[120] In September 2016, coach Gregg Popovich indicated that Duncan would have a coaching role with the team in the 2016–17 season.[121]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2016, the Spurs retired Duncan's No. 21 jersey in a postgame ceremony, making him the eighth Spur in franchise history to have his jersey retired.[122]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Duncan was selected as one of the last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout.[123] Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him to stay out of the Olympic Games themselves.[19]\n\n\nIn 2003, Duncan was also a member of the USA team that recorded ten wins and qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics.[19] He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field.[19] At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal.[124] The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA players became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team lost a game in international competition and returned home without gold medals.[124] After the tournament, Duncan was disappointed with team's unpreparedness for the tournament and commented, \"I am about 95 percent sure my FIBA career is over. I'll try not to share my experiences with anyone.\"[125] In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 games.[19]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duncan (No. 21) attempting to block Kobe Bryant's shot in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center\nStanding at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), Duncan was a power forward who could also play center. With a double-double career average in points and rebounds, he was considered one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career.[63] Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league.[7] At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players,[126] while he led the charts in postseason point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.[7]\n\n\nApart from his impressive statistics, Duncan has gained a reputation as a clutch player, as evidenced by his three NBA Finals MVP awards and his playoff career averages being higher than his regular season statistics.[7] Eleven-time NBA champion Bill Russell further complimented Duncan on his passing ability, and rated him as one of the most efficient players of his generation,[127] a view shared by 19-time NBA All-Star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.[128] Because of his versatility and success, basketball experts widely consider Duncan to be the greatest power forward in NBA history,[2][3] while coach Popovich and teammates Parker and Ginóbili have also credited much of San Antonio's success to him.[129][130] Duncan's detractors, however, label him as \"boring\" because of his simple but effective style of play (thus earning him the nickname \"The Big Fundamental\"). Following his first championship ring in 1999, *Sports Illustrated* described him as a \"quiet, boring MVP\",[131] a characterization which persists today.[127]\n\n\nDuncan himself commented on his \"boring\" image, stating, \"If you show excitement, then you also may show disappointment or frustration. If your opponent picks up on this frustration, you are at a disadvantage.\"[132] Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented on his ability to relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents.[133] Shaquille O'Neal had high praise for Duncan's on-court demeanor. \"The Spurs won because of Tim Duncan, a guy I could never break,\" O'Neal wrote in his autobiography. \"I could talk trash to Patrick Ewing, get in David Robinson's face, get a rise out of Alonzo Mourning, but when I went at Tim he'd look at me like he was bored.\"[134]\n\n\nDuncan has stated that he especially likes his bank shot, saying: \"It is just easy for me. It just feels good.\"[135] Additionally, Duncan's close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been described as \"the greatest love story in sports\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Honors[edit]\n\n\nDuring his basketball career, Duncan received a number of individual and team honors, including being a two-time MVP (2002, 2003), five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), and three-time NBA Finals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005). As a college player, he was honored by the House of Representatives,[137] named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, won the John R. Wooden Award and Adolph Rupp Trophy, and was selected as the Naismith College Player of the Year in addition to player of the year honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and *Sporting News* (all 1997).[19] In 2002, Duncan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[138] In his debut year in the NBA (1998), he was voted Rookie of the Year and elected into the All-Rookie Team. He has been named to 15 NBA All-Star teams (1997–98; 1999–2000 to 2010–11; 2012–13 and 2014–15), 15 All-NBA Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15; ten First Team nominations), and 15 All-Defensive Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10; 2012–13, 2014–15; eight First Team nominations).[7] With these impressive performances, Duncan is one of only four players to receive All-NBA First Team honors in each of his first eight seasons (1998–2005), along with Hall-of-Famers Bob Pettit (ten seasons), Larry Bird (nine seasons), and Oscar Robertson (nine seasons), and is the only player in NBA history to receive All-NBA and All-Defensive honors in his first 13 seasons (1997–98 to 2009–10).[139]\n\n\nDuncan was also named by the Association for Professional Basketball Research as one of the \"100 Greatest Professional Basketball Players of the 20th Century\", and is the youngest player on that list.[140] In the 2001–02 season, he won the IBM Player Award[141] and the *Sporting News* (TSN) MVP Award,[142] becoming the third player to ever win the NBA MVP, IBM Player and TSN Player Awards in the same season. On February 18, 2006, he was named one of the *Next 10 Greatest Players* on the tenth anniversary of the release of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team by the TNT broadcasting crew.[143] In 2009, Duncan was ranked 8th by *Slam* magazine in their list of the top 50 NBA players of all time,[144] while *Sports Illustrated* named him its NBA Player of the Decade.[145] In 2022, to commemorate the

with members of the North Carolina Air National Guard at Cyril E. King Airport in 2017 after unloading 77,000 pounds of food donated by Duncan following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria\nDuncan married Amy Sherrill in July 2001,[15] and had two children before their divorce in August 2013.[156] In 2017, Duncan and his girlfriend welcomed their first child.[157]\n\n\nIn 2001,[158] Duncan established the Tim Duncan Foundation to fund programs involving health awareness and research, education, and youth sports and recreation in San Antonio, Winston-Salem, and the United States Virgin Islands.[15] The foundation's major events have included the Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic.[15] Between 2001 and 2002, the foundation raised more than $350,000 for breast and prostate cancer research.[25] In those two years, Duncan was named by *Sporting News* as one of the \"Good Guys\" in sports.[25] Duncan has also supported the Children's Bereavement Center, the Children's Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.[15] In August 2017, BlackJack Speed Shop, in partnership with The Tim Duncan Foundation, organized urgently needed supplies for victims of Hurricane Harvey.[159]\n\n\nDuncan cites his late mother as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme \"Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest/Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best\", which he adopted as his personal motto.[13] On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.[13] The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose No. 21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson as his childhood idol.[13]\n\n\nDuncan was honored with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Virgin Islands territorial government, and has been celebrated in several \"Tim Duncan Day\" ceremonies.[160] In 2000, Legislature of the Virgin Islands President Vargrave Richards said, \"He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla.\"[160]\n\n\nDuncan enjoys Renaissance fairs and the fantasy role-playing game *Dungeons & Dragons*.[161]\n\n\nIn 2015, Duncan sued his former investment adviser, claiming over $20 million in losses.[162] In September 2016, a federal grand jury indicted the adviser on two counts of wire fraud related to the case.[162] In April 2017, the adviser pled guilty to wire fraud in the case;[163] in June 2018, he reached a settlement and received $7.5 million.[164]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Duncan offered to pay for airline tickets for college students in the U.S. Virgin Islands to travel home during the COVID-19 pandemic.[165]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff triple-double leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\n* List of NBA players who have spent their entire career with one franchise\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career rebounding leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Duncan Q&A\". slamduncan.com.

He spent his entire 19-year career with the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Big Fundamental**\", he is widely regarded as the greatest power forward of all time and one of the greatest players in NBA history,[2][3][4] and was a central contributor to the franchise's success during the 2000s and 2010s.[5][6] He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.\n\n\nBorn and raised on Saint Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Duncan initially aspired to be a competitive swimmer, but took up basketball at 14 after Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized pool. In high school, he played basketball for St. Dunstan's Episcopal. In college, Duncan played for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons, and in his senior year, he received the John Wooden Award and was named the Naismith College Player of the Year and the USBWA College Player of the Year.\n\n\nAfter graduating from college, Duncan was the NBA Rookie of the Year after being selected by San Antonio with the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA draft. He primarily played the power forward position and also played center throughout his career. He is a five-time NBA champion, a two-time NBA MVP, a three-time NBA Finals MVP, a 15-time NBA All-Star,[7] and the only player to be selected to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive Teams for 13 consecutive seasons.[8]\n\n\nOff the court, Duncan created the Tim Duncan Foundation to raise health awareness and fund education and youth sports programs.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDuncan was born and raised in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He is the son of immigrants from Anguilla: Ione, a professional midwife, and William Duncan, a mason. He has two older sisters, Cheryl and Tricia, and an older brother, Scott, who became a film director and cinematographer.[9] Cheryl was a champion swimmer before she became a nurse, and Tricia swam for the U.S. Virgin Islands at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.[10]\n\n\nIn school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like Tricia.[11][12] His parents were very supportive, and Duncan excelled at swimming, becoming a teenage standout in the 50-, 100-, and 400-meter freestyle and aiming to go to the 1992 Olympic Games as a member of the United States Team.[11]\n\n\nIn 1989, after Hurricane Hugo destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool, Duncan was forced to swim in the ocean instead, and his fear of sharks ruined his enthusiasm for the sport.[11] He was dealt another emotional blow when his mother died of breast cancer on April 24, 1990, the day before his 14th birthday.[11] On her deathbed, she made Duncan and his sisters promise that they would graduate from college, going a long way in explaining Duncan's later refusal to leave college early for the NBA.[13]\n\n\nDuncan never swam competitively again, but his brother-in-law inspired him to turn to basketball.[13] Initially, Duncan had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. St. Croix Country Day School athletic director Nancy Pomroy has said, \"[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time.\"[14] He overcame his awkwardness to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities.[15] Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom, in particular, grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game.[11] Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket.[11] Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation.[16] But after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's demeanor and discovered that he was not only a talented athlete but also a quick learner.[16] Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware, and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nIn the year before Duncan's arrival at Wake Forest University, the Demon Deacons had reached the Sweet 16, but then lost leading scorer Rodney Rogers, who entered the 1993 NBA draft.[11] In the 1993–94 NCAA season, Coach Dave Odom was considering redshirting Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man Makhtar N'Diaye violated NCAA rules and eventually transferred to Michigan.[17] Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate Randolph Childress led the Deacons to a 20–11 win–loss record.[11] Duncan's style of play was simple yet effective, combining an array of low-post moves, mid-range bank shots, and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 Goodwill Games.[11] Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in anthropology and Chinese literature.[16] Despite his heavy focus on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best said, \"Tim ... was one of my more intellectual students. ... Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest.\"[16] Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as \"Mr. Spock\", the prototype of a logical, detached character from *Star Trek*.[16]\n\n\nIn the 1994–95 NCAA season, the sophomore was soon called one of the best prospects among those eligible for the NBA, along with peers Joe Smith, Rasheed Wallace, and Jerry Stackhouse.[11] Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the 1995 NBA draft if he went early; however, Duncan said that he had no intention of going pro before graduation, despite the NBA's plan to add a rookie salary cap in 1996. Though it meant passing up a large amount of money, Duncan was loath to deviate from his determination to stay in school.[11] In that season, he led the Demon Deacons into the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship game against the Rasheed Wallace-led North Carolina Tar Heels.[18] During that game, Duncan neutralized Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a jump shot with four seconds left in overtime.[11] In the NCAA tournament, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16. Playing against Oklahoma State, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying Bryant Reeves, but Wake Forest still lost, 71–66. Duncan ended the season averaging 16.8 points and 12.5 rebounds per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year, and became the third-best shot-blocker in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game.[11] He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in his two remaining years at Wake Forest.[19]\n\n\nDuring the 1995–96 NCAA season, Wake Forest lost Childress, who had graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. In Childress's absence, Duncan led the team to a 12–4 ACC record, and a 26–6 record overall.[11] The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again,[20] but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the Final Four. His season averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game led to another ACC Defensive Player of the Year award and his first ACC Player of the Year award.[19][21] Although the Wake Forest star was now rumored to be entering the 1996 NBA draft, he stayed in college.[11]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 NCAA season, new 7 ft 1 in (2.16 m) Demon Deacon and future NBA player Loren Woods eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The 1996–97 team won their first 13 games, but then came a slump, and they failed to win a third ACC title.[11] On January 12, 1997, Duncan scored 26 points and 14 rebounds in an 81–69 win against Duke.[22] On January 24, 1997, Duncan scored 16 points, 15 rebounds and 5 blocks in a 65–62 victory over Clemson.[23] Later, during the NCAA tournament, Stanford University, led by future NBA point guard Brevin Knight, eliminated Wake Forest with a 72–66 win.[24] Duncan finished his senior season with career high averages of 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game while shooting .606 from the field and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team All-American honors for the second time and was a unanimous pick for both the Oscar Robertson Trophy and Naismith College Player of the Year.[11] Duncan was first in the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, tenth in blocked shots (3.3 bpg), and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg).[19] He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and, based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters, won the 1997 John Wooden Award as the NCAA's best overall male player.[25]\n\n\nIn contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady, and Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed in college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997 and the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997. In 1996, he led the ACC in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage, and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories.[19] That same year, he was also named Most Valuable Player of the ACC Tournament. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (a mark later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). Duncan left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle—and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds.[19]\n\n\nIn college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book *Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors* with Mark Leary.[26][27] After earning his college degree in psychology,[28] Duncan entered the 1997 NBA draft.[29] In 2009, Duncan was inducted into the Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame.[30]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs (1997–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### \"Twin Towers\" (1997–2003)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Twin Towers (San Antonio Spurs)\n\nIn the 1997 NBA draft, the San Antonio Spurs drafted Duncan with the first draft pick.[7] The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled 1996–97 season; their best player, David Robinson—himself a number one draft pick in 1987—was sidelined for most of the year, and they finished with a 20–62 win–loss record.[31] In the 1997–98 season, Duncan and Robinson became known as the \"Twin Towers\". The duo earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket.[11] From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: In his second road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against Chicago Bulls Hall-of-Fame power forward Dennis Rodman, a multiple rebounding champion and NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[32] Duncan was voted to the 1998 NBA All-Star Game by coaches. Later, when Duncan played against Houston Rockets Hall-of-Fame power forward Charles Barkley, Barkley was so impressed he said, \"I have seen the future and he wears number 21.\"[33] In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the first draft pick, starting in all 82 regular season games, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, and earning All-NBA First Team honors.[7] His defensive contributions ensured that he was chosen for the NBA All-Defensive Second Team and was also named NBA Rookie of the Year, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season.[15][34] Spurs coach Gregg Popovich lauded Duncan's mental toughness, stating his rookie's \"demeanor was singularly remarkable\", Duncan always \"put things into perspective\" and never got \"too upbeat or too depressed.\"[35] Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: \"He's the real thing. I'm proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player.\"[36]\n\n\nThe Spurs qualified for the 1998 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the Phoenix Suns, causing Suns coach Danny Ainge to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds[37] and replicating the performance in Game 2,[38] contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns.[11] However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference champions, Utah Jazz.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan at the free throw line in 2005\nDuring the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Spurs started with a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach and finished the season with a 31–5 run.[40] The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the All-NBA and All-Defense First Teams.[7] In the 1999 NBA playoffs, the Spurs defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3–1, swept the Los Angeles Lakers and the Portland Trail Blazers 4–0, and defeated the Cinderella New York Knicks 4–1 in the Finals.[41] In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero,[42] and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the \"Twin Towers\" outscored their Knicks counterparts Chris Dudley/Larry Johnson with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks.[42] After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three turnovers in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win,[42] and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. Double teamed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks swingman Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second desperation shot,[42] and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point, 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named Finals MVP, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship.[43] *Sports Illustrated* journalist and retired NBA player Alex English added: \"Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [in Game 5].\" And Popovich later said to losing coach Jeff Van Gundy: \"I've got Tim and you don't. That's the difference.\"[43]\n\n\nIn the 1999–2000 season, Duncan further cemented his reputation. He averaged 23.2 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game, earning another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team nods.[7] However, the Spurs had a disappointing postseason. Duncan injured his meniscus shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in even one postseason game.[15] Consequently, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the 2000 NBA playoffs, losing 3–1 to the Phoenix Suns.[44]\n\n\nIn the next season, Duncan averaged 22.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists, and 2.3 blocks per game. He was again named to the All-NBA and All-Defensive First Teams.[7] In the 2001 NBA playoffs, the Spurs eliminated the Timberwolves 3–1, defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4–1, but then bowed out against the Lakers (led by superstars Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant) in four straight games.[45] *Sports Illustrated* described the series as a \"[m]erciless mismatch\", and Duncan was criticized as \"silent when the Spurs need him most\".[46]\n\n\nOn the back of two consecutive playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1,042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs.[7] Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team nods, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as one of only two Spurs players in history to have earned the honor.[47] On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled with the fact that the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often.[11] In the 2002 NBA playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions.[48] Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: \"I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes.\"[49] Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as \"phenomenal\" and criticized his supporting cast.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan (middle) and the Spurs at the White House after winning the 2003 NBA Finals\nIn the 2002–03 season, the Spurs began play at the SBC Center on November 1 by defeating the Toronto Raptors 91–72. In that game, Duncan recorded 22 points, 15 rebounds and 3 blocks for the Spurs.[50] He averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and earned All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team recognition, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award.[7][11] At age 37, Robinson had announced that the season would be his last; his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs.[11] The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Western Conference's number one seed with a 60–22 record.[51] In the Western Conference Semifinals against the Lakers, Duncan dominated forward Robert Horry[52] and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds.[52] The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship.[53] Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game,[54] and was named the NBA Finals MVP.[15] Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named *Sports Illustrated*'s 2003 \"Sportsmen of the Year\".[55]\n\n\n\n#### Leader of the Spurs (2003–2007)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duncan backing down Ben Wallace in a 2005 game\nOn July 16, 2003, Duncan signed a seven-year, $122 million contract with the Spurs.[56] Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs lost their perennial captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterović, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Manu Ginóbili and young French point guard Tony Parker. Coming off the bench were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis.[57] In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step into the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills.[58] Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks,[7] he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a buzzer beater, giving his team the win.[59][60] In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as one of the reasons for the loss.[61]\n\n\nDuncan and his Spurs looked to re-assert themselves in the next 2004–05 season. Despite their new captain's slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game),[7] the Spurs won the second seed for the 2005 NBA playoffs by winning 59 games.[62] In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the Denver Nuggets four games to one, and met the Seattle SuperSonics in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories,[11] setting up a meeting with the Phoenix Suns, known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4–1[11] and earning a spot in the 2005 NBA Finals against the Detroit Pistons. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit's defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons double teamed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket.[11] Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3–3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons.[63] NBA.com reported that \"with his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch\", and coach Popovich added: \"[Duncan's] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, because if he didn't score, people think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us.\"[63] Pistons center Ben Wallace remarked: \"He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship. That's what the great players do.\"[63] Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan going up for a shot over the Lakers' Andrew Bynum\nDuring the 2005–06 season, Duncan suffered from plantar fasciitis for most of the season,[64] which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances.[7] The big man came back strong in the 2006 NBA playoffs against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward Dirk Nowitzki 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center Erick Dampier able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense.[65] But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and Keith Van Horn, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center DeSagana Diop, and the Spurs lost Game 7.[65]\n\n\nThe following season, however, was another championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per game in the regular season,[7] and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, his ninth appearance in the event. In the playoffs, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a meeting with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals.[66] There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship.[67] Duncan proclaimed that that championship was \"the best\" of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played \"sub-par\" and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten.[58] His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the \"Tim Duncan era\", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: \"Tim is the common denominator. He's [had] a different cast around him [in] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. ... But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in.\"[58] Then-NBA commissioner David Stern added: \"[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and Pete Sampras is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't Andre Agassi or John McEnroe. He just happens to be one of the greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them.\"[58]\n\n\n\n#### Playoff disappointments (2007–2013)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Duncan was a member of the San Antonio team that won the Shooting Stars Competition.[68] For the season, he played 78 games and posted his typical 20/10 numbers,[69] San Antonio concluded the 2007–08 regular season with a 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and New Orleans Hornets in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs in three of the past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare three-pointer that sent the game into double overtime.[70] The trio of Duncan, Ginóbili and Parker continued playing to form for the remainder of the series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games.[71] In the first game of the next round against the Chris Paul-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds.[72] The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series.[73] Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6,[74] and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7.[75] However, arch-rivals Los Angeles Lakers defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duncan defending in the key against the Milwaukee Bucks in 2008\nDuncan started the 2008–09 season with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his performance declined and he was subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee tendinosis.[77] Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili for most of the season, San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54–28 record.[78][79] Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship.[79] As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.[80]\n\n\nWith the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the 2009–10 season, they acquired Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans.[81] The team got off to a 5–6 start, but a series of double-double performances by Duncan gave them a 9–6 record by the end of November. Duncan was subsequently named the Western Conference Player of the Week for the last week of November.[82] Even at 34 years of age, he remained a constant 20–10 threat, being only one of three players in the league at the mid-season to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 21, 2010, Duncan was named as the starting forward for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.[83] After securing yet another 50-win season,[84] the Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round.[85]\n\n\nEleven games into the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played.[86] Along the way, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors.[87] 12 days later, in a game against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games.[88] The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history[89]–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season.[90] Although Duncan produced career lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n\n\n![Duncan in a red shirt](image)Duncan as an All-Star for the West in 2011\nThe Spurs again finished the 2011–12 season as the number one seed in the West—it was a lockout-shortened 66-game season—tying with the Chicago Bulls for a league-best 50–16 record.[91] Prior to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 24, 2012, head coach Gregg Popovich decided to give Duncan a night off by listing him on the official scorecard as \"DNP-OLD\", poking fun at his 36-year-old body.[92] Overall, Duncan's numbers remained at par with the previous season. The triumvirate of Duncan-Parker-Ginóbili entered the 2012 NBA playoffs well-rested and healthy, and the Spurs swept the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers 4–0 in the first two rounds. On May 31, 2012, in the third game of the Western Conference Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Duncan set the record for most career blocks in playoffs history, surpassing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Spurs' playoff run came to an end when the Thunder defeated them 4–2.\n\n\nOn July 11, 2012, Duncan agreed to re-sign with the Spurs. Helped by a supporting cast comprising Danny Green, Tiago Splitter, Gary Neal and Kawhi Leonard that had been maturing steadily over the last two seasons, Duncan and the Spurs would again make the playoffs with a 58–24 regular season record. Duncan also returned to the All-Star line-up and was named to the All-NBA First Team. He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke George Gervin's record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In Game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season.[93][94] The Spurs met defending NBA champions Miami Heat in the NBA Finals in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul in a half of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.\n\n\n\n#### Fifth championship (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2013, Duncan became the oldest player to record a 20–20 game in NBA history, finishing with 23 points, 21 rebounds, and the game-winning jump shot against the Atlanta Hawks. The Spurs went on to conclude the 2013–14 regular season with a league-best 62 wins. The Spurs defeated Dallas in seven games in the first round of the playoffs, Portland in five games in the conference semifinals, and Oklahoma City in six games, where game 6 went into overtime, as the Spurs won, 112–107. They set up a Finals rematch against the Miami Heat, which they won, 4–1, setting a record margin for a win in the NBA Finals, for games 3 and 4. Along the way, the Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker trio broke the record for most wins in NBA playoffs history. After winning the Finals in five games, Duncan joined John Salley as the only players to win a championship in three different decades.[95] Chasing his fourth Finals MVP award in 2014, he failed to then-22-year-old Kawhi Leonard.[96]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2014, Duncan exercised his $10.3 million player option for the 2014–15 season.[97][98] On November 14, 2014, Duncan scored his 25,000th point in the first half of the Spurs' 93–80 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the 19th player in NBA history to reach the milestone.[99] On February 19, 2015, he passed Alex English to move into 16th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers.[100] On March 4, he recorded six rebounds against the Sacramento Kings, breaking his tie with Nate Thurmond for ninth in career rebounding.[101] Two days later, he recorded three blocks against the Denver Nuggets to surpass Patrick Ewing for sixth overall in career blocks.[102] On April 12, he played his 1,330th career game against the Phoenix Suns, which passed Moses Malone for 11th all-time. He also scored 22 points and passed Kevin Garnett to move into 14th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list.[103] The Spurs finished sixth in the Western Conference after 82 games and faced the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. Their quest for back-to-back championships was ended May 2 as they lost to the Clippers in seven games.[104] Duncan was later named to the All-Defensive second team on May 20 for the seventh time in his career.[105]\n\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Duncan re-signed with the Spurs to a two-year deal.[106] On November 2, 2015, in a win over the New York Knicks, Duncan recorded 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his NBA-record 954th victory with one team, surpassing John Stockton's 953 wins with the Utah Jazz.[107] On November 11, he pulled down the 14,716th rebound of his career against the Portland Trail Blazers to pass Robert Parish for seventh place on the NBA's all-time rebounding list.[108] On November 14, in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Duncan had five blocked shots to become the Spurs' franchise leader with 2,955 blocks, surpassing former teammate David Robinson's career total of 2,954. Duncan also moved into fifth all-time on the NBA's blocks list.[109] After missing the Spurs' last three games of December due to rest and right knee soreness, Duncan returned to action on January 2, 2016 against the Houston Rockets. In his return game, Duncan was held scoreless for the first time in his 19-year career;[110] giving him the most consecutive games with at least one point, at 1,359.[111] Four days later, Duncan scored a then-season high 18 points in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 30 straight regular season games dating to 2014–15.[112] On February 10, he returned to the starting lineup after missing eight games with a sore knee.[113] On February 27, in a win over the Houston Rockets, he became the fifth player in NBA history to reach 3,000 blocks. In addition, with six rebounds in the game, Duncan reached 14,971 for his career, surpassing Karl Malone (14,968) for sixth place in league history.[114] On March 10, Duncan became the sixth player in league history with 15,000 rebounds, completing the feat midway through the first quarter of the Spurs' 109–101 win over the Chicago Bulls.[115] On March 19, he came off the bench for only the third time in his career to counter the smaller lineup of the Golden State Warriors. With a win over the Warriors, the Spurs recorded their 35th straight home win of the season and their 44th straight at home dating to 2014–15, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history with the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls.[116] On April 5, in a win over the Utah Jazz, he became the third player with 1,000 victories in the regular season, following Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Robert Parish. Duncan extended his mark as the NBA's career leader in victories with one team.[117] On April 8, he scored a season-high 21 points in a losing effort to the Denver Nuggets. Having already locked up second seed in the West with a franchise-best record (65–13 prior to Nuggets game), all four of Duncan's starting teammates were rested.[118] The Spurs went on to lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs.\n\n\n\n![Duncan from behind on the court](image)Duncan's 21 jersey was retired months after he stopped playing.\nOn June 28, 2016, Duncan opted into his $5.6 million contract for the 2016–17 season.[119] However, on July 11, 2016, he announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons with San Antonio.[120] In September 2016, coach Gregg Popovich indicated that Duncan would have a coaching role with the team in the 2016–17 season.[121]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2016, the Spurs retired Duncan's No. 21 jersey in a postgame ceremony, making him the eighth Spur in franchise history to have his jersey retired.[122]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1998, Duncan was selected as one of the last two players for the United States national team for the World Basketball Championship. However, this team was later replaced with CBA and college players because of the NBA lockout.[123] Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but a knee injury forced him to stay out of the Olympic Games themselves.[19]\n\n\nIn 2003, Duncan was also a member of the USA team that recorded ten wins and qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics.[19] He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field.[19] At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal.[124] The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA players became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team lost a game in international competition and returned home without gold medals.[124] After the tournament, Duncan was disappointed with team's unpreparedness for the tournament and commented, \"I am about 95 percent sure my FIBA career is over. I'll try not to share my experiences with anyone.\"[125] In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 games.[19]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Duncan (No. 21) attempting to block Kobe Bryant's shot in a game against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center\nStanding at 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), Duncan was a power forward who could also play center. With a double-double career average in points and rebounds, he was considered one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career.[63] Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league.[7] At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players,[126] while he led the charts in postseason point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.[7]\n\n\nApart from his impressive statistics, Duncan has gained a reputation as a clutch player, as evidenced by his three NBA Finals MVP awards and his playoff career averages being higher than his regular season statistics.[7] Eleven-time NBA champion Bill Russell further complimented Duncan on his passing ability, and rated him as one of the most efficient players of his generation,[127] a view shared by 19-time NBA All-Star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.[128] Because of his versatility and success, basketball experts widely consider Duncan to be the greatest power forward in NBA history,[2][3] while coach Popovich and teammates Parker and Ginóbili have also credited much of San Antonio's success to him.[129][130] Duncan's detractors, however, label him as \"boring\" because of his simple but effective style of play (thus earning him the nickname \"The Big Fundamental\"). Following his first championship ring in 1999, *Sports Illustrated* described him as a \"quiet, boring MVP\",[131] a characterization which persists today.[127]\n\n\nDuncan himself commented on his \"boring\" image, stating, \"If you show excitement, then you also may show disappointment or frustration. If your opponent picks up on this frustration, you are at a disadvantage.\"[132] Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented on his ability to relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents.[133] Shaquille O'Neal had high praise for Duncan's on-court demeanor. \"The Spurs won because of Tim Duncan, a guy I could never break,\" O'Neal wrote in his autobiography. \"I could talk trash to Patrick Ewing, get in David Robinson's face, get a rise out of Alonzo Mourning, but when I went at Tim he'd look at me like he was bored.\"[134]\n\n\nDuncan has stated that he especially likes his bank shot, saying: \"It is just easy for me. It just feels good.\"[135] Additionally, Duncan's close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been described as \"the greatest love story in sports\".[136]\n\n\n\n### Honors[edit]\n\n\nDuring his basketball career, Duncan received a number of individual and team honors, including being a two-time MVP (2002, 2003), five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014), and three-time NBA Finals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005). As a college player, he was honored by the House of Representatives,[137] named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, won the John R. Wooden Award and Adolph Rupp Trophy, and was selected as the Naismith College Player of the Year in addition to player of the year honors from the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) and *Sporting News* (all 1997).[19] In 2002, Duncan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.[138] In his debut year in the NBA (1998), he was voted Rookie of the Year and elected into the All-Rookie Team. He has been named to 15 NBA All-Star teams (1997–98; 1999–2000 to 2010–11; 2012–13 and 2014–15), 15 All-NBA Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15; ten First Team nominations), and 15 All-Defensive Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10; 2012–13, 2014–15; eight First Team nominations).[7] With these impressive performances, Duncan is one of only four players to receive All-NBA First Team honors in each of his first eight seasons (1998–2005), along with Hall-of-Famers Bob Pettit (ten seasons), Larry Bird (nine seasons), and Oscar Robertson (nine seasons), and is the only player in NBA history to receive All-NBA and All-Defensive honors in his first 13 seasons (1997–98 to 2009–10).[139]\n\n\nDuncan was also named by the Association for Professional Basketball Research as one of the \"100 Greatest Professional Basketball Players of the 20th Century\", and is the youngest player on that list.[140] In the 2001–02 season, he won the IBM Player Award[141] and the *Sporting News* (TSN) MVP Award,[142] becoming the third player to ever win the NBA MVP, IBM Player and TSN Player Awards in the same season. On February 18, 2006, he was named one of the *Next 10 Greatest Players* on the tenth anniversary of the release of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team by the TNT broadcasting crew.[143] In 2009, Duncan was ranked 8th by *Slam* magazine in their list of the top 50 NBA players of all time,[144] while *Sports Illustrated* named him its NBA Player of the Decade.[145] In 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Duncan as the ninth greatest player in NBA history, the highest ranked power forward on the list.[146]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, it was announced that Duncan would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 29.[147][148] He was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.[149]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n### San Antonio Spurs (2019–2020)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, the San Antonio Spurs announced that Duncan was named an assistant coach.[150][151][152] He made his debut as acting head coach on March 3, 2020, leading the Spurs to a 104–103 comeback win over the Charlotte Hornets, which Popovich missed due to personal reasons.[153]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Duncan stepped down as assistant coach of the Spurs.[154]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per

with members of the North Carolina Air National Guard at Cyril E. King Airport in 2017 after unloading 77,000 pounds of food donated by Duncan following Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria\nDuncan married Amy Sherrill in July 2001,[15] and had two children before their divorce in August 2013.[156] In 2017, Duncan and his girlfriend welcomed their first child.[157]\n\n\nIn 2001,[158] Duncan established the Tim Duncan Foundation to fund programs involving health awareness and research, education, and youth sports and recreation in San Antonio, Winston-Salem, and the United States Virgin Islands.[15] The foundation's major events have included the Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic.[15] Between 2001 and 2002, the foundation raised more than $350,000 for breast and prostate cancer research.[25] In those two years, Duncan was named by *Sporting News* as one of the \"Good Guys\" in sports.[25] Duncan has also supported the Children's Bereavement Center, the Children's Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.[15] In August 2017, BlackJack Speed Shop, in partnership with The Tim Duncan Foundation, organized urgently needed supplies for victims of Hurricane Harvey.[159]\n\n\nDuncan cites his late mother as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme \"Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest/Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best\", which he adopted as his personal motto.[13] On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie.[13] The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose No. 21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame Los Angeles Lakers point guard Magic Johnson as his childhood idol.[13]\n\n\nDuncan was honored with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Virgin Islands territorial government, and has been celebrated in several \"Tim Duncan Day\" ceremonies.[160] In 2000, Legislature of the Virgin Islands President Vargrave Richards said, \"He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla.\"[160]\n\n\nDuncan enjoys Renaissance fairs and the fantasy role-playing game *Dungeons & Dragons*.[161]\n\n\nIn 2015, Duncan sued his former investment adviser, claiming over $20 million in losses.[162] In September 2016, a federal grand jury indicted the adviser on two counts of wire fraud related to the case.[162] In April 2017, the adviser pled guilty to wire fraud in the case;[163] in June 2018, he reached a settlement and received $7.5 million.[164]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Duncan offered to pay for airline tickets for college students in the U.S. Virgin Islands to travel home during the COVID-19 pandemic.[165]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players\n* List of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association franchise career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff rebounding leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff blocks leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff turnovers leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career playoff triple-double leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\n* List of NBA players who have spent their entire career with one franchise\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career rebounding leaders\n* List of NCAA Division I men's basketball career blocks leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tim Duncan Q&A\". slamduncan.com.
