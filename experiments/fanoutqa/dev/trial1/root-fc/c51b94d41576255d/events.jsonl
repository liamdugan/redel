For size and location reference, four very large continental landmasses are also shown.\n\n\n\n\n## Continental landmasses[edit]\n\n\nContinental landmasses are not usually classified as islands despite being completely surrounded by water.[Note 1] However, because the definition of continent varies between geographers, the Americas are sometimes defined as two separate continents while mainland Australia is sometimes defined as an island as well as a continent. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this list, mainland Australia along with the other major landmasses have been listed as continental landmasses for comparison. The figures are approximations and are for the four major continental landmasses only.[Note 2] The artificial Panama and Suez canals are disregarded, as they are not natural waters that separate the

The United States-based scientific agency considers all landmasses surrounded by ocean water, including continental mainlands, as islands. Under their definition, Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America are classified as continental mainland islands.[1]\n2. **^** Physiographically, there are only four continents (including offshore continental islands which sit on the nearby continental shelves) that are completely surrounded by water: Afro-Eurasia (57% of the global land area), the Americas (28.5%), Antarctica (9%), and Australia (5%). The remaining 0.5% is made up of remote oceanic islands, mostly scattered within Oceania in the central and south Pacific Ocean.[2]\n3. **^** Including landmasses which are above water and over 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi). The submerged continent of Zealandia (approx. 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi)) is excluded.[3]\n4. **^** Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland Africa (29,370,907 km2 (11,340,171 sq mi)) and mainland Eurasia (50,439,819 km2 (19,474,923 sq mi)).\n5. **^** Egypt has a small portion of its land located on mainland Eurasia.

For size and location reference, four very large continental landmasses are also shown.\n\n\n\n\n## Continental landmasses[edit]\n\n\nContinental landmasses are not usually classified as islands despite being completely surrounded by water.[Note 1] However, because the definition of continent varies between geographers, the Americas are sometimes defined as two separate continents while mainland Australia is sometimes defined as an island as well as a continent. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this list, mainland Australia along with the other major landmasses have been listed as continental landmasses for comparison. The figures are approximations and are for the four major continental landmasses only.[Note 2] The artificial Panama and Suez canals are disregarded, as they are not natural waters that separate the continents.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Continental landmass[Note 3] | Area\n | Nation(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (km2)\n | (sq mi) |\n| 1\n | Afro-Eurasia | 79,810,726[Note 4] | 30,815,094\n |

The United States-based scientific agency considers all landmasses surrounded by ocean water, including continental mainlands, as islands. Under their definition, Africa, Australia, Eurasia, North America, and South America are classified as continental mainland islands.[1]\n2. **^** Physiographically, there are only four continents (including offshore continental islands which sit on the nearby continental shelves) that are completely surrounded by water: Afro-Eurasia (57% of the global land area), the Americas (28.5%), Antarctica (9%), and Australia (5%). The remaining 0.5% is made up of remote oceanic islands, mostly scattered within Oceania in the central and south Pacific Ocean.[2]\n3. **^** Including landmasses which are above water and over 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi). The submerged continent of Zealandia (approx. 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi)) is excluded.[3]\n4. **^** Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland Africa (29,370,907 km2 (11,340,171 sq mi)) and mainland Eurasia (50,439,819 km2 (19,474,923 sq mi)).\n5. **^** Egypt has a small portion of its land located on mainland Eurasia. Equatorial Guinea's capital city is located on an island.\n6. **^** Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkey each have a small portion of their land located on continental Europe. Malaysia has a significant portion of its land located on an island.\n7. **^** Russia has a big portion of its land located on continental Asia. Denmark's capital city is located on an island.\n8. **^** 48 countries on mainland Africa[Note 5] and 78 countries on mainland Eurasia (38 countries on continental Asia[Note 6] and 40 countries on continental Europe[Note 7]).\n9. **^** Abkhazia and South Ossetia are both located south of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus geographically parts of Asia.\n10. **^** Two states on mainland Africa and five states on mainland Eurasia (three states on continental Asia[Note 9] and two states on continental Europe).\n11. **^** Figure derived from the Global Islands Explorer website, by adding the areas of mainland North America (20,090,075 km2 (7,756,821 sq mi)) and mainland South America (17,609,548 km2 (6,799,084 sq mi)).\n12. **^** Depending on the definition, a significant portion of Panama (land east of the Panama Canal) could be considered a part of mainland South America.\n13. **^** Ten countries on mainland North America[Note 12] and twelve countries on mainland South America.\n14. **^** An overseas department and region of France, located on mainland South America.\n15. **^** Antarctica is a special case, for if its ice is considered not as land, but as water, it is not a single landmass, but several landmasses of much smaller area, since the ice-bedrock boundary is below sea level in many regions of the continent.[4] If its ice cover were to be lifted, some rocks that are currently below sea level would rise as the weight of the ice would be removed,[5] although this would in part be counteracted, and in some areas of the continent overtaken, by eustatic rises in sea level.[6]\n16. **^** Area of mainland Antarctica, without the ice shelves and nearby islands.[7]\n17. **^** All territorial claims in Antarctica are in abeyance under the Antarctic Treaty System.\n18. **^** 7 countries have made 7 territorial claims.[Note 17]\n19. **^** Mainland Australia is more than three times the size of Greenland, the largest island.[8] Australia is sometimes dubbed \"The Island Continent\" or \"Earth's largest island, but its smallest continent\".[9]\n20. **^** Figure derived from the Geoscience Australia website, the area of mainland Tasmania (64,519 km2 (24,911 sq mi)) has been deducted.[10] The Global Islands Explorer website has given a slightly larger figure of 7,618,696 km2 (2,941,595 sq mi) for the area of mainland Australia.\n21. **^** The largest island in the world.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** A part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n23. **^** The largest island in the Eastern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The largest divided island in the world.\n24. **^** The largest island in Asia. The only island shared by three UN member states.\n25. **^** The largest island in Africa.\n26. **^** The largest island in the Arctic Archipelago.\n27. **^** The largest island in Europe.\n28. **^** The largest island in the Caribbean.\n29. **^** The largest volcanic island in the world.\n30. **^** The largest uninhabited island in the world.\n31. **^** The largest island in Antarctica.\n32. **^** Antarctic territorial claims by Argentina (partial), Chile, and the United Kingdom.\n33. **^** The largest island in South America.\n34. **^**  Antarctic territorial claims by Argentina (partial), Chile, and the United Kingdom.\n35. **^** Located at the mouth of the Amazon River, Marajó is the world's largest fluvial island.\n36. **^** Claimed by the People's Republic of China.\n37. **^** The world's largest river island and the largest island surrounded entirely by fresh water.\n38. **^** The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus claims and controls one third of the island of Cyprus although this is not recognised by any country except Turkey.\n39. ^ ***a*** ***b*** A dispute exists between the governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The disputed territory is described as \"Falkland Islands (Malvinas)\" by the United Nations.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** USGS – Global Islands Explorer\n2. **^** Stephen Hawking; Lucy Hawking (9 January 2020). \"Earth: What's It Made Of?\". *Unlocking the Universe*. p. 62.

Nuuk is the seat of government and the territory's largest cultural and economic center. The major cities from other countries closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains a third of Greenland's population and its tallest building. Nuuk is also the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2023, it had a population of 19,604.[3] Nuuk is considered a modernized city after the policy began in 1950.[4]\n\n\nThe city was founded in 1728 by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede when he relocated from the earlier Hope Colony (*Haabets Koloni*) where he arrived in 1721. The governor Claus Paarss was part of the relocation. The new colony was placed at the Inuit settlement of Nûk and was named *Godthaab* (\"Good Hope\"). \"Nuuk\" is the Greenlandic word for \"cape\" (Danish: *næs*) and is commonly found in Greenlandic place names. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°11' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. When home rule was established in 1979, the authorization of place names was transferred to Greenlandic authorities, who subsequently preferred Greenlandic names over Danish ones. The name *Godthåb* mostly went out of use over the next two decades.\n\n\nThe campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland,[5] are at the northern end of the district, near the road to Nuuk Airport.[6]\n\n\nNuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376 m (17,638 ft), the world's longest free span.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient, pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq.[9] For a long time, it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq, but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Viking explorers in the 10th century (Western Settlement), and shortly thereafter by Inuit peoples.[10] Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the Norse settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)The statue of Hans Egede in Nuuk\nThe city proper was founded as the fort of **Godt-Haab** in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony (*Haabets Koloni*) from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Norwegian colony (until 1814) under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[11] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[12] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[13] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940, when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[14]\n\n\nIn 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as **New Herrnhut** (Danish: *Nye-Hernhut*). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864),[15] before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk (Danish: *Godthåb*), c. 1878\nAround 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and was surprised at how local Greenlandic culture and identity had been suppressed under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the *Atuagagdliutt*, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became an important token of Greenlandic identity.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was a reawakening of Greenlandic national identity. The use of written Greenlandic grew, a council was assembled under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. \n\n\nUnder new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernize Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[17]\n\n\nAn article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[18] suggested,\n\n\n\n\n> One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland's population of 58,000 is Inuit, and at least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[18]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nuup Kangerlua\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLeft: Satellite view. Right: Aerial view of Nuuk\n\nNuuk is located at approximately 64°10′N 51°44′W﻿ / ﻿64.167°N 51.733°W﻿ / 64.167; -51.733[19] at the mouth of Nuup Kangerlua (formerly Baal's River[20]), some 10 km (6.2 mi) from the shores of the Labrador Sea on the southwestern coast of Greenland, and about 240 km (150 mi) south of the Arctic Circle. Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at 64°43′N 50°37′W﻿ / ﻿64.717°N 50.617°W﻿ / 64.717; -50.617, splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua.[21] The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately 64°03′N 51°58′W﻿ / ﻿64.050°N 51.967°W﻿ / 64.050; -51.967. Some 20 km (12 mi) to the northeast, reaching a height of 1,210 m (3,970 ft), Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper *Sermitsiaq*. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, 790 m (2,590 ft), and Lille Malene, 420 m (1,380 ft).[22] The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.[23][24]\n\n\n\n![View from the mountain Ukkusissaq](image)\nView from the mountain Ukkusissaq, which means \"soap stone\" (in Danish it is called Store Malene)\n\n![Panorama of Nuuk](image)\nPanorama of Nuuk\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nNuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen *ET*) with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. Although the winters in Nuuk are relatively cold, they are milder compared to other tundra climates, such as in Alaska in the United States or parts of Eastern Siberia. Instead, peak winter is similar to identical latitudes in the Nordic countries. On 21 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 am and sets at 2:20 pm. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 2:54 am and does not set until 12:04 am, giving a quasi-Midnight Sun. Nuuk can have mild temperatures on brief occasions year-round, with each month having recorded 13 °C (55 °F) or warmer, although only June, July, August, and September have recorded what could be considered hot weather (defined as 22.5 °C (72.5 °F) or higher). The monthly averages range from −9 °C (16 °F) to 7 °C (45 °F), whereas all-time extremes range from −32.5 °C (−26.5 °F) on 14 January 1984 to 26.3 °C (79.3 °F) on 6 July 2008. The record wind in Nuuk is 68 km/h.\n\n\nThe average monthly temperature (7.3 °C (45.1 °F) in August) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees (10 °C (50 °F) during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees[25] which do not sustain well.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Nuuk (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1866–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −5.0(23.0)\n | −6.0(21.2)\n | −5.1(22.8)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 6.5(43.7)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −3.0(26.6)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 4.0(39.2)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −0.9(30.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −9.7(14.5)\n | −10.9(12.4)\n | −10.0(14.0)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | −5.3(22.5)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −32.5(−26.5)\n | −29.6(−21.3)\n | −27.5(−17.5)\n | −30.0(−22.0)\n | −19.0(−2.2)\n | −10.3(13.5)\n | −6.6(20.1)\n | −4.7(23.5)\n | −8.2(17.2)\n | −16.6(2.1)\n | −24.4(−11.9)\n | −25.2(−13.4)\n | −32.5(−26.5)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67.1(2.64)\n | 51.1(2.01)\n | 58.9(2.32)\n | 53.3(2.10)\n | 57.4(2.26)\n | 61.7(2.43)\n | 69.3(2.73)\n | 90.8(3.57)\n | 104.6(4.12)\n | 80.5(3.17)\n | 79.0(3.11)\n | 74.5(2.93)\n | 852.6(33.57)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 13.8\n | 12.7\n | 15.1\n | 13.2\n | 13.0\n | 10.5\n | 12.5\n | 12.5\n | 14.1\n | 13.5\n | 14.3\n | 14.4\n | 159.6\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 13.6\n | 12.1\n | 14.5\n | 11.4\n | 9.4\n | 2.8\n | 0.1\n | 0.2\n | 4.3\n | 9.8\n | 12.7\n | 13.8\n | 104.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 73.8\n | 74.7\n | 74.3\n | 78.3\n | 81.1\n | 85.0\n | 85.3\n | 86.7\n | 82.3\n | 76.7\n | 73.3\n | 73.4\n | 78.7\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −11(12)\n | −12(10)\n | −12(10)\n | −7(19)\n | −2(28)\n | 2(36)\n | 5(41)\n | 5(41)\n | 1(34)\n | −4(25)\n | −8(18)\n | −10(14)\n | −4(24)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 15.5\n | 65.0\n | 148.8\n | 180.0\n | 189.1\n | 204.0\n | 195.3\n | 164.3\n | 141.0\n | 80.6\n | 30.0\n | 6.2\n | 1,419.8\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 0.5\n | 2.3\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 6.1\n | 6.8\n | 6.3\n | 5.3\n | 4.7\n | 2.6\n | 1.0\n | 0.2\n | 3.9\n |\n| Source 1: Danish Meteorological Institute[26][27] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows),[28] Deutscher Wetterdienst (sun 1980–1990),[29] NOAA(humidity 1991-2020), [30] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985-2015)[31] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nWith 19,604 inhabitants as of January 2023,[32] Nuuk is by far the largest town in Greenland. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country.[33] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[34] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[22]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nAs the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative center of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[22]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, the mayor of Nuuk is Charlotte Ludvigsen. She replaced former mayor Asii Chemnitz Narup in 2019 following a social media scandal involving posts criticizing her party. Like Narup, Ludvigsen is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[35]\n\n\nGreenland's self-government parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms.[36] All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women's Party.[37]\n\n\n\n### KANUKOKA[edit]\n\n\nMain article: KANUKOKA\n\nKANUKOKA (Greenlandic: *Kalaallit Nunaanni Kommunit Kattuffiat*) was based in Nuuk. It was an association of Greenland's municipalities, led by Enok Sandgreen.[38] The aim of the organisation was to facilitate cooperation among all five municipalities of Greenland: Avannaata, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Sermersooq. However, Sermersooq and Qeqertalik both withdrew and KANUKOKA was dissolved as of Tuesday, 31 July 2018.[39][40] The organisation ran the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2016. All municipal authorities in Greenland were members of the organisation up until its 2018 dissolution.[41] The association was overseen by Maliina Abelsen, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.[38][42]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The port of Nuuk\n![](image)Air Greenland headquarters in Nuuk\nAlthough only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[43] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp, but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[22] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.[44]\n\n\nThe city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[45]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nAll of Greenland's electricity is supplied by the government-owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[46] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376 m (17,638 ft), the world's longest free span.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Greenland\nNuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning. The University of Greenland (Ilisimatusarfik), the only university in Greenland, is in Nuuk. The university was founded in 1987 and expanded in 2007 with the new building, *Ilimmarfik*, housing departments of journalism, management and economics, language, literature and media, cultural and social history, theology and religion and social work. Nuuk is also home to the Department of Learning (Ilinniarfissuaq), the oldest educational facility in Greenland, in the old colonial part of Nuuk (*Nuutoqaq*: Old Nuuk). Other notable educational institutions include the Department of Nursing and Health Science, Nuuk Technical College and the Iron & Metal School.\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queen Ingrid's Health Center\nThe city is served by Queen Ingrid's Health Center. The health center serves as the regional health center for Region Sermersooq. It has an emergency room, and a central clinic with several general practitioners. Nuuk also has Queen Ingrid's Hospital which is the central hospital of Greenland.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThe Nuuk Tourist Office was built in 1992 to house the headquarters of the new National Tourist Board of Greenland.[47]\n\n\n\n### Shopping[edit]\n\n\nShops in Nuuk offer local art and craftwork. In July 2012, Greenland's first shopping center, Nuuk Center *(NC)*, opened. The center has Greenland's first underground parking. Several supermarkets exist, such as Nuuk Center, Pisiffik, Brugseni, and Spar.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk's main road Aqqusinersuaq with Hotel Hans Egede on the right\n![](image)H.J. Rinkip Aqqutaa road\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nuuk Airport\n\nNuuk has an international airport 4 km (2.5 mi) to the northeast of the town center. Built in 1979, it is a hub for Air Greenland, which is also headquartered in Nuuk[48] and operates its technical base at the airport. There are flights inside Greenland and to Iceland. A decision has been made to extend the runway to allow for flights to European destinations, such as Denmark.[49]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of the high cost of flying goods to Greenland, Nuuk and other towns in Greenland are connected to Denmark by cargo vessels which sail mainly from Aalborg during the warmer months after the winter ice has melted. They bring clothing, flour, medicine, timber and machinery and return with deep-frozen shrimp and fish.[50] For most of the year, Nuuk is served twice-weekly by the coastal ferry of the Arctic Umiaq Line, which links the communities of the western coast.[51]\n\n\n\n### Roadways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bus in Nuuk\nThe majority of buses and cars owned in Greenland operate in Nuuk.[52] There are no roads connecting Nuuk with other areas of Greenland.[53] The main street in Nuuk is Aqqusinersuaq, with a number of shops and the 140-room Hotel Hans Egede.[54]\n\n\nSince 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the Sermersooq municipality,[55] linking the town center with the airport, the outlying districts and neighborhoods[56] of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa.[57] In 2012, the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk.[58]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk Fire Station (Nuummi Qatserisartut)\n### Historical buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tuapannguit low-rise residential buildings in Nuuk\nHans Egede's House\nHans Egede's House, built in 1721 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, is the oldest building in Greenland. Standing close to the harbor among other old houses, it is now used for government receptions.[50][59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk Cathedral\nNuuk Cathedral\nThe Church of Our Saviour of the Lutheran diocese of Greenland was built in 1849, and the tower was added in 1884. The red building with a clock tower and steeple is a prominent site on the landscape.[60] The church received the status of Nuuk Cathedral in 1994, when the first bishop was Kristian Mørk, followed in 1995 by Sofie Petersen, a native of Greenland and the second woman in Denmark to become a bishop.[61]\n\n\nThe Herrnhut House was the center of the Moravian mission of New Herrnhut. Other landmarks include the Hans Egede Church and the Statue of Hans Egede.\n\n\n\nNational Museum\nGreenland National Museum is in Nuuk and was one of the first museums established in Greenland, inaugurated in the mid-1960s.[62] The museum has many artifacts and exhibits related to Greenland's archaeology, history, art, and handicrafts, and contains the Qilakitsoq mummies.\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Katuaq\n![](image)Nuuk Art Museum\nMain articles: Katuaq and Nuuk Art Museum\n\nKatuaq is a cultural center used for concerts, films, art exhibitions, and conferences. It was designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen and inaugurated on 15 February 1997. Katuaq contains two auditoria, the larger seating 1,008 people and the smaller, 508. The complex also contains an art school, library, meeting facilities, administrative offices and a café.\n\n\nThe Nuuk Art Museum is the only private art and crafts museum in Greenland.[63] The museum contains a notable collection of local paintings, watercolors, drawings, and graphics, some by Andy Warhol; and figures in soapstone, ivory, and wood, with many items collected by archaeologists.\n\n\n\n### Educational[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Greenland\n\nIlisimatusarfik, the University of Greenland, is in Nuuk and is the national university of Greenland. Most courses are taught in Danish, although a few are in Kalaallisut as well. As of 2007[update], the university had approximately 150 students (almost all Greenlanders), around 14 academic staff, and five administrators.[64] Its library holds approximately 30,000 volumes.\n\n\nThe National Library of Greenland in Nuuk is the largest reference library in the country, devoted to the preservation of Greenland's cultural heritage and history.[65] The library holdings are split between the public library in the town center and Ilimmarfik, the campus of the University of Greenland. As of 1 January 2008, there are 83,324 items in the library database at Ilimmarfik.[66]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nuuk Stadium\n\n![](image)Godthåbhallen exterior\n![](image)Teletårnet, Nuuk\nNuuk's sports clubs include Nuuk IL (established in 1934), B-67, and GSS Nuuk. Nuuk Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium, used mostly for football games. The stadium has a capacity of 2,000.[67] The stadium can also be used as an entertainment venue: the Scottish rock band Nazareth performed at the venue. Nuuk also has the Godthåbhallen, a handball stadium. It is the home of the Greenland men's national handball team and has a capacity of 1,000.[67] There is a hill for alpine skiing with an altitude difference around 300 meters on the mountain Lille Malene,[68] with the valley station close to the airport terminal.[69] There is also the Nuuk golf course, the only arctic golf course in the world.[70]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Maliina Abelsen, Greenland's Minister for Social Affairs\n* Bibi Chemnitz (born 1983), fashion designer\n* Agnethe Davidsen, Greenland's first female government minister\n* Jesper Grønkjær, footballer\n* Bo Lidegaard, historian\n* Nils Nielsen, Football manager.

Nuuk is the seat of government and the territory's largest cultural and economic center. The major cities from other countries closest to the capital are Iqaluit and St. John's in Canada and Reykjavík in Iceland. Nuuk contains a third of Greenland's population and its tallest building. Nuuk is also the seat of government for the Sermersooq municipality. In January 2023, it had a population of 19,604.[3] Nuuk is considered a modernized city after the policy began in 1950.[4]\n\n\nThe city was founded in 1728 by the Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede when he relocated from the earlier Hope Colony (*Haabets Koloni*) where he arrived in 1721. The governor Claus Paarss was part of the relocation. The new colony was placed at the Inuit settlement of Nûk and was named *Godthaab* (\"Good Hope\"). \"Nuuk\" is the Greenlandic word for \"cape\" (Danish: *næs*) and is commonly found in Greenlandic place names. It is so named because of its position at the end of the Nuup Kangerlua fjord on the eastern shore of the Labrador Sea. Its latitude, at 64°11' N, makes it the world's northernmost capital, only a few kilometres farther north than the Icelandic capital Reykjavík. When home rule was established in 1979, the authorization of place names was transferred to Greenlandic authorities, who subsequently preferred Greenlandic names over Danish ones. The name *Godthåb* mostly went out of use over the next two decades.\n\n\nThe campus of the University of Greenland, hosting Statistics Greenland and the main holdings of the Public and National Library of Greenland,[5] are at the northern end of the district, near the road to Nuuk Airport.[6]\n\n\nNuuk receives its electric power mainly from the renewable energy-powered Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376 m (17,638 ft), the world's longest free span.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe site has a long history of habitation. The area around Nuuk was first occupied by the ancient, pre-Inuit, Paleo-Eskimo people of the Saqqaq culture as far back as 2200 BC when they lived in the area around the now abandoned settlement of Qoornoq.[9] For a long time, it was occupied by the Dorset culture around the former settlement of Kangeq, but they disappeared from the Nuuk district before AD 1000. The Nuuk area was later inhabited by Viking explorers in the 10th century (Western Settlement), and shortly thereafter by Inuit peoples.[10] Inuit and Norsemen both lived with little interaction in this area from about 1000 until the disappearance of the Norse settlement for uncertain reasons during the 15th century.\n\n\n\n![](image)The statue of Hans Egede in Nuuk\nThe city proper was founded as the fort of **Godt-Haab** in 1728 by the royal governor Claus Paarss, when he relocated the missionary and merchant Hans Egede's earlier Hope Colony (*Haabets Koloni*) from Kangeq Island to the mainland. At that time, Greenland was formally still a Norwegian colony (until 1814) under the united Dano-Norwegian Crown, but the colony had not had any contact for over three centuries. Paarss's colonists consisted of mutinous soldiers, convicts, and prostitutes and most died within the first year of scurvy and other ailments. In 1733 and 1734, a smallpox epidemic killed most of the native population as well as Egede's wife.[11] Hans Egede went back to Denmark in 1736 after 15 years in Greenland, leaving his son Poul to continue his work.[12] Godthaab became the seat of government for the Danish colony of South Greenland,[13] while Godhavn (modern Qeqertarsuaq) was the capital of North Greenland until 1940, when the administration was unified in Godthaab.[14]\n\n\nIn 1733, Moravian missionaries received permission to begin a mission on the island; in 1747, there were enough converts to prompt the construction of the Moravian Brethren Mission House and the formal establishment of the mission as **New Herrnhut** (Danish: *Nye-Hernhut*). This became the nucleus for present-day Nuuk as many Greenlanders from the southeastern coast left their territory to live at the mission station. From this base, further missions were established at Lichtenfels (1748), Lichtenau (1774), Friedrichsthal (1824), Umanak (1861), and Idlorpait (1864),[15] before they were discontinued in 1900 and folded into the Lutheran Church of Denmark.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk (Danish: *Godthåb*), c. 1878\nAround 1850, Greenland, and especially the area around Nuuk, were in crisis. The Europeans had brought diseases and a culture that conflicted with the ways of the native Greenlanders. Many Greenlanders were living in poverty. In 1853, Hinrich Johannes Rink came to Greenland and was surprised at how local Greenlandic culture and identity had been suppressed under Danish influence. In response, in 1861, he started the *Atuagagdliutt*, Greenland's first newspaper, with a native Greenlander as editor. This newspaper based in Nuuk later became an important token of Greenlandic identity.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was a reawakening of Greenlandic national identity. The use of written Greenlandic grew, a council was assembled under Eske Brun's leadership in Nuuk. In 1940, an American and a Canadian Consulate were established in Nuuk. \n\n\nUnder new regulations in 1950, two councils amalgamated into one. This Countryside Council was abolished on 1 May 1979, when the city of Godthåb was renamed Nuuk by the Greenland Home Rule government. The city boomed during the 1950s when Denmark began to modernize Greenland. As in Greenland as a whole, Nuuk is populated today by both Inuit and Danes. Over a third of Greenland's total population lives in the Nuuk Greater Metropolitan area.[17]\n\n\nAn article examining indigenous influences on cities worldwide[18] suggested,\n\n\n\n\n> One city... stands out. Nuuk... has probably the highest percentage of aboriginal people of any city: almost 90% of Greenland's population of 58,000 is Inuit, and at least eight in 10 live in urban settlements. Nuuk also celebrates Inuit culture and history to an extent that is unprecedented in many cities with higher total aboriginal populations. By proportion and by cultural authority and impact, it may well be tiny Nuuk that is the most indigenous city in the world.[18]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nuup Kangerlua\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLeft: Satellite view. Right: Aerial view of Nuuk\n\nNuuk is located at approximately 64°10′N 51°44′W﻿ / ﻿64.167°N 51.733°W﻿ / 64.167; -51.733[19] at the mouth of Nuup Kangerlua (formerly Baal's River[20]), some 10 km (6.2 mi) from the shores of the Labrador Sea on the southwestern coast of Greenland, and about 240 km (150 mi) south of the Arctic Circle. Initially, the fjord flows to the northwest, to then turn southwest at 64°43′N 50°37′W﻿ / ﻿64.717°N 50.617°W﻿ / 64.717; -50.617, splitting into three arms in its lower run, with three big islands in between the arms: Sermitsiaq Island, Qeqertarsuaq Island, and Qoornuup Qeqertarsua.[21] The fjord widens into a bay dotted with skerries near its mouth, opening into Labrador Sea at approximately 64°03′N 51°58′W﻿ / ﻿64.050°N 51.967°W﻿ / 64.050; -51.967. Some 20 km (12 mi) to the northeast, reaching a height of 1,210 m (3,970 ft), Sermitsiaq can be seen from almost everywhere in Nuuk. The mountain has given its name to the nationwide newspaper *Sermitsiaq*. Closer to the town are the peaks of Store Malene, 790 m (2,590 ft), and Lille Malene, 420 m (1,380 ft).[22] The magnetic declination at Nuuk is extreme.[23][24]\n\n\n\n![View from the mountain Ukkusissaq](image)\nView from the mountain Ukkusissaq, which means \"soap stone\" (in Danish it is called Store Malene)\n\n![Panorama of Nuuk](image)\nPanorama of Nuuk\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nNuuk has a maritime-influenced tundra climate (Köppen *ET*) with cold, long, snowy winters and cool, short summers. Although the winters in Nuuk are relatively cold, they are milder compared to other tundra climates, such as in Alaska in the United States or parts of Eastern Siberia. Instead, peak winter is similar to identical latitudes in the Nordic countries. On 21 December, the shortest day and longest night of the year, the sun rises at 10:30 am and sets at 2:20 pm. By contrast, on the longest day and shortest night of the year, 21 June, the sun rises at 2:54 am and does not set until 12:04 am, giving a quasi-Midnight Sun. Nuuk can have mild temperatures on brief occasions year-round, with each month having recorded 13 °C (55 °F) or warmer, although only June, July, August, and September have recorded what could be considered hot weather (defined as 22.5 °C (72.5 °F) or higher). The monthly averages range from −9 °C (16 °F) to 7 °C (45 °F), whereas all-time extremes range from −32.5 °C (−26.5 °F) on 14 January 1984 to 26.3 °C (79.3 °F) on 6 July 2008. The record wind in Nuuk is 68 km/h.\n\n\nThe average monthly temperature (7.3 °C (45.1 °F) in August) is colder than what is considered the limit for trees (10 °C (50 °F) during the warmest month). There are a few planted trees[25] which do not sustain well.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Nuuk (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1866–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −5.0(23.0)\n | −6.0(21.2)\n | −5.1(22.8)\n | −0.7(30.7)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 6.5(43.7)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 1.8(35.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −3.0(26.6)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 4.0(39.2)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n | −5.5(22.1)\n | −0.9(30.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −9.7(14.5)\n | −10.9(12.4)\n | −10.0(14.0)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −1.2(29.8)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 4.5(40.1)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | −1.8(28.8)\n | −5.3(22.5)\n | −7.7(18.1)\n | −3.3(26.1)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −32.5(−26.5)\n | −29.6(−21.3)\n | −27.5(−17.5)\n | −30.0(−22.0)\n | −19.0(−2.2)\n | −10.3(13.5)\n | −6.6(20.1)\n | −4.7(23.5)\n | −8.2(17.2)\n | −16.6(2.1)\n | −24.4(−11.9)\n | −25.2(−13.4)\n | −32.5(−26.5)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67.1(2.64)\n | 51.1(2.01)\n | 58.9(2.32)\n | 53.3(2.10)\n | 57.4(2.26)\n | 61.7(2.43)\n | 69.3(2.73)\n | 90.8(3.57)\n | 104.6(4.12)\n | 80.5(3.17)\n | 79.0(3.11)\n | 74.5(2.93)\n | 852.6(33.57)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 13.8\n | 12.7\n | 15.1\n | 13.2\n | 13.0\n | 10.5\n | 12.5\n | 12.5\n | 14.1\n | 13.5\n | 14.3\n | 14.4\n | 159.6\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 13.6\n | 12.1\n | 14.5\n | 11.4\n | 9.4\n | 2.8\n | 0.1\n | 0.2\n | 4.3\n | 9.8\n | 12.7\n | 13.8\n | 104.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 73.8\n | 74.7\n | 74.3\n | 78.3\n | 81.1\n | 85.0\n | 85.3\n | 86.7\n | 82.3\n | 76.7\n | 73.3\n | 73.4\n | 78.7\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −11(12)\n | −12(10)\n | −12(10)\n | −7(19)\n | −2(28)\n | 2(36)\n | 5(41)\n | 5(41)\n | 1(34)\n | −4(25)\n | −8(18)\n | −10(14)\n | −4(24)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 15.5\n | 65.0\n | 148.8\n | 180.0\n | 189.1\n | 204.0\n | 195.3\n | 164.3\n | 141.0\n | 80.6\n | 30.0\n | 6.2\n | 1,419.8\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 0.5\n | 2.3\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 6.1\n | 6.8\n | 6.3\n | 5.3\n | 4.7\n | 2.6\n | 1.0\n | 0.2\n | 3.9\n |\n| Source 1: Danish Meteorological Institute[26][27] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows),[28] Deutscher Wetterdienst (sun 1980–1990),[29] NOAA(humidity 1991-2020), [30] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985-2015)[31] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nWith 19,604 inhabitants as of January 2023,[32] Nuuk is by far the largest town in Greenland. The population of Nuuk has doubled since 1977, increased by over a third since 1990, and risen by almost 21% since 2000. In addition to those born in Greenland, data from 2015 showed 3,826 were born outside the country.[33] Attracted by good employment opportunities with high wages, Danes have continued to settle in the town. Today, Nuuk has the highest proportion of Danes of any town in Greenland.[34] Half of Greenland's immigrants live in Nuuk, which also accounts for a quarter of the country's native population.[22]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nAs the capital of Greenland, Nuuk is the administrative center of the country, containing all of the important government buildings and institutions. The public sector bodies are also the town's largest employer.[22]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, the mayor of Nuuk is Charlotte Ludvigsen. She replaced former mayor Asii Chemnitz Narup in 2019 following a social media scandal involving posts criticizing her party. Like Narup, Ludvigsen is a member of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[35]\n\n\nGreenland's self-government parliament, the Inatsisartut, is in Nuuk. It has 31 seats and its members are elected by popular vote on the basis of proportional representation to serve four-year terms.[36] All of Greenland's major political parties have their headquarters in Nuuk, including the Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut, Democrats, Atassut, Association of Candidates and the Women's Party.[37]\n\n\n\n### KANUKOKA[edit]\n\n\nMain article: KANUKOKA\n\nKANUKOKA (Greenlandic: *Kalaallit Nunaanni Kommunit Kattuffiat*) was based in Nuuk. It was an association of Greenland's municipalities, led by Enok Sandgreen.[38] The aim of the organisation was to facilitate cooperation among all five municipalities of Greenland: Avannaata, Kujalleq, Qeqertalik, Qeqqata, and Sermersooq. However, Sermersooq and Qeqertalik both withdrew and KANUKOKA was dissolved as of Tuesday, 31 July 2018.[39][40] The organisation ran the municipal elections every four years, with the last election taking place in 2016. All municipal authorities in Greenland were members of the organisation up until its 2018 dissolution.[41] The association was overseen by Maliina Abelsen, the Minister for Social Affairs in the Government of Greenland.[38][42]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The port of Nuuk\n![](image)Air Greenland headquarters in Nuuk\nAlthough only a small town, Nuuk has developed trade, business, shipping and other industries. It began as a small fishing settlement with a harbor, but as the economy developed rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s, the fishing industry in the capital declined.[43] The port is nevertheless still home to almost half of Greenland's fishing fleet. The local Royal Greenland processing plant absorbs landed seafood amounting to over DKK 50 million (US$7 million) per annum, mainly (80%) shrimp, but also cod, lumpfish and halibut.[22] Seafood, including seal, is also sold in abundance in Nuuk's fish markets, the largest being Kalaaliaraq Market. Minerals including zinc and gold have contributed to the development of Nuuk's economy.[44]\n\n\nThe city, like much of Greenland, is heavily dependent upon Danish investment and relies on Denmark for block funding.[45]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nAll of Greenland's electricity is supplied by the government-owned company Nukissiorfiit, which has a monopoly on the electricity in Greenland.[46] Since 1993, Nuuk has received its electric power mainly from Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant by way of a 132 kV powerline crossing Ameralik fjord over a distance of 5,376 m (17,638 ft), the world's longest free span.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Greenland\nNuuk has several educational institutions of higher learning. The University of Greenland (Ilisimatusarfik), the only university in Greenland, is in Nuuk. The university was founded in 1987 and expanded in 2007 with the new building, *Ilimmarfik*, housing departments of journalism, management and economics, language, literature and media, cultural and social history, theology and religion and social work. Nuuk is also home to the Department of Learning (Ilinniarfissuaq), the oldest educational facility in Greenland, in the old colonial part of Nuuk (*Nuutoqaq*: Old Nuuk). Other notable educational institutions include the Department of Nursing and Health Science, Nuuk Technical College and the Iron & Metal School.\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queen Ingrid's Health Center\nThe city is served by Queen Ingrid's Health Center. The health center serves as the regional health center for Region Sermersooq. It has an emergency room, and a central clinic with several general practitioners. Nuuk also has Queen Ingrid's Hospital which is the central hospital of Greenland.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nThe Nuuk Tourist Office was built in 1992 to house the headquarters of the new National Tourist Board of Greenland.[47]\n\n\n\n### Shopping[edit]\n\n\nShops in Nuuk offer local art and craftwork. In July 2012, Greenland's first shopping center, Nuuk Center *(NC)*, opened. The center has Greenland's first underground parking. Several supermarkets exist, such as Nuuk Center, Pisiffik, Brugseni, and Spar.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk's main road Aqqusinersuaq with Hotel Hans Egede on the right\n![](image)H.J. Rinkip Aqqutaa road\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nuuk Airport\n\nNuuk has an international airport 4 km (2.5 mi) to the northeast of the town center. Built in 1979, it is a hub for Air Greenland, which is also headquartered in Nuuk[48] and operates its technical base at the airport. There are flights inside Greenland and to Iceland. A decision has been made to extend the runway to allow for flights to European destinations, such as Denmark.[49]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of the high cost of flying goods to Greenland, Nuuk and other towns in Greenland are connected to Denmark by cargo vessels which sail mainly from Aalborg during the warmer months after the winter ice has melted. They bring clothing, flour, medicine, timber and machinery and return with deep-frozen shrimp and fish.[50] For most of the year, Nuuk is served twice-weekly by the coastal ferry of the Arctic Umiaq Line, which links the communities of the western coast.[51]\n\n\n\n### Roadways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bus in Nuuk\nThe majority of buses and cars owned in Greenland operate in Nuuk.[52] There are no roads connecting Nuuk with other areas of Greenland.[53] The main street in Nuuk is Aqqusinersuaq, with a number of shops and the 140-room Hotel Hans Egede.[54]\n\n\nSince 2009, the city bus service Nuup Bussii provides city transport services in Nuuk for the Sermersooq municipality,[55] linking the town center with the airport, the outlying districts and neighborhoods[56] of Nuussuaq, Qinngorput, as well as Qernertunnguit in Quassussuup Tungaa.[57] In 2012, the buses transported more than 2 million passengers around the city of Nuuk.[58]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk Fire Station (Nuummi Qatserisartut)\n### Historical buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tuapannguit low-rise residential buildings in Nuuk\nHans Egede's House\nHans Egede's House, built in 1721 by the Norwegian missionary Hans Egede, is the oldest building in Greenland. Standing close to the harbor among other old houses, it is now used for government receptions.[50][59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nuuk Cathedral\nNuuk Cathedral\nThe Church of Our Saviour of the Lutheran diocese of Greenland was built in 1849, and the tower was added in 1884. The red building with a clock tower and steeple is a prominent site on the landscape.[60] The church received the status of Nuuk Cathedral in 1994, when the first bishop was Kristian Mørk, followed in 1995 by Sofie Petersen, a native of Greenland and the second woman in Denmark to become a bishop.[61]\n\n\nThe Herrnhut House was the center of the Moravian mission of New Herrnhut. Other landmarks include the Hans Egede Church and the Statue of Hans Egede.\n\n\n\nNational Museum\nGreenland National Museum is in Nuuk and was one of the first museums established in Greenland, inaugurated in the mid-1960s.[62] The museum has many artifacts and exhibits related to Greenland's archaeology, history, art, and handicrafts, and contains the Qilakitsoq mummies.\n\n\n\n### Cultural[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Katuaq\n![](image)Nuuk Art Museum\nMain articles: Katuaq and Nuuk Art Museum\n\nKatuaq is a cultural center used for concerts, films, art exhibitions, and conferences. It was designed by Schmidt Hammer Lassen and inaugurated on 15 February 1997. Katuaq contains two auditoria, the larger seating 1,008 people and the smaller, 508. The complex also contains an art school, library, meeting facilities, administrative offices and a café.\n\n\nThe Nuuk Art Museum is the only private art and crafts museum in Greenland.[63] The museum contains a notable collection of local paintings, watercolors, drawings, and graphics, some by Andy Warhol; and figures in soapstone, ivory, and wood, with many items collected by archaeologists.\n\n\n\n### Educational[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Greenland\n\nIlisimatusarfik, the University of Greenland, is in Nuuk and is the national university of Greenland. Most courses are taught in Danish, although a few are in Kalaallisut as well. As of 2007[update], the university had approximately 150 students (almost all Greenlanders), around 14 academic staff, and five administrators.[64] Its library holds approximately 30,000 volumes.\n\n\nThe National Library of Greenland in Nuuk is the largest reference library in the country, devoted to the preservation of Greenland's cultural heritage and history.[65] The library holdings are split between the public library in the town center and Ilimmarfik, the campus of the University of Greenland. As of 1 January 2008, there are 83,324 items in the library database at Ilimmarfik.[66]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nuuk Stadium\n\n![](image)Godthåbhallen exterior\n![](image)Teletårnet, Nuuk\nNuuk's sports clubs include Nuuk IL (established in 1934), B-67, and GSS Nuuk. Nuuk Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium, used mostly for football games. The stadium has a capacity of 2,000.[67] The stadium can also be used as an entertainment venue: the Scottish rock band Nazareth performed at the venue. Nuuk also has the Godthåbhallen, a handball stadium. It is the home of the Greenland men's national handball team and has a capacity of 1,000.[67] There is a hill for alpine skiing with an altitude difference around 300 meters on the mountain Lille Malene,[68] with the valley station close to the airport terminal.[69] There is also the Nuuk golf course, the only arctic golf course in the world.[70]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Maliina Abelsen, Greenland's Minister for Social Affairs\n* Bibi Chemnitz (born 1983), fashion designer\n* Agnethe Davidsen, Greenland's first female government minister\n* Jesper Grønkjær, footballer\n* Bo Lidegaard, historian\n* Nils Nielsen, Football manager.

It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern Pacific (along with Jayapura) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942–43 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas.\n\n\nAs of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000.[2] The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.\n\n\nAlthough Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.\n\n\nPort Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018.[3] However, there were concerns about security given the capital's reputation for violent crime.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hiri expedition arriving in Port Moresby in the 1990s\n### Before colonisation[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.[4] There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called *iduhu*, which are somewhat similar to clans.[4]\n\n\n\n### Colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queensland raises the British flag at Port Moresby in 1883\n![](image)Government House in Port Moresby—still used today though substantially enlarged—at the beginning of the 20th century\nIn 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.[5] British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.\n\n\nIn 1905, the recently federated Australian government passed the Papua Act which came into effect in 1906. The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved. The first butcher's shop and grocery opened in 1909,[6] electricity was introduced in 1925,[7] and piped water supply was provided in 1941.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Douglas Street, Port Moresby: Old hotel lot, vacant for 30 years, and new building behind it.\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War II, some Papuan men enlisted in the Papua Infantry Battalion and others as carriers over trails and rough terrains (porters) as supply support to Allied and Japanese armies during long jungle marches.[9] Historian William Manchester outlines in his biography of General Douglas MacArthur, *American Caesar*, that acting as porters was well down the natives' list of acceptable voluntary activities and that they would fade away without great inducements.[10] Many Papuan residents of Port Moresby either returned to their family villages or were evacuated to camps when the threat of Japanese invasion loomed. By September 1942, the city was an important Allied complex of bases, and thousands of troops were stationed in the area or more often, staged through it, as it was the last Allied bastion on the island[11][12] and, conversely, a key staging and jumping off point as the Allies began conducting offensive warfare themselves, pushing back the Japanese advances.[13] General MacArthur located his headquarters in Port Moresby from November 1942 to October 1944.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)The longstanding downtown United Church with next door office building in 2013 were replaced with one building, the church on the ground floor.\n![](image)Downtown\nIn 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with Oala Oala-Rarua becoming the first Lord Mayor.[14]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations.[15] New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.[15]\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\n\n\nSeveral of the government buildings have been abandoned due to long-term neglect. Chief amongst these are Marea Haus (known to most locals as the \"Pineapple Building\") and the Central Government Offices.[*citation needed*] However, widespread restoration rather than demolition of long-disused office buildings has been highly active since the first decade of the 21st century.[*citation needed*] The legislative building before independence and the first parliament building is long-gone but the old court house in town Port Moresby remains, bearing its pre-independence label with its previous title.\n\n\nThe population of the Port Moresby area expanded rapidly after independence. In 1980, the census return registered a population of 120,000; by 1990, this had increased to 195,000.[16]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMoresby has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: *Aw*) with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Port Moresby's average yearly rainfall is less than 900 mm, making it the driest place in New Guinea.\n\n\nThe wet season starts in December and ends in May; the dry season covers the remaining six months. This is due to the south easterly trade winds running parallel to the coast, and the city being surrounded by high mountains. The average high temperatures range from 28 to 32 °C (82.4 to 89.6 °F) depending on time of year, while the average low temperature shows very little seasonal variation, hovering around the 23 °C (73.4 °F) mark. It tends to be slightly cooler in the city during the dry season.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 36.2(97.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 35.4(95.7)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n | 32.4(90.3)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 27.6(81.7)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 14.4(57.9)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 192.2(7.57)\n | 140.6(5.54)\n | 189.8(7.47)\n | 105.2(4.14)\n | 56.2(2.21)\n | 21.6(0.85)\n | 13.8(0.54)\n | 12.0(0.47)\n | 14.4(0.57)\n | 15.2(0.60)\n | 40.0(1.57)\n | 97.8(3.85)\n | 898.8(35.38)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 18\n | 16\n | 18\n | 11\n | 9\n | 6\n | 4\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | 6\n | 12\n | 114\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 81\n | 81\n | 82\n | 81\n | 79\n | 77\n | 76\n | 76\n | 76\n | 75\n | 77\n | 78\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 182\n | 158\n | 184\n | 200\n | 211\n | 200\n | 203\n | 222\n | 213\n | 231\n | 243\n | 216\n | 2,463\n |\n| Source 1: World Meteorological Organization[17] |\n| Source 2: Deutscher Wetterdienst (extremes, mean temperature, humidity and sun)[18][19][a] |\n\n## District, LLGs and suburbs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Port Moresby suburbs\n\n![](image)Urban sustainability analysis of the greater urban area of the city, using the Circles of Sustainability method of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme.\n![](image)Walter Bay from hills immediately east of downtown Port Moresby\n![](image)Ela Beach\n![](image)Coastal housing at Hanuabada in Port Moresby\nPort Moresby is the single district of the National Capital District, which contains three Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n| District | District Capital | LLG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| National Capital District | Port Moresby\n | Moresby North-East |\n| Moresby North-West |\n| Moresby South |\n\n\nThe National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the Motu Koita Assembly, established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPort Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as \"Town\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince the 1990s the original town centre has ceased to have restaurants and night life, though it is very successful and prosperous-looking as an office centre. The affluent housing region north of downtown along and up from the coast remains so, though there are now few modest residential houses, most of which are replaced with substantial mansions and apartment buildings.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe suburb of Boroko, once the commercial heart of Port Moresby, is very idle, with many former shopping buildings now[*when?*] empty; the west is full of high rises, shopping centres and affluent housing. Other neighbourhoods of Port Moresby include Koki, with its popular fresh produce market, Newtown, Konedobu, Kaevaga, Badili, Gabutu, Kila Kila, Matirogo, Three Mile, Kaugere, Sabama, Korobosea, Four Mile, Hohola, Hohola North, Boroko, Gordons, Gordons North, Erima, Saraga, Waigani, Morata and Gerehu.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Villages[edit]\n\n\nVillages within Port Moresby include:\n\n\n\n* Hanuabada, which offers a safe haven for LGBT people in PNG[21]\n* Kira Kira village[22] (sometimes spelt Kirakira[23]), the home town of Australian footballer Mary Fowler's mother\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Papua New Guinea\n\n*Al Jazeera* describes Port Moresby as \"one of the most dangerous cities in the world\".[24] *ABC Australia* reports that \"many homes have big fences covered in metal sheeting, locked gates and internal steel security doors.\"[25]\nTravel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due to continuing breakdown in law and order. The UN Global Compact Cities Programme, using a method called Circles of Sustainability, has assessed the urban security of Port Moresby as 'critical'.[26]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jacksons International Airport, looking east across the airstrip.\nPort Moresby is served within the city by buses and privately owned taxis. Flights are vital for transport about the country, highways not being widely available. Port Moresby is served by Jacksons International Airport, the biggest international airport and Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Wing base in the country.\n\n\nAs the national highway system is not fully linked, there are many internal flights to other towns, such as Lae and Madang, which have no direct road connection to Port Moresby.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Port Moresby, seen from the International Space Station\nPapua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.[27] The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting,[28] brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\n\n\nThere has been substantial building of housing, office towers, shopping malls and commercial establishments over much of the city.[*citation needed*] The waterfront area has been completely redeveloped with apartments, restaurants and shopping centres. Sporting facilities were upgraded significantly for the 2015 South Pacific Games, and further development took place in preparation for the 2016 FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup.[29]\n\n\nAir Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea, and Airlines PNG, the second biggest airline in the country, have their head offices on the grounds of Jacksons International Airport.[30]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 1969 South Pacific Games, held from 13 to 23 August 1969 at Port Moresby, were the third South Pacific Games to be held. A total of 1,150 athletes participated.[31]\n\n\nThe 1991 South Pacific Games held from 7–21 September 1991 at Port Moresby and along Lae were the ninth South Pacific Games to be held. This was the first time that events at one games had been held in two cities. The decision to do so was to allow both locations to benefit from the construction of new facilities.[32]\n\n\nCricket PNG is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters is in Port Moresby. Cricket PNG is Papua New Guinea's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 1973. It is also a member of the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council.[33][34]\n\n\nThe city hosted the 2017 FIBA Melanesia Basketball Cup, where the Papua New Guinea national basketball team won the gold medal.\n\n\nThe city is home to the Port Moresby Vipers rugby league team who play in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League. The National football stadium is also home to the PNG Hunters, a rugby league team that compete in the majority Australian Queensland Cup.\n\n\n\n### 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby[edit]\n\n\nThe 2015 Pacific Games was held in Port Moresby from 4 to 18 July 2015.[35] In September 2009, the Pacific Games Council, at its meeting coinciding with the 2009 Pacific Mini Games, elected Port Moresby as the host of the 2015 Games. The final vote was 25–22 in favour of Port Moresby over Tonga to host.[36]\n\n\nThe 2015 Pacific Games involved 24 countries from the Pacific regions competing in 28 sports events, including: basketball, soccer, touch rugby, table tennis, weightlifting, triathlon, swimming, cricket, squash, shooting, sailing, va'a, rugby 7s, powerlifting, rugby league 9s, volleyball, beach volleyball, athletics, hockey, netball, karate, lawn bowls, bodybuilding, boxing, softball, taekwondo, golf, and canoeing. Papua New Guinea ranked first with the most medals followed by New Caledonia and Tahiti.[37]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on the 4th of July 2015 involving various traditional dances.[38] The closing ceremony involved singers such as J Boog, Fiji, O-Shen and George Mamua Telek.[39]\n\n\n\n### Sports venues[edit]\n\n\n* Sir John Guise Stadium is the premier sports venue with a capacity of 15,000. It was completely rebuilt in 2015.\n* Amini Park is a cricket ground in Port Moresby.[40][41] The ground is named for the Amini family, several of whom have played cricket for Papua New Guinea (both the men's and women's teams),[42] the ground has seen the men's team play Australia, the West Indies and Victoria. The women's team played Japan in a three match series at the ground in September 2006.[43]\n* Lloyd Robson Oval is a sporting ground in Port Moresby and has hosted 3 games for the 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup. It has been the home ground for the Papua New Guinea national rugby league team since 1975 and the Port Moresby Vipers. It has a total capacity of approximately 17,000.\n* National Football Stadium – Papua New Guinea's National Football Stadium, formerly known as Lloyd Robson Oval, is located in Port Moresby and hosted three matches for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. The venue (Loyd Robson Oval) was completely redeveloped in 2015 and has an all-seated capacity of 15,000. This was completed in time for the Pacific Games. [44]\n\n\nThe venue has hosted the PNG national side since 1975 and has previously hosted Rugby League World Cup matches in 1986 and 1990. It is also home of the Hunters, the local Papua New Guinea team who play in the Intrust Super Cup which is the Queensland NRL tournament.\nThe National Football Stadium features a permanent main grandstand with seating for 3,000 including a roof and corporate facilities while temporary stands around the ground boost the seating capacity. There are also lights and a video screen.\n\n\n\n* PMRL Stadium is a football stadium in Port Moresby and it is used mainly for football and hosts the home matches of PRK Hekari United of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League and OFC Champions League. The stadium has a seating capacity of 15,000 spectators.[45]\n* Hubert Murray Stadium is a sports venue located in Port Moresby and was developed for the 1969 South Pacific Games on reclaimed land at Konedobu that had previously been shoreline mangroves.[31] The athletics events and the opening and closing ceremonies were held at the new stadium,[46] which was named after Sir Hubert Murray, a former lieutenant governor.[47] In 2015–16 it was completely rebuilt as a large capacity football ground.\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### International schools[edit]\n\n\nThe International Education Agency provides private education via six international schools; Korobosea International School, Boroko International School, Ela Murray International School, Gordon International School, Port Moresby International School and IEA TAFE college.

It is one of the largest cities in the southwestern Pacific (along with Jayapura) outside of Australia and New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Gulf of Papua, on the south-western coast of the Papuan Peninsula of the island of New Guinea. The city emerged as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century. During World War II, it was a prime objective for conquest by the Imperial Japanese forces during 1942–43 as a staging point and air base to cut off Australia from Southeast Asia and the Americas.\n\n\nAs of the 2011 census, Port Moresby had 364,145 inhabitants. An unofficial 2020 estimate gives the population as 383,000.[2] The place where the city was founded has been inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu people for centuries. The first Briton to see it was Royal Navy Captain John Moresby in 1873. It was named in honour of his father, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Fairfax Moresby.\n\n\nAlthough Port Moresby is surrounded by Central Province, of which it is also the capital, it is not part of that province but forms the National Capital District. The traditional landowners, the Motu and Koitabu people, are represented by the Motu Koita Assembly.\n\n\nPort Moresby hosted the APEC summit in November 2018.[3] However, there were concerns about security given the capital's reputation for violent crime.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Hiri expedition arriving in Port Moresby in the 1990s\n### Before colonisation[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans to the region, it was inhabited by the Motu-Koitabu. The Motu were originally coastal dwellers, while the Koitabu lived more inland.[4] There was significant intermarriage between these two groups. They were organized into units called *iduhu*, which are somewhat similar to clans.[4]\n\n\n\n### Colonisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Queensland raises the British flag at Port Moresby in 1883\n![](image)Government House in Port Moresby—still used today though substantially enlarged—at the beginning of the 20th century\nIn 1883, Queensland attempted to annex the south-eastern corner of the New Guinea Island (subsequently known as Papua), fearing that Germany would take control of the entire eastern half of the island.[5] British authorities refused to approve the annexation following the German annexation of New Guinea in 1884, but four years later it established a protectorate over Papua as British New Guinea.\n\n\nIn 1905, the recently federated Australian government passed the Papua Act which came into effect in 1906. The act transferred Papua, with Port Moresby as its capital, to direct Australian rule. From then until 1941 Port Moresby grew slowly. The main growth was on the peninsula, where port facilities and other services were gradually improved. The first butcher's shop and grocery opened in 1909,[6] electricity was introduced in 1925,[7] and piped water supply was provided in 1941.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Douglas Street, Port Moresby: Old hotel lot, vacant for 30 years, and new building behind it.\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War II, some Papuan men enlisted in the Papua Infantry Battalion and others as carriers over trails and rough terrains (porters) as supply support to Allied and Japanese armies during long jungle marches.[9] Historian William Manchester outlines in his biography of General Douglas MacArthur, *American Caesar*, that acting as porters was well down the natives' list of acceptable voluntary activities and that they would fade away without great inducements.[10] Many Papuan residents of Port Moresby either returned to their family villages or were evacuated to camps when the threat of Japanese invasion loomed. By September 1942, the city was an important Allied complex of bases, and thousands of troops were stationed in the area or more often, staged through it, as it was the last Allied bastion on the island[11][12] and, conversely, a key staging and jumping off point as the Allies began conducting offensive warfare themselves, pushing back the Japanese advances.[13] General MacArthur located his headquarters in Port Moresby from November 1942 to October 1944.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)The longstanding downtown United Church with next door office building in 2013 were replaced with one building, the church on the ground floor.\n![](image)Downtown\nIn 1945, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was formed when Papua and the former German New Guinea, which had been administered by Australia since 1918, were amalgamated under a single Australian administration though several laws remained in two territories and remain so, which can be complicating with provinces sitting on two sides of the otherwise extinct boundary. Port Moresby became the capital of the new combined territory and a focal point for the expansion of public services. Port Moresby was granted city status in 1972, with Oala Oala-Rarua becoming the first Lord Mayor.[14]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent country with Port Moresby as its capital city. Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, represented the Queen of Papua New Guinea at the celebrations.[15] New government, intellectual and cultural buildings were constructed in the suburb of Waigani to supplement and replace those of downtown Port Moresby. They included those for government departments, including a National Parliament Building, which was opened in 1984 by Prince Charles and blends traditional design with modern building technology.[15]\n\n\nThe Papua New Guinea National Museum and National Library are in Waigani. A mansion was built in Port Moresby just west of the old legislative building but the last pre-independence chief minister and first prime minister of the sovereign state declared it not nearly grand enough; it was made the residence of Australian high commissioners and a mansion suitable to Somare's demands was built in Waigani.\n\n\nSeveral of the government buildings have been abandoned due to long-term neglect. Chief amongst these are Marea Haus (known to most locals as the \"Pineapple Building\") and the Central Government Offices.[*citation needed*] However, widespread restoration rather than demolition of long-disused office buildings has been highly active since the first decade of the 21st century.[*citation needed*] The legislative building before independence and the first parliament building is long-gone but the old court house in town Port Moresby remains, bearing its pre-independence label with its previous title.\n\n\nThe population of the Port Moresby area expanded rapidly after independence. In 1980, the census return registered a population of 120,000; by 1990, this had increased to 195,000.[16]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMoresby has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: *Aw*) with relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Port Moresby's average yearly rainfall is less than 900 mm, making it the driest place in New Guinea.\n\n\nThe wet season starts in December and ends in May; the dry season covers the remaining six months. This is due to the south easterly trade winds running parallel to the coast, and the city being surrounded by high mountains. The average high temperatures range from 28 to 32 °C (82.4 to 89.6 °F) depending on time of year, while the average low temperature shows very little seasonal variation, hovering around the 23 °C (73.4 °F) mark. It tends to be slightly cooler in the city during the dry season.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 36.2(97.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 35.4(95.7)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n | 32.4(90.3)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 27.6(81.7)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 14.4(57.9)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 192.2(7.57)\n | 140.6(5.54)\n | 189.8(7.47)\n | 105.2(4.14)\n | 56.2(2.21)\n | 21.6(0.85)\n | 13.8(0.54)\n | 12.0(0.47)\n | 14.4(0.57)\n | 15.2(0.60)\n | 40.0(1.57)\n | 97.8(3.85)\n | 898.8(35.38)\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 18\n | 16\n | 18\n | 11\n | 9\n | 6\n | 4\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | 6\n | 12\n | 114\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 81\n | 81\n | 82\n | 81\n | 79\n | 77\n | 76\n | 76\n | 76\n | 75\n | 77\n | 78\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 182\n | 158\n | 184\n | 200\n | 211\n | 200\n | 203\n | 222\n | 213\n | 231\n | 243\n | 216\n | 2,463\n |\n| Source 1: World Meteorological Organization[17] |\n| Source 2: Deutscher Wetterdienst (extremes, mean temperature, humidity and sun)[18][19][a] |\n\n## District, LLGs and suburbs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Port Moresby suburbs\n\n![](image)Urban sustainability analysis of the greater urban area of the city, using the Circles of Sustainability method of the UN Global Compact Cities Programme.\n![](image)Walter Bay from hills immediately east of downtown Port Moresby\n![](image)Ela Beach\n![](image)Coastal housing at Hanuabada in Port Moresby\nPort Moresby is the single district of the National Capital District, which contains three Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n| District | District Capital | LLG\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| National Capital District | Port Moresby\n | Moresby North-East |\n| Moresby North-West |\n| Moresby South |\n\n\nThe National Capital District machinery of government also incorporates the Motu Koita Assembly, established by an act of parliament to represent the traditional landowners of Port Moresby, the Motu and Koitabu people. The Assembly governs the traditional lands and inhabitants of the ten recognised villages, and is the only entity of its kind in Papua New Guinea. The Chair of the Motu Koita Assembly also holds the position of Deputy Governor of the National Capital District.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPort Moresby refers to both the urbanised area of the National Capital District and more specifically to the main business area, known locally as \"Town\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince the 1990s the original town centre has ceased to have restaurants and night life, though it is very successful and prosperous-looking as an office centre. The affluent housing region north of downtown along and up from the coast remains so, though there are now few modest residential houses, most of which are replaced with substantial mansions and apartment buildings.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe suburb of Boroko, once the commercial heart of Port Moresby, is very idle, with many former shopping buildings now[*when?*] empty; the west is full of high rises, shopping centres and affluent housing. Other neighbourhoods of Port Moresby include Koki, with its popular fresh produce market, Newtown, Konedobu, Kaevaga, Badili, Gabutu, Kila Kila, Matirogo, Three Mile, Kaugere, Sabama, Korobosea, Four Mile, Hohola, Hohola North, Boroko, Gordons, Gordons North, Erima, Saraga, Waigani, Morata and Gerehu.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Villages[edit]\n\n\nVillages within Port Moresby include:\n\n\n\n* Hanuabada, which offers a safe haven for LGBT people in PNG[21]\n* Kira Kira village[22] (sometimes spelt Kirakira[23]), the home town of Australian footballer Mary Fowler's mother\n\n\n## Crime[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Papua New Guinea\n\n*Al Jazeera* describes Port Moresby as \"one of the most dangerous cities in the world\".[24] *ABC Australia* reports that \"many homes have big fences covered in metal sheeting, locked gates and internal steel security doors.\"[25]\nTravel by foot is not recommended in and about the city and suburbs due to continuing breakdown in law and order. The UN Global Compact Cities Programme, using a method called Circles of Sustainability, has assessed the urban security of Port Moresby as 'critical'.[26]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jacksons International Airport, looking east across the airstrip.\nPort Moresby is served within the city by buses and privately owned taxis. Flights are vital for transport about the country, highways not being widely available. Port Moresby is served by Jacksons International Airport, the biggest international airport and Papua New Guinea Defence Force Air Wing base in the country.\n\n\nAs the national highway system is not fully linked, there are many internal flights to other towns, such as Lae and Madang, which have no direct road connection to Port Moresby.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Port Moresby, seen from the International Space Station\nPapua New Guinea is rich in natural resources, which account for two thirds of its export earnings. Though PNG is filled with resources, the lack of development led foreign countries to take over some sites. Continuing foreign demand for PNG's resources led the United States to set up an oil company that began to export in 2004. This was the largest project in PNG's history. The project increased the potential to triple PNG's export revenue. Papua New Guinea gained much assistance from Australia and was offered two hundred million dollars a year in aid, and many countries such as Singapore, Japan and China have also played a great part in PNG's industry business.[27] The decision to host the 2018 APEC meeting,[28] brought a large number of world leaders to Port Moresby.\n\n\nThere has been substantial building of housing, office towers, shopping malls and commercial establishments over much of the city.[*citation needed*] The waterfront area has been completely redeveloped with apartments, restaurants and shopping centres. Sporting facilities were upgraded significantly for the 2015 South Pacific Games, and further development took place in preparation for the 2016 FIFA Under-20 Women's World Cup.[29]\n\n\nAir Niugini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea, and Airlines PNG, the second biggest airline in the country, have their head offices on the grounds of Jacksons International Airport.[30]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 1969 South Pacific Games, held from 13 to 23 August 1969 at Port Moresby, were the third South Pacific Games to be held. A total of 1,150 athletes participated.[31]\n\n\nThe 1991 South Pacific Games held from 7–21 September 1991 at Port Moresby and along Lae were the ninth South Pacific Games to be held. This was the first time that events at one games had been held in two cities. The decision to do so was to allow both locations to benefit from the construction of new facilities.[32]\n\n\nCricket PNG is the official governing body of the sport of cricket in Papua New Guinea. Its headquarters is in Port Moresby. Cricket PNG is Papua New Guinea's representative at the International Cricket Council and is an associate member and has been a member of that body since 1973. It is also a member of the East Asia-Pacific Cricket Council.[33][34]\n\n\nThe city hosted the 2017 FIBA Melanesia Basketball Cup, where the Papua New Guinea national basketball team won the gold medal.\n\n\nThe city is home to the Port Moresby Vipers rugby league team who play in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League. The National football stadium is also home to the PNG Hunters, a rugby league team that compete in the majority Australian Queensland Cup.\n\n\n\n### 2015 Pacific Games in Port Moresby[edit]\n\n\nThe 2015 Pacific Games was held in Port Moresby from 4 to 18 July 2015.[35] In September 2009, the Pacific Games Council, at its meeting coinciding with the 2009 Pacific Mini Games, elected Port Moresby as the host of the 2015 Games. The final vote was 25–22 in favour of Port Moresby over Tonga to host.[36]\n\n\nThe 2015 Pacific Games involved 24 countries from the Pacific regions competing in 28 sports events, including: basketball, soccer, touch rugby, table tennis, weightlifting, triathlon, swimming, cricket, squash, shooting, sailing, va'a, rugby 7s, powerlifting, rugby league 9s, volleyball, beach volleyball, athletics, hockey, netball, karate, lawn bowls, bodybuilding, boxing, softball, taekwondo, golf, and canoeing. Papua New Guinea ranked first with the most medals followed by New Caledonia and Tahiti.[37]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony took place on the 4th of July 2015 involving various traditional dances.[38] The closing ceremony involved singers such as J Boog, Fiji, O-Shen and George Mamua Telek.[39]\n\n\n\n### Sports venues[edit]\n\n\n* Sir John Guise Stadium is the premier sports venue with a capacity of 15,000. It was completely rebuilt in 2015.\n* Amini Park is a cricket ground in Port Moresby.[40][41] The ground is named for the Amini family, several of whom have played cricket for Papua New Guinea (both the men's and women's teams),[42] the ground has seen the men's team play Australia, the West Indies and Victoria. The women's team played Japan in a three match series at the ground in September 2006.[43]\n* Lloyd Robson Oval is a sporting ground in Port Moresby and has hosted 3 games for the 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup. It has been the home ground for the Papua New Guinea national rugby league team since 1975 and the Port Moresby Vipers. It has a total capacity of approximately 17,000.\n* National Football Stadium – Papua New Guinea's National Football Stadium, formerly known as Lloyd Robson Oval, is located in Port Moresby and hosted three matches for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. The venue (Loyd Robson Oval) was completely redeveloped in 2015 and has an all-seated capacity of 15,000. This was completed in time for the Pacific Games. [44]\n\n\nThe venue has hosted the PNG national side since 1975 and has previously hosted Rugby League World Cup matches in 1986 and 1990. It is also home of the Hunters, the local Papua New Guinea team who play in the Intrust Super Cup which is the Queensland NRL tournament.\nThe National Football Stadium features a permanent main grandstand with seating for 3,000 including a roof and corporate facilities while temporary stands around the ground boost the seating capacity. There are also lights and a video screen.\n\n\n\n* PMRL Stadium is a football stadium in Port Moresby and it is used mainly for football and hosts the home matches of PRK Hekari United of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League and OFC Champions League. The stadium has a seating capacity of 15,000 spectators.[45]\n* Hubert Murray Stadium is a sports venue located in Port Moresby and was developed for the 1969 South Pacific Games on reclaimed land at Konedobu that had previously been shoreline mangroves.[31] The athletics events and the opening and closing ceremonies were held at the new stadium,[46] which was named after Sir Hubert Murray, a former lieutenant governor.[47] In 2015–16 it was completely rebuilt as a large capacity football ground.\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### International schools[edit]\n\n\nThe International Education Agency provides private education via six international schools; Korobosea International School, Boroko International School, Ela Murray International School, Gordon International School, Port Moresby International School and IEA TAFE college. There are approximately three hundred staff.[48]\n\n\nThe Port Moresby International School (POMIS) has been operating since the 1950s. It is an International Education Agency school and is the premier international high school in Port Moresby. It enrolls nearly 1000 students from Grades 7 to 12.[49]\n\n\nPort Moresby Japanese Language School (ポート・モレスビー補習授業校 *Pōto Moresubī Hoshū Jugyō Kō*) was a supplementary Japanese school in the city.[50] It closed in August 2009.[51]\n\n\n\n## Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Oceania\n\nPort Moresby is twinned with:\n\n\n\n* ![China](image) Jinan, China[52]\n* ![Fiji](image) Suva, Fiji[53]\n* ![Australia](image) Townsville, Australia[54]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)New Guinea portal\n\n\n* Naval Base Port Moresby\n* Port Moresby Airfield Complex\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sub-national HDI - Area Database - Global Data Lab\". *hdi.globaldatalab.org*. `{{cite web}}`: Missing or empty `|url=` (help)[*full citation needed*]\n2. **^** \"CIA World Factbook\". `{{cite web}}`: Missing or empty `|url=` (help)[*full citation needed*]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tlozek, Eric (30 June 2018). \"Security in PNG's Port Moresby under spotlight as APEC summit approaches\". *ABC*.

Situated at the geographic centre of Maritime Southeast Asia, it is one of the Greater Sunda Islands, located north of Java, west of Sulawesi, and east of Sumatra.\n\n\nThe island is politically divided among three countries: Malaysia and Brunei in the north, and Indonesia to the south.[4] Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. In the north, the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak make up about 26% of the island. The population in Borneo is 23,053,723 (2020 national censuses).[1][2][3]\n\n\nAdditionally, the Malaysian federal territory of Labuan is situated on a small island just off the coast of Borneo. The sovereign state of Brunei, located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo's land area. A little more than half of the island is in the Northern Hemisphere, including Brunei and the Malaysian portion, while the Indonesian portion spans the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Native people of Borneo referred to their island as *Pulu K'lemantang* but not as an ethnic name, when the sixteenth century Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes made contact with the native which became the name for modern-day Indonesian Borneo.[5][6][7] The term kelamantan is used in Sarawak to refer to a group of people who consume sago in the northern part of the island.[8] According to Crowfurd, the word kelamantan is the name of a type of mango (Mangifera) so the island of Borneo is called a mango island by the native. But he adds that the word is fanciful and unpopular.[9] The local mango, called klemantan, is still widely found in rural areas in Ketapang and surrounding areas of West Kalimantan.[10]\n\n\nInternationally it is known as *Borneo*, derived from European contact with the Brunei kingdom in the 16th century during the Age of Exploration. On a map from around 1601, Brunei city is referred to as Borneo, and the whole island is also labelled Borneo.[11][12] The name *Borneo* may derive from the Sanskrit word **váruṇa** (वरुण), meaning either \"water\" or Varuna, the Hindu god of rain.[13]\n\n\nAnother source said it was from the Sanskrit word *Kalamanthana*, meaning \"burning weather\" possibly to describe its hot and humid tropical weather.[14] In Indianized malay era the name *Kalamanthana* was derived from Sanskrit terms *kala* (time or season) and *manthana* (churning, kindling or creating fire by friction),[15] which possibly describes the heat of the weather.[16]\n\n\nIn 977, Chinese records began to use the term *Bo-ni* to refer to Borneo. In 1225, it was also mentioned by the Chinese official Chau Ju-Kua (趙汝适).[17] The Javanese manuscript Nagarakretagama, written by Majapahit court poet Mpu Prapanca in 1365, mentioned the island as *Nusa Tanjungnagara*, which means the island of the Tanjungpura Kingdom.[18]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Geological history of Borneo\n\n![](image)Location of Borneo in Maritime Southeast Asia. The Red River Fault is included.\nBorneo was formed through Mesozoic accretion of microcontinental fragments, ophiolite terranes and island arc crust onto a Paleozoic continental core. At the beginning of the Cenozoic Borneo formed a promontory of Sundaland which partly separated from Asian mainland by the proto-South China Sea.[19] The oceanic part of the proto-South China Sea was subducted during the Paleogene period and a large accretionary complex formed along the northwestern of the island of Borneo. In the early Miocene uplift of the accretionary complex occurred as a result of underthrusting of thinned continental crust in northwest.[19] The uplift may have also resulted from shortening due to the counter-clockwise rotation of Borneo between 20 and 10 mega-annum (Ma) as a consequence of Australia-Southeast Asia collision.[19] Large volumes of sediment were shed into basins, which scattered offshore to the west, north and east of Borneo as well into a Neogene basin which is currently exposed in large areas of eastern and southern Sabah. In southeast Sabah, the Miocene to recent island arc terranes of the Sulu Archipelago extend onshore into Borneo with the older volcanic arc was the result of southeast dipping subduction while the younger volcanics are likely resulted from northwest dipping subduction the Celebes Sea.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rich marine life off the coast of Borneo, in the Sulu Sea\nBefore sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age, Borneo was part of the mainland of Asia, forming, with Java and Sumatra, the upland regions of a peninsula that extended east from present day Indochina. The South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand now submerge the former low-lying areas of the peninsula. Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring Sulawesi prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as Wallace's Line between Asian and Australia-New Guinea biological regions.[20][21] The island today is surrounded by the South China Sea to the north and northwest, the Sulu Sea to the northeast, the Celebes Sea and the Makassar Strait to the east, and the Java Sea and Karimata Strait to the south. To the west of Borneo are the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. To the south and east are islands of Indonesia: Java and Sulawesi, respectively. To the northeast are the Philippine Islands. With an area of 743,330 square kilometres (287,000 sq mi), it is the third-largest island in the world, and is the largest island of Asia (the largest continent). Its highest point is Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia, with an elevation of 4,095 m (13,435 ft).[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lake Sentarum, Kapuas Hulu Regency, West Kalimantan\nThe largest river system is the Kapuas in West Kalimantan, with a length of 1,143 km (710 mi).[23] Other major rivers include the Mahakam in East Kalimantan (980 km (610 mi) long),[24] the Barito, Kahayan, and Mendawai in South Kalimantan (1,090 km (680 mi), 658 km (409 mi), and 616 km (383 mi) long respectively),[25] Rajang in Sarawak (565 km (351 mi) long)[26] and Kinabatangan in Sabah (560 km (350 mi) long).[27] Borneo has significant cave systems. In Sarawak, the Clearwater Cave has one of the world's longest underground rivers while Deer Cave is home to over three million bats, with guano accumulated to over 100 metres (330 ft) deep.[28] The Gomantong Caves in Sabah has been dubbed as the \"Cockroach Cave\" due to the presence of millions of cockroaches inside the cave.[29][30] The Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak and Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Karst in East Kalimantan which particularly a karst areas contains thousands of smaller caves.[31]\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Biodiversity of Borneo, Fauna of Borneo, Flora of Borneo, List of endemic birds of Borneo, and List of mammals of Borneo\n\n![](image)The critically endangered Bornean orangutan, a great ape endemic to Borneo\nThe Borneo rainforest is estimated to be around 140 million years old, making it one of the oldest rainforests in the world.[32] The current dominant tree group, the dipterocarps, has dominated the Borneo lowland rain forests for millions of years.[33] It is the centre of the evolution and distribution of many endemic species of plants and animals, and the rainforest is one of the few remaining natural habitats for the endangered Bornean orangutan. It is an important refuge for many endemic forest species, including the Borneo elephant, the eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, the Bornean clouded leopard, the Bornean rock frog, the hose's palm civet and the dayak fruit bat.[34][35]\n\n\n\n![](image)NASA satellite image of Borneo on 19 May 2002\nPeat swamp forests occupy the entire coastline of Borneo.[36] The soil of the peat swamp is comparatively infertile, while it is known to be the home of various bird species such as the hook-billed bulbul, helmeted hornbill and rhinoceros hornbill.[37] There are about 15,000 species of flowering plants with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are dipterocarps), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo.[38] There are about 440 freshwater fish species in Borneo (about the same as Sumatra and Java combined).[39] The Borneo river shark is known only from the Kinabatangan River.[40] In 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) stated that 123 species have been discovered in Borneo since the \"Heart of Borneo\" agreement was signed in 2007.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Logging road in East Kalimantan, Indonesia\nThe WWF has classified the island into seven distinct ecoregions. Most are lowland regions:[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n* Borneo lowland rain forests cover most of the island, with an area of 427,500 square kilometres (165,100 sq mi).\n* Borneo peat swamp forests\n* *Kerangas* or Sundaland heath forests\n* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests are found in the island's western and southern lowlands\n* Sunda Shelf mangroves\n* The Borneo montane rain forests lie in the central highlands of the island, above the 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) elevation.\n* The highest elevations of Mount Kinabalu are home to the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows, a subalpine and alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.\n\n\nAccording to analysis of data from Global Forest Watch,[45] the Indonesian portion of Borneo lost 10.7 million hectares (26 million acres) of tree cover between 2002 and 2019, of which 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) was primary forest, compared with Malaysian Borneo's 4.4 million hectares (11 million acres) of tree cover loss and 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres) of primary forest cover loss. As of 2020, Indonesian Borneo accounts for 72% of the island's tree cover, Malaysian Borneo 27%, and Brunei 1%. Primary forest in Indonesia accounts for 44% of Borneo's overall tree cover.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Conservation issues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Deforestation in Borneo, 1997 Indonesian forest fires, 1997 Southeast Asian haze, 2006 Southeast Asian haze, 2013 Southeast Asian haze, 2015 Southeast Asian haze, 2016 Southeast Asian haze, and 2019 Southeast Asian haze\n\n![](image)Logging near Crocker Range National Park. Borneo has lost more than half of its rainforests in the past half a century.[47]\nThe island historically had extensive rainforest cover, but the area was reduced due to heavy logging by the Indonesian and Malaysian wood industry, especially with the large demands of raw materials from industrial countries along with the conversion of forest lands for large-scale agricultural purposes.[42] Half of the annual global tropical timber acquisition comes from Borneo. Palm oil plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest.[48] Forest fires since 1997, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry El Niño season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest.[49] During these fires, hotspots were visible on satellite images and the resulting haze frequently affected Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. The haze could also reach southern Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines as evidenced on the 2015 Southeast Asian haze.[50]\n\n\nA 2018 study found that Bornean orangutans declined by 148,500 individuals from 1999 to 2015.[51]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia, the highest summit of the island[22]\nList of highest peaks in Borneo by elevation.\n\n\n\n* Mount Kinabalu 13,435 ft (4,095 m)\n* Mount Trusmadi 8,668 ft (2,642 m)\n* Raya Hill 7.474 ft (2.278 m)\n* Muruk Miau 6,837 ft (2,084 m)\n* Mount Wakid 6,778 ft (2,066 m)\n* Monkobo Hill 5,866 ft (1,788 m)\n* Mount Lotung 5,843 ft (1,781 m)\n* Mount Magdalena 4,288 ft (1,307 m)\n* Talibu Hill 4,144 ft (1,263 m)\n\n\n### River systems[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kapuas River in Indonesia; at 1,000 km (620 mi) in length, it is the longest river in Borneo.[23]\nList of longest river in Borneo by length.\n\n\n\n* Kapuas River 1,143 km (710 mi)\n* Barito River 1,090 km (680 mi)\n* Mahakam River 980 km (610 mi)\n* Kahayan River 658 km (409 mi)\n* Mendawai River 616 km (383 mi)\n* Kayan River 576 km (358 mi)\n* Rajang River 565 km (351 mi)\n* Kinabatangan River 560 km (350 mi)\n* Baram River 400 km (250 mi)\n* Sembakung River 352 km (219 mi)\n* Sesayap River 279 km (173 mi)\n* Pawan River 197 km (122 mi)\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dayak, the main indigenous people in the island, were feared for their headhunting practices.\nIn November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the island of Borneo.[52][53]\n\n\nAccording to ancient Chinese (977),[54]: 129 Indian and Japanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports by the first millennium AD.[55] In Chinese manuscripts, gold, camphor, tortoise shells, hornbill ivory, rhinoceros horn, crane crest, beeswax, lakawood (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick liana, *Dalbergia parviflora*), dragon's blood, rattan, edible bird's nests and various spices were described as among the most valuable items from Borneo.[56] The Indians named Borneo *Suvarnabhumi* (the land of gold) and also *Karpuradvipa* (Camphor Island). The Javanese named Borneo *Puradvipa*, or Diamond Island. Archaeological findings in the Sarawak river delta reveal that the area was a thriving centre of trade between India and China from the 6th century until about 1300.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territorial loss of the thalassocracy of the Sultanate of Brunei from 1400 to 1890 due to the beginning of Western imperialism\nStone pillars bearing inscriptions in the Pallava script, found in Kutai along the Mahakam River in East Kalimantan and dating to around the second half of the 4th century, constitute some of the oldest evidence of Hindu influence in Southeast Asia.[57] By the 14th century, Borneo became a vassal state of Majapahit (in present-day Indonesia),[58][59] later changing its allegiance to the Ming dynasty of China.[60] Pre-Islamic Sulu, then known locally as Lupah Sug, stretched from Palawan and the Sulu archipelago at the Philippines; to Sabah, Eastern, and Northern Kalimantan in Borneo.[61] The Sulu empire rose as a rebellion and reaction against former Majapahit Imperialism against Sulu which Majapahit briefly occupied. The religion of Islam entered the island in the 10th century,[62] following the arrival of Muslim traders who later converted many indigenous peoples in the coastal areas.[63]\n\n\nThe Sultanate of Brunei declared independence from Majapahit following the death of the Majapahit emperor in the mid-14th century. During its golden age under Bolkiah from the 15th to the 17th century, the Bruneian sultanate ruled almost the entire coastal area of Borneo (lending its name to the island due to its influence in the region) and several islands in the Philippines.[64] During the 1450s, Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr, an Arab born in Johor,[65] arrived in Sulu from Malacca. In 1457, he founded the Sultanate of Sulu; he titled himself as \"Paduka Maulana Mahasari Sharif Sultan Hashem Abu Bakr\".[66] Following its independence in 1578 from Brunei's influence,[67] Sulu began to expand its thalassocracy to parts of the northern Borneo.[68][69] Both the sultanates who ruled northern Borneo had traditionally engaged in trade with China by means of the frequently-arriving Chinese junks.[70][71] Despite the thalassocracy of the sultanates, Borneo's interior region remained free from the rule of any kingdoms.[72]\n\n\n\n### British and Dutch control[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Borneo and Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)British flag hoisted for the first time on the island of Labuan on 24 December 1846\nSince the fall of Malacca in 1511, Portuguese merchants traded regularly with Borneo, and especially with Brunei from 1530.[73] Having visited Brunei's capital, the Portuguese described the place as surrounded by a stone wall.[74] While Borneo was seen as rich, the Portuguese did not make any attempts to conquer it.[73] The Spanish had sailed from Latin America and conquered the Brunei's provinces in the Philippines and incorporated it into the Mexico-Centered Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spanish visit to Brunei led to the Castilian War in 1578. The English began to trade with Sambas of southern Borneo in 1609, while the Dutch only began their trade in 1644: to Banjar and Martapura, also in the southern Borneo.[75] The Dutch tried to settle the island of Balambangan, north of Borneo, in the second half of the 18th century, but withdrew by 1797.[76] In 1812, the sultan in southern Borneo ceded his forts to the English East India Company. The English, led by Stamford Raffles, then tried to establish an intervention in Sambas but failed. Although they managed to defeat the sultanate the next year and declared a blockade on all ports in Borneo except Brunei, Banjarmasin and Pontianak, the project was cancelled by the British governor-general Lord Minto in India as it was too expensive.[76] At the beginning of British and Dutch exploration on the island, they described the island of Borneo as full of head hunters, with the indigenous in the interior practising cannibalism,[77] and the waters around the island infested with pirates, especially between the north eastern Borneo and the southern Philippines.[78][79] The Malay and Sea Dayak pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo,[80] along with the attacks by Illanuns of the Moro pirates from the southern Philippines, such as in the Battle off Mukah.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the island divided between the British and the Dutch, 1898. The present boundaries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei are largely inherited from the British and Dutch colonial rules.\nThe Dutch began to intervene in the southern part of the island upon resuming contact in 1815, posting *residents* to Banjarmasin, Pontianak and Sambas and *assistant-residents* to Landak and Mampawa.[82][83] The Sultanate of Brunei in 1842 granted large parts of land in Sarawak to the English adventurer James Brooke, as a reward for his help in quelling a local rebellion. Brooke established the Raj of Sarawak and was recognised as its rajah after paying a fee to the sultanate. He established a monarchy, and the Brooke dynasty (through his nephew and great-nephew) ruled Sarawak for 100 years; the leaders were known as the White Rajahs.[84][85] Brooke also acquired the island of Labuan for Great Britain in 1846 through the Treaty of Labuan with the sultan of Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddin II on 18 December 1846.[86] The region of northern Borneo came under the administration of North Borneo Chartered Company following the acquisition of territory from the Sultanates of Brunei and Sulu by a German businessman and adventurer named Baron von Overbeck, before it was passed to the British Dent brothers (comprising Alfred Dent and Edward Dent).[69][87] Further expansion by the British continued into the Borneo interior.[88] This led the 26th sultan of Brunei, Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin to appeal the British to halt such efforts, and as a result a Treaty of Protection was signed in 1888, rendering Brunei a British protectorate.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Dayak tribe during an Erau ceremony in Tenggarong\nBefore the acquisition by the British, the Americans also managed to establish their temporary presence in northwestern Borneo after acquiring a parcel of land from the Sultanate of Brunei. A company known as American Trading Company of Borneo was formed by Joseph William Torrey, Thomas Bradley Harris and several Chinese investors, establishing a colony named \"Ellena\" in the Kimanis area.[90] The colony failed and was abandoned, due to denials of financial backing, especially by the US government, and to diseases and riots among the workers.[91] Before Torrey left, he managed to sell the land to the German businessman, Overbeck.[92] Meanwhile, the Germans under William Frederick Schuck were awarded a parcel of land in northeastern Borneo of the Sandakan Bay from the Sultanate of Sulu where he conducted business and exported large quantities of arms, opium, textiles and tobacco to Sulu before the land was also passed to Overbeck by the sultanate.[93][94]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arab-Malay Sultan of Pontianak in 1930\nPrior to the recognition of Spanish presence in the Philippine archipelago, a protocol known as the Madrid Protocol of 1885 was signed between the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain in Madrid to cement Spanish influence and recognise their sovereignty over the Sultanate of Sulu—in return for Spain's relinquishing its claim to the former possessions of the sultanate in northern Borneo.[95][96] The British administration then established the first railway network in northern Borneo, known as the North Borneo Railway.[97][98] During this time, the British sponsored a large number of Chinese workers to migrate to northern Borneo to work in European plantation and mines,[99] and the Dutch followed suit to increase their economic production.[100] By 1888, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei in northern Borneo had become British protectorate.[101] The area in southern Borneo was made Dutch protectorate in 1891.[77] The Dutch who already claimed the whole Borneo were asked by Britain to delimit their boundaries between the two colonial territories to avoid further conflicts.[101] The British and Dutch governments had signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 to exchange trading ports in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra that were under their controls and assert spheres of influence. This resulted in indirectly establishing British- and Dutch-controlled areas in the north (Malay Peninsula) and south (Sumatra and Riau Islands) respectively.[102]\n\n\nIn 1895, Marcus Samuel received a concession in the Kutei area of east Borneo, and based on oil seepages in the Mahakam River delta, Mark Abrahams struck oil in February 1897. This was the discovery of the Sanga Sanga Oil Field, a refinery was built in Balikpapan, and discovery of the Samboja Oil Field followed in 1909. In 1901, the Pamusian Oil Field was discovered on Tarakan, and the Bunyu Oil Field in 1929. Royal Dutch Shell discovered the Miri Oil Field in 1910, and the Seria oil field in 1929.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Japanese occupation of British Borneo and Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)Japanese troops march through the streets of Labuan on 14 January 1942.\n![](image)American support craft moving towards Victoria and Brown beach to assist the landing of the members of Australian 24th Infantry Brigade on the island during Operation Oboe Six, 10 June 1945\nDuring World War II, Japanese forces gained control and occupied most areas of Borneo from 1941 to 1945. In the first stage of the war, the British saw the Japanese advance to Borneo as motivated by political and territorial ambitions rather than economic factors.[106] The occupation drove many people in the coastal towns to the interior, searching for food and escaping the Japanese.[107] The Chinese residents in Borneo, especially with the Sino-Japanese War in Mainland China mostly resisted the Japanese occupation.[108] Following the formation of resistance movements in northern Borneo such as the Jesselton Revolt, many innocent indigenous and Chinese people were executed by the Japanese for their alleged involvement.[109]\n\n\nIn Kalimantan, the Japanese also killed many Malay intellectuals, executing all the Malay sultans of West Kalimantan in the Pontianak incidents, together with Chinese people who were already against the Japanese for suspecting them to be threats.[110] Sultan Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II of Sambas was executed in 1944. The sultanate was thereafter suspended and replaced by a Japanese council.[111] The Japanese also set-up *Pusat Tenaga Rakjat* (PUTERA)[112] in the Indonesian archipelago in 1943, although it was abolished the following year when it became too nationalistic.[113] Some of the Indonesian nationalist like Sukarno and Hatta who had returned from Dutch exile began to co-operate with the Japanese. Shortly after his release, Sukarno became president of the Central Advisory Council, an advisory council for south Borneo, Celebes, and Lesser Sunda, set up in February 1945.[113]\n\n\nSince the fall of Singapore, the Japanese sent several thousand of British and Australian prisoners of war to camps in Borneo such as Batu Lintang camp. From the Sandakan camp site, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived after they were forced to march in an event known as the Sandakan Death March.[114] In addition, of the total of 17,488 Javanese labourers brought in by the Japanese during the occupation, only 1,500 survived mainly due to starvation, harsh working conditions and maltreatment.[107] The Dayak and other indigenous people played a role in guerrilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division. They temporarily revived headhunting of Japanese toward the end of the war,[115] with Allied Z Special Unit provided assistance to them.[116] Australia contributed significantly to the liberation of Borneo.[117] The Australian Imperial Force was sent to Borneo to fight off the Japanese.[118] Together with other Allies, the island was completely liberated in 1945.\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sukarno visiting Pontianak, West Kalimantan, in 1963\nIn May 1945, officials in Tokyo suggested that whether northern Borneo should be included in the proposed new country of Indonesia should be separately determined based on the desires of its indigenous people and following the disposition of Malaya.[119] Sukarno and Mohammad Yamin meanwhile continuously advocated for a Greater Indonesian republic.[120] Towards the end of the war, Japan decided to give an early independence to a new proposed country of Indonesia on 17 July 1945, with an Independence Committee meeting scheduled for 19 August 1945.[113] However, following the surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, the meeting was shelved. Sukarno and Hatta continued the plan by unilaterally declaring independence, although the Dutch tried to retake their colonial possession in Borneo.[113]\n\n\nThe southern part of the island achieved its independence through the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August 1945. The southern part saw guerrilla conflicts followed by Dutch blockade to cut supplies for nationalist within the region.[121] While nationalist guerrillas supporting the inclusion of southern Borneo in the new Indonesian republic were active in Ketapang, and to lesser extent in Sambas where they rallied with the red-white flag which became the flag of Indonesia, most of the Chinese residents in southern Borneo expected to be liberated by Chinese Nationalist troops from mainland China and to integrate their districts as an overseas province of China.[122] Meanwhile, Sarawak and Sabah in northern Borneo became separate British crown colonies in 1946.[123][124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Queen's Own Highlanders 1st Battalion conduct a patrol to search for enemy positions in the jungle of Brunei.\nIn 1961, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman of the independent Federation of Malaya desired to unite Malaya, the British colonies of Sarawak, North Borneo, Singapore and the protectorate of Brunei under the proposed Federation of Malaysia.[125] The idea was heavily opposed by the governments in both Indonesia and the Philippines as well from communist sympathisers and nationalists in Borneo.[126][127] Sukarno, as the president of the new republic, perceiving the British trying to maintain their presence in northern Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, decided to launch a military infiltration, later known as the *confrontation*, from 1962 to 1969.[128] As a response to the growing opposition, the British deployed their armed forces to guard their colonies against Indonesian and communist revolts,[129] which was also participated by Australia and New Zealand.[130][131]\n\n\nThe Philippines opposed the newly proposed federation, claiming the eastern part of North Borneo (today the Malaysian state of Sabah) as part of its territory as a former possession of the Sultanate of Sulu.[132] The Philippine government mostly based their claim on the Sultanate of Sulu's cession agreement with the British North Borneo Company, as by now the sultanate had come under the jurisdiction of the Philippine republican administration, which therefore should inherit the Sulu former territories. The Philippine government also claimed that the heirs of the sultanate had ceded all their territorial rights to the republic.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The proposed flag of the North Borneo Federation, an attempt to establish a sovereign state by unifying North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak by A. M. Azahari\nThe Sultanate of Brunei at the first welcomed the proposal of a new larger federation.[134] Meanwhile, the Brunei People's Party led by A.M. Azahari desired to reunify Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo into one federation known as the North Borneo Federation (Malay: *Kesatuan Negara Kalimantan Utara*), where the sultan of Brunei would be the head of state for the federation—though Azahari had his own intention to abolish the Brunei monarchy, to make Brunei more democratic, and to integrate the territory and other former British colonies in Borneo into Indonesia, with the support from the latter government.[135] This directly led to the Brunei Revolt, which thwarted Azahari's attempt and forced him to escape to Indonesia. Brunei withdrew from being part of the new Federation of Malaysia due to some disagreements on other issues while political leaders in Sarawak and North Borneo continued to favour inclusion in a larger federation.[136]\n\n\nWith the continuous opposition from Indonesia and the Philippines, the Cobbold Commission was established to discover the feeling of the native populations in northern Borneo; it found the people greatly in favour of federation, with various stipulations.[137][138] The federation was successfully achieved with the inclusion of northern Borneo through the Malaysia Agreement on 16 September 1963.[139] To this day, the area in northern Borneo is still subjected to attacks by Moro pirates since the 18th century and militant from groups such as Abu Sayyaf since 2000 in the frequent cross border attacks. During the administration of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, Marcos made some attempts to destabilise the state of Sabah,[140] although his plan failed and resulted in the Jabidah massacre and later the insurgency in the southern Philippines.[141][142]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced a plan to move the capital of Indonesia from Jakarta to a newly established location in the East Kalimantan province in Borneo.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nThe demonym for Borneo is **Bornean**.[144]\n\n\nBorneo had 23,053,723 inhabitants (in 2020 Censuses),[1][2] a population density of 30.8 inhabitants per square kilometre (80 inhabitants per square mile).

Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seria Oil Refinery, Brunei Darussalam\nBorneo's economy depends mainly on agriculture, logging and mining, oil and gas, and ecotourism.[156] Brunei's economy is highly dependent on the oil and gas production sector, and the country has become one of the largest oil producers in Southeast Asia. The Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak are both top exporters of timber.[156] Sabah is also known as the agricultural producer of rubber, cacao, and vegetables, and for its fisheries, while Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan export liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petroleum. The Indonesian provinces of Kalimantan are mostly dependent on mining sectors despite also being involved in logging and oil and gas explorations.[156]\n\n\n\n### List of territories by GDP/GRP[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Indonesian provinces by GDP, List of Indonesian provinces by GRP per capita, and List of Malaysian states by GDP\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Province/State\n | GDP Nominal\n | GDP/GRP per capita\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **![](image) Brunei**[148][149] |  | US$ 14.1 billion | US$ 42,939\n |\n| **![](image) Indonesia** (**Kalimantan**)[150] | ![](image) North Kalimantan | US$ 9.34 billion | US$ 12,837\n |\n| ![](image) East Kalimantan | US$ 62.05 billion | US$ 16,075\n |\n| ![](image) South Kalimantan | US$ 16.92 billion | US$ 4,046\n |\n| ![](image) Central Kalimantan | US$ 13.47 billion | US$ 4,913\n |\n| ![](image) West Kalimantan | US$ 17.23 billion | US$ 3,109\n |\n| **![](image) Malaysia** (**East Malaysia**)[151][152] | ![](image) Sabah | US$ 22.74 billion | US$ 6,654\n |\n| ![](image) Sarawak | US$ 36.19 billion | US$ 14,653\n |\n| ![](image) Labuan | US$ 1.36 billion | US$ 18,068\n |\n\n\n## Human Development Index by territory[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Indonesian provinces by Human Development Index and List of Malaysian states by Human Development Index\n\n**HDI** is a statistic of combined indicators that takes into account life expectancy, health, education and per-capita income.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Country\n | Province/State\n | HDI score\n | Country comparison\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **![](image) Brunei** |  | 0.829 (2022) | ![](image) Kuwait (0.831)\n |\n| **![](image) Indonesia** (**Kalimantan**) | ![](image) North Kalimantan | 0.718 (2022) | ![](image) Paraguay (0.717)\n |\n| ![](image) East Kalimantan | 0.774 (2022) | ![](image) Iran (0.774)\n |\n| ![](image) South Kalimantan | 0.718 (2022) | ![](image) Paraguay (0.717)\n |\n| ![](image) Central Kalimantan | 0.716 (2022) | ![](image) Paraguay (0.717)\n |\n| ![](image) West Kalimantan | 0.686 (2022) | ![](image) Iraq (0.686)\n |\n| **![](image) Malaysia** (**East Malaysia**) | ![](image) Sabah | 0.702 (2021) | ![](image) Vietnam (0.703)\n |\n| ![](image) Sarawak | 0.737 (2021) | ![](image) Mongolia (0.739)\n |\n| ![](image) Labuan | 0.777 (2021) | ![](image) Saint Kitts and Nevis (0.777)\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n\n\n* Hikayat Banjar\n* Kutai basin\n* List of islands of Indonesia\n* List of islands of Malaysia\n* Maphilindo\n* List of bats of Borneo\n\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) Indonesia\n* ![flag](image) Malaysia\n* ![icon](image) Islands\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Sugianto, Danang. \"Sensus Penduduk 2020 Selesai, Begini Sebaran Masyarakat RI Terbaru\". *finance.detik.com*.

Situated at the geographic centre of Maritime Southeast Asia, it is one of the Greater Sunda Islands, located north of Java, west of Sulawesi, and east of Sumatra.\n\n\nThe island is politically divided among three countries: Malaysia and Brunei in the north, and Indonesia to the south.[4] Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. In the north, the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak make up about 26% of the island. The population in Borneo is 23,053,723 (2020 national censuses).[1][2][3]\n\n\nAdditionally, the Malaysian federal territory of Labuan is situated on a small island just off the coast of Borneo. The sovereign state of Brunei, located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo's land area. A little more than half of the island is in the Northern Hemisphere, including Brunei and the Malaysian portion, while the Indonesian portion spans the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Native people of Borneo referred to their island as *Pulu K'lemantang* but not as an ethnic name, when the sixteenth century Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes made contact with the native which became the name for modern-day Indonesian Borneo.[5][6][7] The term kelamantan is used in Sarawak to refer to a group of people who consume sago in the northern part of the island.[8] According to Crowfurd, the word kelamantan is the name of a type of mango (Mangifera) so the island of Borneo is called a mango island by the native. But he adds that the word is fanciful and unpopular.[9] The local mango, called klemantan, is still widely found in rural areas in Ketapang and surrounding areas of West Kalimantan.[10]\n\n\nInternationally it is known as *Borneo*, derived from European contact with the Brunei kingdom in the 16th century during the Age of Exploration. On a map from around 1601, Brunei city is referred to as Borneo, and the whole island is also labelled Borneo.[11][12] The name *Borneo* may derive from the Sanskrit word **váruṇa** (वरुण), meaning either \"water\" or Varuna, the Hindu god of rain.[13]\n\n\nAnother source said it was from the Sanskrit word *Kalamanthana*, meaning \"burning weather\" possibly to describe its hot and humid tropical weather.[14] In Indianized malay era the name *Kalamanthana* was derived from Sanskrit terms *kala* (time or season) and *manthana* (churning, kindling or creating fire by friction),[15] which possibly describes the heat of the weather.[16]\n\n\nIn 977, Chinese records began to use the term *Bo-ni* to refer to Borneo. In 1225, it was also mentioned by the Chinese official Chau Ju-Kua (趙汝适).[17] The Javanese manuscript Nagarakretagama, written by Majapahit court poet Mpu Prapanca in 1365, mentioned the island as *Nusa Tanjungnagara*, which means the island of the Tanjungpura Kingdom.[18]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Geological history of Borneo\n\n![](image)Location of Borneo in Maritime Southeast Asia. The Red River Fault is included.\nBorneo was formed through Mesozoic accretion of microcontinental fragments, ophiolite terranes and island arc crust onto a Paleozoic continental core. At the beginning of the Cenozoic Borneo formed a promontory of Sundaland which partly separated from Asian mainland by the proto-South China Sea.[19] The oceanic part of the proto-South China Sea was subducted during the Paleogene period and a large accretionary complex formed along the northwestern of the island of Borneo. In the early Miocene uplift of the accretionary complex occurred as a result of underthrusting of thinned continental crust in northwest.[19] The uplift may have also resulted from shortening due to the counter-clockwise rotation of Borneo between 20 and 10 mega-annum (Ma) as a consequence of Australia-Southeast Asia collision.[19] Large volumes of sediment were shed into basins, which scattered offshore to the west, north and east of Borneo as well into a Neogene basin which is currently exposed in large areas of eastern and southern Sabah. In southeast Sabah, the Miocene to recent island arc terranes of the Sulu Archipelago extend onshore into Borneo with the older volcanic arc was the result of southeast dipping subduction while the younger volcanics are likely resulted from northwest dipping subduction the Celebes Sea.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rich marine life off the coast of Borneo, in the Sulu Sea\nBefore sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age, Borneo was part of the mainland of Asia, forming, with Java and Sumatra, the upland regions of a peninsula that extended east from present day Indochina. The South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand now submerge the former low-lying areas of the peninsula. Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring Sulawesi prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide known as Wallace's Line between Asian and Australia-New Guinea biological regions.[20][21] The island today is surrounded by the South China Sea to the north and northwest, the Sulu Sea to the northeast, the Celebes Sea and the Makassar Strait to the east, and the Java Sea and Karimata Strait to the south. To the west of Borneo are the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. To the south and east are islands of Indonesia: Java and Sulawesi, respectively. To the northeast are the Philippine Islands. With an area of 743,330 square kilometres (287,000 sq mi), it is the third-largest island in the world, and is the largest island of Asia (the largest continent). Its highest point is Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia, with an elevation of 4,095 m (13,435 ft).[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lake Sentarum, Kapuas Hulu Regency, West Kalimantan\nThe largest river system is the Kapuas in West Kalimantan, with a length of 1,143 km (710 mi).[23] Other major rivers include the Mahakam in East Kalimantan (980 km (610 mi) long),[24] the Barito, Kahayan, and Mendawai in South Kalimantan (1,090 km (680 mi), 658 km (409 mi), and 616 km (383 mi) long respectively),[25] Rajang in Sarawak (565 km (351 mi) long)[26] and Kinabatangan in Sabah (560 km (350 mi) long).[27] Borneo has significant cave systems. In Sarawak, the Clearwater Cave has one of the world's longest underground rivers while Deer Cave is home to over three million bats, with guano accumulated to over 100 metres (330 ft) deep.[28] The Gomantong Caves in Sabah has been dubbed as the \"Cockroach Cave\" due to the presence of millions of cockroaches inside the cave.[29][30] The Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak and Sangkulirang-Mangkalihat Karst in East Kalimantan which particularly a karst areas contains thousands of smaller caves.[31]\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Biodiversity of Borneo, Fauna of Borneo, Flora of Borneo, List of endemic birds of Borneo, and List of mammals of Borneo\n\n![](image)The critically endangered Bornean orangutan, a great ape endemic to Borneo\nThe Borneo rainforest is estimated to be around 140 million years old, making it one of the oldest rainforests in the world.[32] The current dominant tree group, the dipterocarps, has dominated the Borneo lowland rain forests for millions of years.[33] It is the centre of the evolution and distribution of many endemic species of plants and animals, and the rainforest is one of the few remaining natural habitats for the endangered Bornean orangutan. It is an important refuge for many endemic forest species, including the Borneo elephant, the eastern Sumatran rhinoceros, the Bornean clouded leopard, the Bornean rock frog, the hose's palm civet and the dayak fruit bat.[34][35]\n\n\n\n![](image)NASA satellite image of Borneo on 19 May 2002\nPeat swamp forests occupy the entire coastline of Borneo.[36] The soil of the peat swamp is comparatively infertile, while it is known to be the home of various bird species such as the hook-billed bulbul, helmeted hornbill and rhinoceros hornbill.[37] There are about 15,000 species of flowering plants with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are dipterocarps), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo.[38] There are about 440 freshwater fish species in Borneo (about the same as Sumatra and Java combined).[39] The Borneo river shark is known only from the Kinabatangan River.[40] In 2010, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) stated that 123 species have been discovered in Borneo since the \"Heart of Borneo\" agreement was signed in 2007.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Logging road in East Kalimantan, Indonesia\nThe WWF has classified the island into seven distinct ecoregions. Most are lowland regions:[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n* Borneo lowland rain forests cover most of the island, with an area of 427,500 square kilometres (165,100 sq mi).\n* Borneo peat swamp forests\n* *Kerangas* or Sundaland heath forests\n* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests are found in the island's western and southern lowlands\n* Sunda Shelf mangroves\n* The Borneo montane rain forests lie in the central highlands of the island, above the 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) elevation.\n* The highest elevations of Mount Kinabalu are home to the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows, a subalpine and alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.\n\n\nAccording to analysis of data from Global Forest Watch,[45] the Indonesian portion of Borneo lost 10.7 million hectares (26 million acres) of tree cover between 2002 and 2019, of which 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) was primary forest, compared with Malaysian Borneo's 4.4 million hectares (11 million acres) of tree cover loss and 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million acres) of primary forest cover loss. As of 2020, Indonesian Borneo accounts for 72% of the island's tree cover, Malaysian Borneo 27%, and Brunei 1%. Primary forest in Indonesia accounts for 44% of Borneo's overall tree cover.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Conservation issues[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Deforestation in Borneo, 1997 Indonesian forest fires, 1997 Southeast Asian haze, 2006 Southeast Asian haze, 2013 Southeast Asian haze, 2015 Southeast Asian haze, 2016 Southeast Asian haze, and 2019 Southeast Asian haze\n\n![](image)Logging near Crocker Range National Park. Borneo has lost more than half of its rainforests in the past half a century.[47]\nThe island historically had extensive rainforest cover, but the area was reduced due to heavy logging by the Indonesian and Malaysian wood industry, especially with the large demands of raw materials from industrial countries along with the conversion of forest lands for large-scale agricultural purposes.[42] Half of the annual global tropical timber acquisition comes from Borneo. Palm oil plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest.[48] Forest fires since 1997, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry El Niño season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest.[49] During these fires, hotspots were visible on satellite images and the resulting haze frequently affected Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia. The haze could also reach southern Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines as evidenced on the 2015 Southeast Asian haze.[50]\n\n\nA 2018 study found that Bornean orangutans declined by 148,500 individuals from 1999 to 2015.[51]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia, the highest summit of the island[22]\nList of highest peaks in Borneo by elevation.\n\n\n\n* Mount Kinabalu 13,435 ft (4,095 m)\n* Mount Trusmadi 8,668 ft (2,642 m)\n* Raya Hill 7.474 ft (2.278 m)\n* Muruk Miau 6,837 ft (2,084 m)\n* Mount Wakid 6,778 ft (2,066 m)\n* Monkobo Hill 5,866 ft (1,788 m)\n* Mount Lotung 5,843 ft (1,781 m)\n* Mount Magdalena 4,288 ft (1,307 m)\n* Talibu Hill 4,144 ft (1,263 m)\n\n\n### River systems[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kapuas River in Indonesia; at 1,000 km (620 mi) in length, it is the longest river in Borneo.[23]\nList of longest river in Borneo by length.\n\n\n\n* Kapuas River 1,143 km (710 mi)\n* Barito River 1,090 km (680 mi)\n* Mahakam River 980 km (610 mi)\n* Kahayan River 658 km (409 mi)\n* Mendawai River 616 km (383 mi)\n* Kayan River 576 km (358 mi)\n* Rajang River 565 km (351 mi)\n* Kinabatangan River 560 km (350 mi)\n* Baram River 400 km (250 mi)\n* Sembakung River 352 km (219 mi)\n* Sesayap River 279 km (173 mi)\n* Pawan River 197 km (122 mi)\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dayak, the main indigenous people in the island, were feared for their headhunting practices.\nIn November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Saléh on the island of Borneo.[52][53]\n\n\nAccording to ancient Chinese (977),[54]: 129 Indian and Japanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports by the first millennium AD.[55] In Chinese manuscripts, gold, camphor, tortoise shells, hornbill ivory, rhinoceros horn, crane crest, beeswax, lakawood (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick liana, *Dalbergia parviflora*), dragon's blood, rattan, edible bird's nests and various spices were described as among the most valuable items from Borneo.[56] The Indians named Borneo *Suvarnabhumi* (the land of gold) and also *Karpuradvipa* (Camphor Island). The Javanese named Borneo *Puradvipa*, or Diamond Island. Archaeological findings in the Sarawak river delta reveal that the area was a thriving centre of trade between India and China from the 6th century until about 1300.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territorial loss of the thalassocracy of the Sultanate of Brunei from 1400 to 1890 due to the beginning of Western imperialism\nStone pillars bearing inscriptions in the Pallava script, found in Kutai along the Mahakam River in East Kalimantan and dating to around the second half of the 4th century, constitute some of the oldest evidence of Hindu influence in Southeast Asia.[57] By the 14th century, Borneo became a vassal state of Majapahit (in present-day Indonesia),[58][59] later changing its allegiance to the Ming dynasty of China.[60] Pre-Islamic Sulu, then known locally as Lupah Sug, stretched from Palawan and the Sulu archipelago at the Philippines; to Sabah, Eastern, and Northern Kalimantan in Borneo.[61] The Sulu empire rose as a rebellion and reaction against former Majapahit Imperialism against Sulu which Majapahit briefly occupied. The religion of Islam entered the island in the 10th century,[62] following the arrival of Muslim traders who later converted many indigenous peoples in the coastal areas.[63]\n\n\nThe Sultanate of Brunei declared independence from Majapahit following the death of the Majapahit emperor in the mid-14th century. During its golden age under Bolkiah from the 15th to the 17th century, the Bruneian sultanate ruled almost the entire coastal area of Borneo (lending its name to the island due to its influence in the region) and several islands in the Philippines.[64] During the 1450s, Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr, an Arab born in Johor,[65] arrived in Sulu from Malacca. In 1457, he founded the Sultanate of Sulu; he titled himself as \"Paduka Maulana Mahasari Sharif Sultan Hashem Abu Bakr\".[66] Following its independence in 1578 from Brunei's influence,[67] Sulu began to expand its thalassocracy to parts of the northern Borneo.[68][69] Both the sultanates who ruled northern Borneo had traditionally engaged in trade with China by means of the frequently-arriving Chinese junks.[70][71] Despite the thalassocracy of the sultanates, Borneo's interior region remained free from the rule of any kingdoms.[72]\n\n\n\n### British and Dutch control[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Borneo and Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)British flag hoisted for the first time on the island of Labuan on 24 December 1846\nSince the fall of Malacca in 1511, Portuguese merchants traded regularly with Borneo, and especially with Brunei from 1530.[73] Having visited Brunei's capital, the Portuguese described the place as surrounded by a stone wall.[74] While Borneo was seen as rich, the Portuguese did not make any attempts to conquer it.[73] The Spanish had sailed from Latin America and conquered the Brunei's provinces in the Philippines and incorporated it into the Mexico-Centered Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Spanish visit to Brunei led to the Castilian War in 1578. The English began to trade with Sambas of southern Borneo in 1609, while the Dutch only began their trade in 1644: to Banjar and Martapura, also in the southern Borneo.[75] The Dutch tried to settle the island of Balambangan, north of Borneo, in the second half of the 18th century, but withdrew by 1797.[76] In 1812, the sultan in southern Borneo ceded his forts to the English East India Company. The English, led by Stamford Raffles, then tried to establish an intervention in Sambas but failed. Although they managed to defeat the sultanate the next year and declared a blockade on all ports in Borneo except Brunei, Banjarmasin and Pontianak, the project was cancelled by the British governor-general Lord Minto in India as it was too expensive.[76] At the beginning of British and Dutch exploration on the island, they described the island of Borneo as full of head hunters, with the indigenous in the interior practising cannibalism,[77] and the waters around the island infested with pirates, especially between the north eastern Borneo and the southern Philippines.[78][79] The Malay and Sea Dayak pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo,[80] along with the attacks by Illanuns of the Moro pirates from the southern Philippines, such as in the Battle off Mukah.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the island divided between the British and the Dutch, 1898. The present boundaries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei are largely inherited from the British and Dutch colonial rules.\nThe Dutch began to intervene in the southern part of the island upon resuming contact in 1815, posting *residents* to Banjarmasin, Pontianak and Sambas and *assistant-residents* to Landak and Mampawa.[82][83] The Sultanate of Brunei in 1842 granted large parts of land in Sarawak to the English adventurer James Brooke, as a reward for his help in quelling a local rebellion. Brooke established the Raj of Sarawak and was recognised as its rajah after paying a fee to the sultanate. He established a monarchy, and the Brooke dynasty (through his nephew and great-nephew) ruled Sarawak for 100 years; the leaders were known as the White Rajahs.[84][85] Brooke also acquired the island of Labuan for Great Britain in 1846 through the Treaty of Labuan with the sultan of Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddin II on 18 December 1846.[86] The region of northern Borneo came under the administration of North Borneo Chartered Company following the acquisition of territory from the Sultanates of Brunei and Sulu by a German businessman and adventurer named Baron von Overbeck, before it was passed to the British Dent brothers (comprising Alfred Dent and Edward Dent).[69][87] Further expansion by the British continued into the Borneo interior.[88] This led the 26th sultan of Brunei, Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin to appeal the British to halt such efforts, and as a result a Treaty of Protection was signed in 1888, rendering Brunei a British protectorate.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Dayak tribe during an Erau ceremony in Tenggarong\nBefore the acquisition by the British, the Americans also managed to establish their temporary presence in northwestern Borneo after acquiring a parcel of land from the Sultanate of Brunei. A company known as American Trading Company of Borneo was formed by Joseph William Torrey, Thomas Bradley Harris and several Chinese investors, establishing a colony named \"Ellena\" in the Kimanis area.[90] The colony failed and was abandoned, due to denials of financial backing, especially by the US government, and to diseases and riots among the workers.[91] Before Torrey left, he managed to sell the land to the German businessman, Overbeck.[92] Meanwhile, the Germans under William Frederick Schuck were awarded a parcel of land in northeastern Borneo of the Sandakan Bay from the Sultanate of Sulu where he conducted business and exported large quantities of arms, opium, textiles and tobacco to Sulu before the land was also passed to Overbeck by the sultanate.[93][94]\n\n\n\n![](image)Arab-Malay Sultan of Pontianak in 1930\nPrior to the recognition of Spanish presence in the Philippine archipelago, a protocol known as the Madrid Protocol of 1885 was signed between the governments of the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain in Madrid to cement Spanish influence and recognise their sovereignty over the Sultanate of Sulu—in return for Spain's relinquishing its claim to the former possessions of the sultanate in northern Borneo.[95][96] The British administration then established the first railway network in northern Borneo, known as the North Borneo Railway.[97][98] During this time, the British sponsored a large number of Chinese workers to migrate to northern Borneo to work in European plantation and mines,[99] and the Dutch followed suit to increase their economic production.[100] By 1888, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei in northern Borneo had become British protectorate.[101] The area in southern Borneo was made Dutch protectorate in 1891.[77] The Dutch who already claimed the whole Borneo were asked by Britain to delimit their boundaries between the two colonial territories to avoid further conflicts.[101] The British and Dutch governments had signed the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 to exchange trading ports in Malay Peninsula and Sumatra that were under their controls and assert spheres of influence. This resulted in indirectly establishing British- and Dutch-controlled areas in the north (Malay Peninsula) and south (Sumatra and Riau Islands) respectively.[102]\n\n\nIn 1895, Marcus Samuel received a concession in the Kutei area of east Borneo, and based on oil seepages in the Mahakam River delta, Mark Abrahams struck oil in February 1897. This was the discovery of the Sanga Sanga Oil Field, a refinery was built in Balikpapan, and discovery of the Samboja Oil Field followed in 1909. In 1901, the Pamusian Oil Field was discovered on Tarakan, and the Bunyu Oil Field in 1929. Royal Dutch Shell discovered the Miri Oil Field in 1910, and the Seria oil field in 1929.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Japanese occupation of British Borneo and Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies\n\n![](image)Japanese troops march through the streets of Labuan on 14 January 1942.\n![](image)American support craft moving towards Victoria and Brown beach to assist the landing of the members of Australian 24th Infantry Brigade on the island during Operation Oboe Six, 10 June 1945\nDuring World War II, Japanese forces gained control and occupied most areas of Borneo from 1941 to 1945. In the first stage of the war, the British saw the Japanese advance to Borneo as motivated by political and territorial ambitions rather than economic factors.[106] The occupation drove many people in the coastal towns to the interior, searching for food and escaping the Japanese.[107] The Chinese residents in Borneo, especially with the Sino-Japanese War in Mainland China mostly resisted the Japanese occupation.[108] Following the formation of resistance movements in northern Borneo such as the Jesselton Revolt, many innocent indigenous and Chinese people were executed by the Japanese for their alleged involvement.[109]\n\n\nIn Kalimantan, the Japanese also killed many Malay intellectuals, executing all the Malay sultans of West Kalimantan in the Pontianak incidents, together with Chinese people who were already against the Japanese for suspecting them to be threats.[110] Sultan Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II of Sambas was executed in 1944. The sultanate was thereafter suspended and replaced by a Japanese council.[111] The Japanese also set-up *Pusat Tenaga Rakjat* (PUTERA)[112] in the Indonesian archipelago in 1943, although it was abolished the following year when it became too nationalistic.[113] Some of the Indonesian nationalist like Sukarno and Hatta who had returned from Dutch exile began to co-operate with the Japanese. Shortly after his release, Sukarno became president of the Central Advisory Council, an advisory council for south Borneo, Celebes, and Lesser Sunda, set up in February 1945.[113]\n\n\nSince the fall of Singapore, the Japanese sent several thousand of British and Australian prisoners of war to camps in Borneo such as Batu Lintang camp. From the Sandakan camp site, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived after they were forced to march in an event known as the Sandakan Death March.[114] In addition, of the total of 17,488 Javanese labourers brought in by the Japanese during the occupation, only 1,500 survived mainly due to starvation, harsh working conditions and maltreatment.[107] The Dayak and other indigenous people played a role in guerrilla warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division. They temporarily revived headhunting of Japanese toward the end of the war,[115] with Allied Z Special Unit provided assistance to them.[116] Australia contributed significantly to the liberation of Borneo.[117] The Australian Imperial Force was sent to Borneo to fight off the Japanese.[118] Together with other Allies, the island was completely liberated in 1945.\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sukarno visiting Pontianak, West Kalimantan, in 1963\nIn May 1945, officials in Tokyo suggested that whether northern Borneo should be included in the proposed new country of Indonesia should be separately determined based on the desires of its indigenous people and following the disposition of Malaya.[119] Sukarno and Mohammad Yamin meanwhile continuously advocated for a Greater Indonesian republic.[120] Towards the end of the war, Japan decided to give an early independence to a new proposed country of Indonesia on 17 July 1945, with an Independence Committee meeting scheduled for 19 August 1945.[113] However, following the surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, the meeting was shelved. Sukarno and Hatta continued the plan by unilaterally declaring independence, although the Dutch tried to retake their colonial possession in Borneo.[113]\n\n\nThe southern part of the island achieved its independence through the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August 1945. The southern part saw guerrilla conflicts followed by Dutch blockade to cut supplies for nationalist within the region.[121] While nationalist guerrillas supporting the inclusion of southern Borneo in the new Indonesian republic were active in Ketapang, and to lesser extent in Sambas where they rallied with the red-white flag which became the flag of Indonesia, most of the Chinese residents in southern Borneo expected to be liberated by Chinese Nationalist troops from mainland China and to integrate their districts as an overseas province of China.[122] Meanwhile, Sarawak and Sabah in northern Borneo became separate British crown colonies in 1946.[123][124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Queen's Own Highlanders 1st Battalion conduct a patrol to search for enemy positions in the jungle of Brunei.\nIn 1961, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman of the independent Federation of Malaya desired to unite Malaya, the British colonies of Sarawak, North Borneo, Singapore and the protectorate of Brunei under the proposed Federation of Malaysia.[125] The idea was heavily opposed by the governments in both Indonesia and the Philippines as well from communist sympathisers and nationalists in Borneo.[126][127] Sukarno, as the president of the new republic, perceiving the British trying to maintain their presence in northern Borneo and the Malay Peninsula, decided to launch a military infiltration, later known as the *confrontation*, from 1962 to 1969.[128] As a response to the growing opposition, the British deployed their armed forces to guard their colonies against Indonesian and communist revolts,[129] which was also participated by Australia and New Zealand.[130][131]\n\n\nThe Philippines opposed the newly proposed federation, claiming the eastern part of North Borneo (today the Malaysian state of Sabah) as part of its territory as a former possession of the Sultanate of Sulu.[132] The Philippine government mostly based their claim on the Sultanate of Sulu's cession agreement with the British North Borneo Company, as by now the sultanate had come under the jurisdiction of the Philippine republican administration, which therefore should inherit the Sulu former territories. The Philippine government also claimed that the heirs of the sultanate had ceded all their territorial rights to the republic.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The proposed flag of the North Borneo Federation, an attempt to establish a sovereign state by unifying North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak by A. M. Azahari\nThe Sultanate of Brunei at the first welcomed the proposal of a new larger federation.[134] Meanwhile, the Brunei People's Party led by A.M. Azahari desired to reunify Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo into one federation known as the North Borneo Federation (Malay: *Kesatuan Negara Kalimantan Utara*), where the sultan of Brunei would be the head of state for the federation—though Azahari had his own intention to abolish the Brunei monarchy, to make Brunei more democratic, and to integrate the territory and other former British colonies in Borneo into Indonesia, with the support from the latter government.[135] This directly led to the Brunei Revolt, which thwarted Azahari's attempt and forced him to escape to Indonesia. Brunei withdrew from being part of the new Federation of Malaysia due to some disagreements on other issues while political leaders in Sarawak and North Borneo continued to favour inclusion in a larger federation.[136]\n\n\nWith the continuous opposition from Indonesia and the Philippines, the Cobbold Commission was established to discover the feeling of the native populations in northern Borneo; it found the people greatly in favour of federation, with various stipulations.[137][138] The federation was successfully achieved with the inclusion of northern Borneo through the Malaysia Agreement on 16 September 1963.[139] To this day, the area in northern Borneo is still subjected to attacks by Moro pirates since the 18th century and militant from groups such as Abu Sayyaf since 2000 in the frequent cross border attacks. During the administration of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, Marcos made some attempts to destabilise the state of Sabah,[140] although his plan failed and resulted in the Jabidah massacre and later the insurgency in the southern Philippines.[141][142]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Indonesian president Joko Widodo announced a plan to move the capital of Indonesia from Jakarta to a newly established location in the East Kalimantan province in Borneo.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nThe demonym for Borneo is **Bornean**.[144]\n\n\nBorneo had 23,053,723 inhabitants (in 2020 Censuses),[1][2] a population density of 30.8 inhabitants per square kilometre (80 inhabitants per square mile).

dependent on the oil and gas production sector, and the country has become one of the largest oil producers in Southeast Asia. The Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak are both top exporters of timber.[156] Sabah is also known as the agricultural producer of rubber, cacao, and vegetables, and for its fisheries, while Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan export liquefied natural gas (LNG) and petroleum.

The administrative area of the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (\"Antananarivo-Mother Hill\" or \"Antananarivo-Capital\"), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are based here.\n\n\nAntananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's 1,275,207 (2018 Census[2]) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All eighteen Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612–1630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a *rova* (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo (\"City of the Thousand\") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.\n\n\nThe city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina until 1710 when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo became the capital of the southern quadrant until 1794, when King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored it as the capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina, also bringing neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.\n\n\nThe city is now managed by the *Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo* (CUA) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation, Ny Havana Andriamanjato, appointed in March 2014. Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic, waste management, pollution, security, public water and electricity, and other challenges linked to explosive population growth. Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace, the tomb of Rainiharo, Tsimbazaza Zoo, Mahamasina Stadium, Lake Anosy, four 19th-century martyr churches, and the Museum of Art and Archaeology.\n\n\n\n\n## Pronunciation and etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe English pronunciation of Antananarivo is /ˌæntəˌnænəˈriːvoʊ/ or /ˌɑːntəˌnɑːnəˈriːvoʊ/.[3] The Malagasy pronunciation is [antananaˈrivʷ], and the pronunciation of the old French name Tananarive is /təˌnænəˈriːv/[4] or /ˌtænənəˈriːv/[5] in English and [tananaʁiv] in French.\n\n\nAntananarivo was originally the site of a town called *Analamanga*, meaning \"Blue Forest\" in the Central Highlands dialect of the Malagasy language.[6] Analamanga was established by a community of Vazimba, the island's first occupants. Merina King Andrianjaka, who migrated to the region from the southeast coast, seized the location as the site of his capital city. According to oral history, he deployed a garrison of 1,000 soldiers to successfully capture and guard the site.[6] The hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona, who renamed it *Antananarivo* (\"City of the Thousand\") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.[7]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Antananarivo\n\n### Kingdom of Imerina[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old city gate\nAntananarivo was already a major city before the colonial era. After expelling the Vazimba who inhabited the town at the peak of Analamanga hill, Andrianjaka chose the site for his *rova* (fortified royal compound), which expanded over time to enclose the royal palaces and the tombs of Merina royalty.[8] The city was established in around 1610[9] or 1625[10] according to varying accounts. Early Merina kings used *fanampoana* (statute labor) to construct a massive system of irrigated paddy fields and dikes around the city to provide adequate rice for the growing population. These paddy fields, of which the largest is called the Betsimitatatra, continue to produce rice.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sovereigns addressed the public at the historic town square of Andohalo.\nSuccessive Merina sovereigns ruled over the Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona's reign. This sovereign gave the growing city its current name; he established the Andohalo town square outside the town gate, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely.[7] Andriamasinavalona designated specific territories for the *hova* (commoners) and each *andriana* (noble) subcaste, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced; members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others.[12] Numerous *fady* (taboos), including injunctions against the construction of wooden houses by non-nobles[13] and the presence of swine within the city limits, were imposed.[14]\n\n\nUpon Andriamasinavalona's death in 1710, Imerina split into four warring quadrants, and Antananarivo was made the capital of the southern district.[15] During the 77-year civil war that followed, the eastern district's capital at Ambohimanga rose in prominence.[16] The last king of Ambohimanga, Andrianampoinimerina, successfully conquered Antananarivo in 1793;[17] he reunited the provinces of Imerina, ending the civil war. He moved the kingdom's political capital back to Antananarivo in 1794,[15] and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital, a role it still maintains.[18] Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely, establishing the city's economic center.[19]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Madagascar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Anosy was created in the 19th century to provide hydraulic power to industrial factories.\nBy the time Andrianampoinimerina's son Radama I had ascended the throne upon his father's death in 1810, Antananarivo was the largest and most economically important city on the island, with a population of over 80,000 inhabitants.[20] Radama opened the city to the first European settlers, artisan missionaries of the London Missionary Society (LMS) who arrived in 1820 and opened the city's first public schools.[21] James Cameron introduced brickmaking to the island and created Lake Anosy to generate hydraulic power for industrial manufacturing.[22] Radama established a military training ground on a flat plain called Mahamasina at the base of Analamanga near the lake. Radama's subjugation of other Malagasy ethnic groups brought nearly two-thirds of the island under his control. The British diplomats who concluded trade treaties with Radama recognized him as the \"ruler of Madagascar\", a position he and his successors claimed despite never managing to impose their authority over the larger portion of the island's south. Thereafter, Merina sovereigns declared Antananarivo the capital of the entire island.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ranavalona I built the staircases connecting the market at Analakely to Antaninarenina (pictured) and Ambondrona in 1832.[24]\nRadama's successor Ranavalona I invited a shipwrecked craftsman named Jean Laborde to construct the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and Manjakamiadana (built 1839–1841), the largest palace at the Rova. Laborde also produced a wide range of industrial products at factories in the highland village Mantasoa and a foundry in the Antananarivo neighborhood of Isoraka.[25] Ranavalona oversaw improvements to the city's infrastructure, including the construction of the city's two largest staircases at Antaninarenina and Ambondrona, which connect *la ville moyenne* (\"the middle town\") to the central marketplace at Analakely.[24] In 1867, following a series of fires in the capital, Queen Ranavalona II issued a royal decree that permitted the use of stone and brick construction in buildings other than tombs.[22] LMS missionaries' first brick house was built in 1869; it bore a blend of English, Creole, and Malagasy design and served as a model for a new style of house that rapidly spread throughout the capital and across the highlands. Termed the *trano gasy* (\"Malagasy house\"), it is typically a two-story, brick building with four columns on the front that support a wooden veranda. In the latter third of the 19th century, these houses quickly replaced most of the traditional wooden houses of the city's aristocratic class.[26] The growing number of Christians in Imerina prompted the construction of stone churches throughout the highlands, as well as four memorial churches on key sites of martyrdom among early Malagasy Christians under the reign of Ranavalona I.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony.\nUntil the mid-19th century, the city remained largely concentrated around the Rova of Antananarivo on the highest peak, an area today referred to as *la haute ville* or *la haute* (\"upper town\"). As the population grew, the city expanded to the west; by the late 19th century it extended to the northern hilltop neighborhood of Andohalo, an area of low prestige until British missionaries made it their preferred residential district and built one of the city's memorial churches here from 1863 to 1872.[6] From 1864 to 1894, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony governed Madagascar alongside three successive queens, Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III, effecting policies that further transformed the city. In 1881, he reinstated mandatory universal education first introduced in 1820 under Radama I, requiring the construction of numerous schools and colleges, including teacher training colleges staffed by missionaries and the nation's first pharmacy, medical college, and modern hospital.[28] Rainilaiarivony built the Andafiavaratra Palace in 1873 as his residence and office at a site near the royal palace.[29]\n\n\n\n### French Madagascar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The colonial French Residency serves today as a presidential office and has been renamed the Ambohitsorohitra Palace.\nThe French military invaded Antananarivo in September 1894, prompting the queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted a hole through a building at the Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo, walkways, and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive.[30] They chose Antaninarenina as the site for the French Governor General's Residency; upon independence, it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure was introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs at the foot of the hill, was brought from the Ikopa River.[31]\n\n\nThis period saw a major expansion of *la ville moyenne*, which spread along the lower hilltops and slopes of the city centered around the French residency. Modern urban planning was applied in *la ville basse* (\"lower town\"), which expanded from the base of the city's central hills into the surrounding rice fields. Major boulevards like *Avenue de l'Indépendance*, planned commercial areas like the arcades lining either side of the avenue, large parks, city squares, and other landmark features were built.[31] A railway system connecting Soarano station at one end of the *Avenue de l'Indépendance* in Antananarive with Toamasina and Fianarantsoa was established in 1897.[32] Beyond these planned spaces, neighborhoods densely populated by working-class Malagasy expanded without state oversight or control.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacarandas planted during the French colonial period bloom in October around Lake Anosy.\nThe city expanded rapidly after World War II;[31] by 1950 its population had grown to 175,000. Roads connecting Antananarivo to surrounding towns were expanded and paved. The first international airport was constructed at Arivonimamo, 45 km (28 mi) outside the city; this was replaced in 1967 with Ivato International Airport approximately 15 km (9 mi) from the city center. The University of Antananarivo was constructed in the Ankatso neighborhood and the Museum of Ethnology and Paleontology was also built. A city plan written in 1956 created suburban zones where large houses and gardens were established for the wealthy. In 1959, severe floods in *la ville basse* prompted the building of large-scale embankments along the edges of the Betsimitatatra rice fields and the establishment of new ministerial complexes on newly drained land in the Anosy neighborhood.[31]\n\n\n\n### Post-independence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate building\nAfter independence in 1960, the pace of growth increased further. The city's population reached 1.4 million by the end of the 20th century; in 2013, it was estimated at nearly 2.1 million.[33] Uncontrolled urban sprawl has challenged the city's infrastructure, producing shortages of clean water and electricity, sanitation and public health problems, and heavy traffic congestion.[31] There are more than 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral. Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes, including the 1972 *rotaka* that brought down President Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state.[34]\n\n\nThe 2022 Antananarivo floods hit the city in January of that year, causing multiple deaths and significant damage to almost 7,000 houses.[35]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Country 20 Miles around Antananarivo, Madagascar (LMS, 1869, p.44)[36]\nAntananarivo is situated approximately 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the Central Highlands region of Madagascar, at 18.55' South and 47.32' East.[37] The city is located centrally along the north–south axis of the country, and east of the center along the east–west axis. It is 160 km (99 mi) from the east coast and 330 km (210 mi) from the west coast. The city occupies a commanding position on the summit and slopes of a long, narrow, rocky ridge extending north and south for about 4 km (2 mi) and rising to about 200 m (660 ft) above the extensive rice fields to the west.[6]\n\n\nThe official boundaries of the city of Antananarivo encompass an urban area of approximately 86.4 km2 (33.4 sq mi).[37] It was founded 1,480 m (4,860 ft) above sea level at the apex of three hill ranges that converge in a Y form, 200 m (660 ft) above the surrounding Betsimitatatra paddy fields and the grassy plains beyond. The city gradually spread out from this central point to cover the hillsides; by the late 19th century it had expanded to the flat terrain at the base of the hills. These plains are susceptible to flooding during the rainy season; they are drained by the Ikopa River, which skirts the capital to the south and west. The western slopes and plains, being best protected from cyclone winds originating over the Indian Ocean, were settled before those to the east.[6]\n\n\nGreater Antananarivo is a continuous, urbanized area spreading beyond the city's official boundaries for 9 km (5.6 mi) north to south between Ambohimanarina and Ankadimbahoaka, and 6 km (3.7 mi) west to east between the Ikopa River dike and Tsiadana.[38] The population of the greater Antananarivo area was estimated at 3 million people in 2012; it is expected to rise to 6 million by 2030.[39]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, Antananarivo has a subtropical highland climate with dry season defined (*Cwb*)[40] characterized by mild, dry winters and warm, rainy summers.[37] The city receives nearly all of its average annual rainfall between November and April. Frosts are rare in the city; they are more common at higher elevations. Daily mean temperatures range from 20.8 °C (69.4 °F) in December to 14.3 °C (57.7 °F) in July.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Antananarivo (1991–2020)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 33.1(91.6)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 14.0(57.2)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 4.0(39.2)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 312.3(12.30)\n | 236.6(9.31)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 44.6(1.76)\n | 14.7(0.58)\n | 5.5(0.22)\n | 6.2(0.24)\n | 5.4(0.21)\n | 7.5(0.30)\n | 39.3(1.55)\n | 117.1(4.61)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 1,171.4(46.12)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 16.8\n | 14.3\n | 11.0\n | 4.4\n | 2.0\n | 1.4\n | 0.9\n | 1.1\n | 1.0\n | 4.3\n | 9.0\n | 13.6\n | 79.8\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 80\n | 79\n | 77\n | 77\n | 77\n | 76\n | 74\n | 70\n | 69\n | 71\n | 77\n | 76\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 210.5\n | 178.0\n | 199.1\n | 220.5\n | 228.8\n | 206.1\n | 213.9\n | 235.0\n | 249.5\n | 251.0\n | 232.7\n | 201.1\n | 2,626.2\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[41][42] |\n| Source 2: *Pogoda*[43] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The royal palace is built on the peak of Analamanga, the city's highest hill, which dominates its skyline.\nAntananarivo encompasses three ridges that intersect at their highest point. The Manjakamiadana royal palace is located at the summit of these hills and is visible from every part of the city and the surrounding hills. The Manjakamiadina was the largest structure within the rova of Antananarivo; its stone casing is the only remnant of the royal residences to survive a 1995 fire at the site. For 25 years, the roofless shell dominated the skyline; its west wall collapsed in 2004.[44] In 2009, the stone casing had been fully restored and the building was re-roofed. It is illuminated at night. Conservation and reconstruction work at the site is ongoing.[45] The city skyline is a jumble of colorful, historic houses and churches. More recent residential and commercial buildings and family rice fields occupy lower terrain throughout the capital. The Betsimitatatra and other rice fields surround the city.[46]\n\n\nThe city's neighborhoods emerge from historic ethnic, religious, and caste divisions. The assignment of certain neighborhoods to particular noble sub-castes under the Kingdom of Imerina established divisions; the highest-ranking nobles were typically assigned to neighborhoods closest to the royal palace and were required to live in higher elevation portions of the city.[47] During and after French colonization, the expansion of the city continued to reflect these divisions. Today, the *haute ville* is mainly residential and viewed as a prestigious area in which to live; many of the city's wealthiest and most influential Malagasy families live there.[47] The part of *la haute* closest to the Rova contains much of the city's pre-colonial heritage and is considered it's historic part.[48] It includes the royal palace, Andafiavaratra Palace—the former residence of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, Andohalo—the principal town square until 1897, a cathedral near Andohalo built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the city's most intact historic entrance gate and the 19th-century houses of Merina nobles.[46]\n\n\nUnder the Kingdom of Madagascar, the commoner class (*hova*) settled at the periphery of the noble districts,[47] gradually spreading along the slopes of the lower hills during the late 19th century. This *ville moyenne* became increasingly populous under French colonial authority, which targeted them for redesign and development. Today, the neighborhoods in the *ville moyenne* are densely populated and lively, containing residences, historic sites, and businesses. The neighborhood of Antaninarenina contains the historic Hôtel Colbert, numerous jewelers' shops and other luxury goods stores, and administrative offices. In addition to Antaninarenina, the principal neighborhoods of *la ville moyenne* are Ankadifotsy on the eastern hills and Ambatonakanga and Isoraka to the west, all of which are largely residential.[48] Isoraka has developed lively nightlife, with houses converted to upscale restaurants and inns. Isoraka also houses the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo (1833–1852), whose sons and later Prime Ministers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony are buried with him.[49] Bordering these neighborhoods are the commercial areas of Besarety and Andravoahangy.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)The city's historic Zoma market, established by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), was discontinued in 1997.\nThe commercial center of town, Analakely, is located on the valley floor between these two *ville moyenne* hill ranges.[48] King Andrianampoinimerina established the city's first marketplace[19] on the grounds today occupied by the market's tile-roofed pavilions, constructed in the 1930s.[44] Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (*Zoma*) as market day,[19] when merchants would erect stalls shaded with white parasols, which extended throughout the valley forming what has been called the largest open-air marketplace in the world.[50] The market caused traffic congestion and safety hazards prompting government officials to divide and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997.[51] The city's other main commercial and administrative neighborhoods, which spread out from Analakely and extend into the adjacent plain, were established by the French, who drained and filled in the extant rice fields and swampland to create much of the area's design and infrastructure. The *Avenue de l'Indépendance* runs from the gardens of Ambohijatovo south of the market pavilions, through Analakely to the city's railroad station at Soarano. To the west of Soarano lies the dense commercial district of Tsaralalana; it is the only district to be built on a grid[48] and is the center of the city's South Asian community.[52] Behoririka, to the east of Soarano, is built around a lake of the same name and abuts the sprawling Andravoahangy district at the eastern edge of the city. Antanimena borders Soarano and Behoririka to the north. A tunnel built by the French in the early 20th century cuts through the hillside; it connects Ambohijatovo with Ambanidia and other residential areas in the south of the city.[48]\n\n\nSince pre-colonial times the lower classes, including those descended from the slave class (*andevo*) and rural migrants, have occupied the flood-prone lower districts bordering the Betsimitatatra rice fields to the west of the city.[47] This area is connected to Analakely by a tunnel constructed by the French in the early 20th century. The tunnel opens toward Lake Anosy and the national Supreme Court buildings and provides access to the residential neighborhood of Mahamasina and its stadium. The bordering neighborhood of Anosy was developed in the 1950s to house most of the national ministries and the Senate.[48] Anosy, the planned residential district of *Soixante-Sept Hectares* (often abbreviated to \"67\") and the neighborhood of Isotry are among the city's most densely populated, crime-ridden and impoverished neighborhoods.[53] Approximately 40 percent of inhabitants with electricity in their homes in the *ville basse* obtain it illegally by splicing into city power lines. In these areas, houses are more vulnerable to fires, flooding, and landslides, which are often triggered by the annual cyclone season.[54]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nineteenth-century *trano gasy* houses predominate in the historic *haute ville*.\nBefore the mid-19th century, all houses and marketplaces in Antananarivo, and throughout Madagascar, were constructed of woods, grasses, reeds, and other plant-based materials viewed as appropriate for structures used by the living. Only family tombs were built from stone, an inert material viewed as appropriate to use for the dead. British missionaries introduced brick-making to the island in the 1820s, and French industrialist Jean Laborde used stone and brick to build his factories over the next few decades. It was not until the royal edict on construction materials was lifted in the 1860s that stone was used to encase the royal palace. Many aristocrats, inspired by the royal palace and the two-story, brick houses with wrapped verandas and divided interior spaces built by British missionaries, copied the British model for their own large homes in the *haute ville*. The model, known as *trano gasy* (\"Malagasy house\"), rapidly spread throughout the Central Highlands of Madagascar, where it remains the predominant house construction style.[55]\n\n\nSince 1993, the *Commune urbaine d'Antananarivo* (CUA) has increasingly sought to protect and restore the city's architectural and cultural heritage. In 2005, CUA authorities partnered with the city planners of the Île-de-France to develop the *Plan Vert – Plan Bleu* strategy for creating a classification system for *Zones de Protection du Patrimoine Architectural, Urbain et Paysager*, areas of the city benefiting from legal protection and financial support for their historic and cultural heritage. The plan, which is being implemented by the *Institut des Métiers de la Ville*, prevents the destruction of historic buildings and other structures, and establishes construction codes that ensure new structures follow historic aesthetics. It also provides for awareness-raising campaigns in favor of historic preservation and undertakes projects to restore dilapidated historic buildings and sites. Under this plan, 19th-century sites, like the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal and the second residence of Rainilaiarivony, have been renovated.[39]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAntananarivo has been the largest city on the island since at least the late 18th century when its population was estimated at 15,000.[30] By 1810, the population had grown to 80,000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war, forced labor, disease and harsh measures of justice, the population of Imerina fell from 750,000 to 130,000 during this period.[20] In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina, the population of Antananarivo had recovered to between 50,000 and 75,000; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns.[30] In 1950, Antananarivo's population was around 175,000.[31] By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1.4 million, and – while the city itself now has a population of 1,275,207 (at the 2018 Census)[2] – with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2.3 million in 2018.[33] The metropolitan area is thus home to approaching 10 percent of the island's 25.68 million residents. Rural migration to the capital propels this growth; the city's population exceeds that of the other five provincial capitals combined.[30]\n\n\nAs the historic capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally located in the homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 percent of the population and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture, and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas.[30] Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their *tanindrazana* (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.[56]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nDespite ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Domestic Security, crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009. Between 1994 and 1998, the city had an average of eight to twelve police officers for every 10,000 inhabitants; large cities typically have closer to fifteen.[54] Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime.[57] As of 2012[update], the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime. The recent increase in crime and the inadequate response from the CUA has prompted the growth of private security firms in the city.[54]\n\n\nThe Antanimora Prison is located in the Antanimora district of the city. The facility has a maximum capacity of 800 inmates and has been reported to be severely overcrowded, at times housing more than 4000 detainees.[58]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*L'Avenue de l'Indépendance*, the city's main thoroughfare, is bordered on both sides by shopping arcades built by the French in the 1930s.\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the Malagasy economy. The land is used for the cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks, and other traditional livelihoods. Access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply, and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.[37]\n\n\nIndustry accounts for around 13 percent of Madagascar's gross domestic product (GDP) and is largely concentrated in Antananarivo. Key industries include soap production, food and tobacco processing, brewing, textiles, and leather manufacturing, employing around 5.5 percent of the workforce.[47] The city's extensive infrastructure and its role as the economic center of the country make it a favorable location for large businesses. Business owners are drivers of growth for the city; in 2010, 60 percent of all new buildings in the country were located in Antananarivo, most of which were built for commercial purposes. Unemployment and poverty are also growing, fueled in part by an inadequately skilled and unprofessional workforce and the lack of a comprehensive national strategy for economic development since 2009. [54] Formal sector job growth has not kept pace with population growth, and many residents earn their livelihood in the informal sector as street vendors and laborers.[59] Under Ravalomanana, construction in the capital increased sharply; twelve new supermarkets were constructed in two years.[57]\n\n\nThe residents of urban areas—in particular Antananarivo—have been hardest hit by economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment, and the decline of the middle class was especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city.[47] In 2007, two-thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity,[60] while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or another motor vehicle.[61] Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants, and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps[60] and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines.[62] Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen.[63] The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food.[64] Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.[65]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nIn Antananarivo and throughout the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the *famadihana*, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs five to seven years after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's *lamba*-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends, and neighbors are invited to take part in the music, dancing, and feasting that accompanies the event. The *famadihana* is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.[66]\n\n\n\n### Historic sites and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Palais de Justice d'Ambatondrafandrana, Court of Justice located \"At the stone of Rafandrana\". The site contains the stone erected by the ancient king Rafandrana but is now the location of the Ionic column court, open on three sides per Radama's order that all trials be open to public view. Nearby is the Ampamarinana, \"Place of hurling\", a precipice where Christians were martyred in 1849.[67][68][69]\nThe city has numerous monuments, historic buildings, sites of significance, and traditions related to the customs and history of the Central Highlands people.[54] The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo. The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th-century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina, including items saved from the fire at the Rova. Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square, where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public. Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the extinct elephant bird. Other historic buildings include the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgment, the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous medicinal plant garden,[39] the recently renovated Soarano railroad station, four late 19th-century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market. Open-air markets include Le Pochard and the artisan market at Andravoahangy. The Museum of Art and Archaeology in the Isoraka neighborhood features exhibits on the history and cultures of Madagascar's diverse ethnic groups.[70] The Pirates Museum in Tsaralalàna explains the history of maritime pirates and the story of the pirates in Madagascar and their mysterious Republic of Libertalia.[71]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cinemas Rex and Ritz\nThe arts scene in Antananarivo is the largest and most vibrant in the country. Madagascar's diverse music is reflected in the many concerts, cabarets, dance clubs, and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo. In the dry season, outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the Antsahamanitra amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium.[72] Concerts and nightclubs are attended mainly by young people of the middle to upper classes who can afford the entrance fees.[72] More affordable are performances of traditional *vakindrazana* or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and *hira gasy* at the city's outdoor *cheminots* theater or *Alliance française*; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth.[73] Nightlife is the most animated in the *ville moyenne* neighborhoods of Antaninarenina, Tsaralalana, Behoririka, Mahamasina, and Andohalo.[74]\n\n\nThe *Palais des Sports* in the Mahamasina neighborhood is the country's only indoor performance space built to international standards. It was built in 1995 by the Government of China; it regularly hosts concerts, dance, and other arts performances, expositions, and novelty events like monster truck rallies. The city lacks a dedicated classical music performance space, and concerts by international artists are infrequent. Performances of classical, jazz, and other foreign musical genres, modern and contemporary dance, theater, and other arts occur at cultural arts centers funded by foreign governments or private entities. Among the best-known of these is the *Centre Culturel Albert Camus* and *Alliance française d'Antananarivo*, both funded by the French government.[72] the *Cercle Germano-Malgache*, a branch of the Goethe-Institut funded by the German government;[75] The American Center is funded by the United States government.[76] Antananarivo has two dedicated cinemas, the Rex and the Ritz, both of which were built in the colonial era. These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.[72]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nRugby Union is considered the national sport of Madagascar.[77] The national rugby team is nicknamed the Makis after the local word for the indigenous ring-tailed lemur. The team trains and plays domestic matches at Maki Stadium in Antananarivo. Constructed in 2012, the stadium has a capacity of 15,000 and houses a gym and administrative offices for the team.\n\n\nSeveral soccer teams are based in Antananarivo; AS Adema Analamanga and Ajesaia are associated with the Analamanga region; USCA Foot is associated with the CUA and the AS Saint Michel has been affiliated since 1948 with the historic secondary school of the same name. All four teams train and play local games in Mahamasina Municipal Stadium, the largest sporting venue in the country. The men's basketball teams Challenger and SOE (*Équipe du Stade olympique de l'Emyrne*) are based in Antananarivo and play in the *Palais des Sports* at Mahamasina.[78]\n\n\nThe sports facilities of the University of Antananarivo were used to host the official 2011 African Basketball Championship.\n\n\n\n## Places of worship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Antananarivo\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Malagasy Lutheran Church (Lutheran World Federation), Assemblies of God, Association of Bible Baptist Churches in Madagascar (Baptist World Alliance), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antananarivo (Catholic Church).[79] There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The new *Hôtel de Ville* was completed in 2009 and replaced the original town hall burned in the 1972 *rotaka* protests.\nAntananarivo is the capital of Madagascar, and the federal governance structures, including the Senate, National Assembly, the Supreme Court, and the presidential office are housed there. The main presidential offices are located 15 km (9.3 mi) south of the city. The city hosts diplomatic missions of 21 countries.[80]\n\n\nThe CUA is divided into six numbered *arrondissements* (administrative sub-districts); it has historically been administered by an elected mayor and associated staff.[37] Since the 2009 political crisis, in which the Mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, unconstitutionally seized power as head of state, the CUA has been administered by a *délégation spéciale* (special delegation) composed of a president and *de facto* mayor with the support of two vice presidents, all of whom are appointed by the president.[81] The position of President of the Special Delegation has been held by Ny Hasina Andriamanjato since March 2014.[82]\n\n\nThe mayoral administration of the CUA is empowered to govern the city with *de jure* autonomy; a wide range of mechanisms have been established to facilitate governance, although they are of limited effectiveness. An urban master plan guides major policies for city management but personnel within the mayoral office commonly lack the urban planning and management ability to effectively implement the plan in response to long-term and immediate needs. This challenge is compounded by the high turnover rate of mayors and staff that frequently disrupts initiatives begun by previous CUA administrations.[37] A mayor under former President Didier Ratsiraka created \"red zones\"; areas where public gathering and protests were prohibited. On 28 June 2001, Ravalomanana abolished these areas, liberalizing freedom of assembly.[83]\n\n\nAntananarivo has suffered from debt and mismanagement. The CUA estimated in 2012 that the cost of running the city to international standards would reach US$100 million annually, while annual revenues average around $12 million. In good years, the CUA can reserve $1–2 million to spend on city improvement projects.[39] By 2008, the city's treasury had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy *ariary*—approximately US$4.6 million—in debts under previous mayors.[84] In 2008, water was cut off at public pumps, and there were regular brownouts of city street lights because of 3.3 million ariary of unpaid debts to the Jirama public utility company by the City of Antananarivo. In response, Mayor Rajoelina undertook an audit that identified and sought to address long-standing procedural irregularities and corruption in the city's administration.[85] The CUA continues to be challenged by a shortage of revenues relative to its expenses caused by the high cost of retaining a large number of CUA personnel, weak structures for managing revenues from public rents and inadequate collection of tax revenues from city residents and businesses.[37]\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nAntananarivo has established sister city agreements with four cities. The city was twinned with Yerevan, Armenia in 1981.[86] The city is also twinned with Vorkuta, Russia;[87] Suzhou, China;[88] and Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[89] A sister city relationship between Antananarivo and Nice, France, established in 1962, is not active.[90] In 2019, the Mayor of the Commune Urbaine Antananarivo was inviting the City of Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia to enter into a sister relationship with the City of Antananarivo.[91]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Antananarivo was founded in 1958.\nMost of Madagascar's public and private universities are located in Antananarivo.[92] This includes the country's oldest higher education institute, the College of Medicine established under the Merina monarchy and the University of Antananarivo, established under the French colonial administration. The Centre National de Télé-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is located in Antananarivo.[93] The city hosts many private pre-primary, primary and secondary schools and the national network of public schools.[94] The city houses multiple French international schools, including Lycée Français de Tananarive, Lycée La Clairefontaine, Lycée Peter Pan,[95] and École de l'Alliance française d'Antsahabe.[96] It also houses an American school, American School of Antananarivo, and a Russian school, the Russian Embassy School in Antananarivo (Russian: основная общеобразовательная школа при Посольстве России на Мадагаскаре).[97]\n\n\nThe nation's most prestigious dance school, *K'art Antanimena*, is located in Antananarivo. Other major dance schools based in the city include *Le Club de Danse de l'Université Catholique de Madagascar*, *Club de danse Kera arts'space à Antanimena* and *Le Club Mills*.[78]\n\n\n\n## Health and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nIn general, the availability and quality of health care are better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there.[98] Neonatal[99] and antenatal care are significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island.[100] Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, the high cost of health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.[101]\n\n\nThe large population in Antananarivo and the high density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation, and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste are inadequate. Wastewater is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhaust, residential coal-burning stoves, and other sources is worsening.[54] While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, with poor access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city.[54] Antananarivo is one of the two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.[102]\n\n\nIn 2017, Antananarivo was ranked as the 7th worst city for particulate-matter air pollution in the world.[103][104]\n\n\nThese problems were diminished but not eliminated under the mayoral administration of Marc Ravalomanana, who prioritized sanitation, security, and public administration. He obtained funds from international donors to establish garbage collection and disposal systems, restore dilapidated infrastructures such as roads and marketplaces, and replanted public gardens.[105] To improve sanitation in the city, he constructed public latrines in densely populated and highly frequented areas.[106]\n\n\n\n## Transport and communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Soarano train station is located at the end of *L'Avenue de l'Indépendance*.\nThe majority of the city's residents move about Antananarivo on foot. The CUA sets and enforces rules that govern a system of 2,400 franchised private minibuses running on 82 numbered routes throughout the city. An additional 2,000 minibuses managed by the Ministry of Transportation run along 8 lines into the neighboring suburbs. These interlinked bus systems served around 700,000 passengers each day.[39] These minibuses often fail to meet safety standards or air quality requirements and are typically overcrowded with passengers and their cargo. Police and *gendarmes* assist in regulating traffic at peak periods in the morning and evening, or around special events and holidays. Private licensed and unlicensed taxis are common; most vehicles are older Renaults or Citroens. Newer vehicles congregate near hotels and other locales frequented by foreigners willing or able to pay higher prices for better services.[39]\n\n\nThe city is encircled by a ring road and connected by direct *routes nationales* (national highways) to Mahajanga, Toliara, Antsirabe, Fianarantsoa and Toamasina. Branches and feeder roads from these major highways connect the city to the national road network. Antananarivo was connected by train to Toamasina to the east and Manakara to the southeast via Antsirabe and Fianarantsoa, but since 2019 passenger trains have not been operated anymore. The city's principal railway station is centrally located at Soarano at one end of the *Avenue de l'Indépendance*. Ivato International Airport is located approximately 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the center of the city, connecting Antananarivoto to all national airports. Ivato is the hub of the national airline Air Madagascar,[31] and is the only airport on the island hosting long-haul carriers. Direct flights connect Antananarivo to cities in South Africa and Europe.[107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Newspaper vendor\nGovernment television and radio broadcasting centers, and the headquarters of numerous private stations are located in Antananarivo. Eighty percent of households in Antananarivo own a radio; the medium is popular across social classes. Stations like *Fenon'ny Merina* appeal to Merina listeners of all ages by playing traditional and contemporary music of the highlands region. Youth-oriented stations play a blend of Western artists and Malagasy performers of Western genres, as well as fusion and coastal musical styles. Evangelical broadcasts and daily international and local news are available in Malagasy, French, and English.[108] Forty percent of Antananarivo residents own a television receiver.[109] All major Malagasy newspapers are printed in the city and are widely available. Communications services in Antananarivo are the best in the country. Internet and mobile telephone networks are readily available and affordable, although service disruptions occur periodically. The national postal service is headquartered in Antananarivo, and private international shipping companies like FedEx, DHL Express, and United Parcel Service provide services to the city.[110]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Lucile Allorge (born 1937), botanist\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Institut National de la Statistique Madagascar (web)\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Institut National de la Statistique, Madagascar.\n3. **^** Dictionary.com: Antananarivo\n4. **^** Dictionary.com: Tananarive\n5. **^** Oxford Dictionary: Tananarive (American English)\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Shillington 2004, p. 158.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Callet 1908, pp. 654–656.\n8. **^** Government of France 1898, pp. 918–919.\n9. **^** Desmonts 2004, pp. 114–115.\n10. **^** Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, *Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture*, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 15\n11. **^** Callet 1908, p. 522.\n12. **^** Callet 1908, pp. 563–565.\n13. **^** Acquier 1997, pp. 63–64.\n14. **^** Oliver 1886, p. 221.\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Royal Hill of Ambohimanga\".

The administrative area of the city, known as Antananarivo-Renivohitra (\"Antananarivo-Mother Hill\" or \"Antananarivo-Capital\"), is the capital of Analamanga region. The city sits at 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the center of the island, the highest national capital by elevation among the island countries. It has been the country's largest population center since at least the 18th century. The presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located there, as are 21 diplomatic missions and the headquarters of many national and international businesses and NGOs. It has more universities, nightclubs, art venues, and medical services than any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis are based here.\n\n\nAntananarivo was historically the capital of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's 1,275,207 (2018 Census[2]) inhabitants. The surrounding urban areas have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All eighteen Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are represented in the city. It was founded circa 1610, when the Merina King Andrianjaka (1612–1630) expelled the Vazimba inhabitants of the village of Analamanga. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a *rova* (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. The city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it Antananarivo (\"City of the Thousand\") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.\n\n\nThe city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina until 1710 when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. Antananarivo became the capital of the southern quadrant until 1794, when King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored it as the capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina, also bringing neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests continued under his son, Radama I, who eventually controlled over two-thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats. Antananarivo remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897, and after independence in 1960.\n\n\nThe city is now managed by the *Commune Urbaine d'Antananarivo* (CUA) under the direction of its President of the Special Delegation, Ny Havana Andriamanjato, appointed in March 2014. Limited funds and mismanagement have hampered consecutive CUA efforts to manage overcrowding and traffic, waste management, pollution, security, public water and electricity, and other challenges linked to explosive population growth. Major historic landmarks and attractions in the city include the reconstructed royal palaces and the Andafiavaratra Palace, the tomb of Rainiharo, Tsimbazaza Zoo, Mahamasina Stadium, Lake Anosy, four 19th-century martyr churches, and the Museum of Art and Archaeology.\n\n\n\n\n## Pronunciation and etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe English pronunciation of Antananarivo is /ˌæntəˌnænəˈriːvoʊ/ or /ˌɑːntəˌnɑːnəˈriːvoʊ/.[3] The Malagasy pronunciation is [antananaˈrivʷ], and the pronunciation of the old French name Tananarive is /təˌnænəˈriːv/[4] or /ˌtænənəˈriːv/[5] in English and [tananaʁiv] in French.\n\n\nAntananarivo was originally the site of a town called *Analamanga*, meaning \"Blue Forest\" in the Central Highlands dialect of the Malagasy language.[6] Analamanga was established by a community of Vazimba, the island's first occupants. Merina King Andrianjaka, who migrated to the region from the southeast coast, seized the location as the site of his capital city. According to oral history, he deployed a garrison of 1,000 soldiers to successfully capture and guard the site.[6] The hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona, who renamed it *Antananarivo* (\"City of the Thousand\") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers.[7]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Antananarivo\n\n### Kingdom of Imerina[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old city gate\nAntananarivo was already a major city before the colonial era. After expelling the Vazimba who inhabited the town at the peak of Analamanga hill, Andrianjaka chose the site for his *rova* (fortified royal compound), which expanded over time to enclose the royal palaces and the tombs of Merina royalty.[8] The city was established in around 1610[9] or 1625[10] according to varying accounts. Early Merina kings used *fanampoana* (statute labor) to construct a massive system of irrigated paddy fields and dikes around the city to provide adequate rice for the growing population. These paddy fields, of which the largest is called the Betsimitatatra, continue to produce rice.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sovereigns addressed the public at the historic town square of Andohalo.\nSuccessive Merina sovereigns ruled over the Kingdom of Imerina from Analamanga through King Andriamasinavalona's reign. This sovereign gave the growing city its current name; he established the Andohalo town square outside the town gate, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely.[7] Andriamasinavalona designated specific territories for the *hova* (commoners) and each *andriana* (noble) subcaste, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced; members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others.[12] Numerous *fady* (taboos), including injunctions against the construction of wooden houses by non-nobles[13] and the presence of swine within the city limits, were imposed.[14]\n\n\nUpon Andriamasinavalona's death in 1710, Imerina split into four warring quadrants, and Antananarivo was made the capital of the southern district.[15] During the 77-year civil war that followed, the eastern district's capital at Ambohimanga rose in prominence.[16] The last king of Ambohimanga, Andrianampoinimerina, successfully conquered Antananarivo in 1793;[17] he reunited the provinces of Imerina, ending the civil war. He moved the kingdom's political capital back to Antananarivo in 1794,[15] and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital, a role it still maintains.[18] Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely, establishing the city's economic center.[19]\n\n\n\n### Kingdom of Madagascar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Anosy was created in the 19th century to provide hydraulic power to industrial factories.\nBy the time Andrianampoinimerina's son Radama I had ascended the throne upon his father's death in 1810, Antananarivo was the largest and most economically important city on the island, with a population of over 80,000 inhabitants.[20] Radama opened the city to the first European settlers, artisan missionaries of the London Missionary Society (LMS) who arrived in 1820 and opened the city's first public schools.[21] James Cameron introduced brickmaking to the island and created Lake Anosy to generate hydraulic power for industrial manufacturing.[22] Radama established a military training ground on a flat plain called Mahamasina at the base of Analamanga near the lake. Radama's subjugation of other Malagasy ethnic groups brought nearly two-thirds of the island under his control. The British diplomats who concluded trade treaties with Radama recognized him as the \"ruler of Madagascar\", a position he and his successors claimed despite never managing to impose their authority over the larger portion of the island's south. Thereafter, Merina sovereigns declared Antananarivo the capital of the entire island.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ranavalona I built the staircases connecting the market at Analakely to Antaninarenina (pictured) and Ambondrona in 1832.[24]\nRadama's successor Ranavalona I invited a shipwrecked craftsman named Jean Laborde to construct the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and Manjakamiadana (built 1839–1841), the largest palace at the Rova. Laborde also produced a wide range of industrial products at factories in the highland village Mantasoa and a foundry in the Antananarivo neighborhood of Isoraka.[25] Ranavalona oversaw improvements to the city's infrastructure, including the construction of the city's two largest staircases at Antaninarenina and Ambondrona, which connect *la ville moyenne* (\"the middle town\") to the central marketplace at Analakely.[24] In 1867, following a series of fires in the capital, Queen Ranavalona II issued a royal decree that permitted the use of stone and brick construction in buildings other than tombs.[22] LMS missionaries' first brick house was built in 1869; it bore a blend of English, Creole, and Malagasy design and served as a model for a new style of house that rapidly spread throughout the capital and across the highlands. Termed the *trano gasy* (\"Malagasy house\"), it is typically a two-story, brick building with four columns on the front that support a wooden veranda. In the latter third of the 19th century, these houses quickly replaced most of the traditional wooden houses of the city's aristocratic class.[26] The growing number of Christians in Imerina prompted the construction of stone churches throughout the highlands, as well as four memorial churches on key sites of martyrdom among early Malagasy Christians under the reign of Ranavalona I.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony.\nUntil the mid-19th century, the city remained largely concentrated around the Rova of Antananarivo on the highest peak, an area today referred to as *la haute ville* or *la haute* (\"upper town\"). As the population grew, the city expanded to the west; by the late 19th century it extended to the northern hilltop neighborhood of Andohalo, an area of low prestige until British missionaries made it their preferred residential district and built one of the city's memorial churches here from 1863 to 1872.[6] From 1864 to 1894, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony governed Madagascar alongside three successive queens, Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III, effecting policies that further transformed the city. In 1881, he reinstated mandatory universal education first introduced in 1820 under Radama I, requiring the construction of numerous schools and colleges, including teacher training colleges staffed by missionaries and the nation's first pharmacy, medical college, and modern hospital.[28] Rainilaiarivony built the Andafiavaratra Palace in 1873 as his residence and office at a site near the royal palace.[29]\n\n\n\n### French Madagascar[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The colonial French Residency serves today as a presidential office and has been renamed the Ambohitsorohitra Palace.\nThe French military invaded Antananarivo in September 1894, prompting the queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted a hole through a building at the Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo, walkways, and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained Antananarivo as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive.[30] They chose Antaninarenina as the site for the French Governor General's Residency; upon independence, it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure was introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs at the foot of the hill, was brought from the Ikopa River.[31]\n\n\nThis period saw a major expansion of *la ville moyenne*, which spread along the lower hilltops and slopes of the city centered around the French residency. Modern urban planning was applied in *la ville basse* (\"lower town\"), which expanded from the base of the city's central hills into the surrounding rice fields. Major boulevards like *Avenue de l'Indépendance*, planned commercial areas like the arcades lining either side of the avenue, large parks, city squares, and other landmark features were built.[31] A railway system connecting Soarano station at one end of the *Avenue de l'Indépendance* in Antananarive with Toamasina and Fianarantsoa was established in 1897.[32] Beyond these planned spaces, neighborhoods densely populated by working-class Malagasy expanded without state oversight or control.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jacarandas planted during the French colonial period bloom in October around Lake Anosy.\nThe city expanded rapidly after World War II;[31] by 1950 its population had grown to 175,000. Roads connecting Antananarivo to surrounding towns were expanded and paved. The first international airport was constructed at Arivonimamo, 45 km (28 mi) outside the city; this was replaced in 1967 with Ivato International Airport approximately 15 km (9 mi) from the city center. The University of Antananarivo was constructed in the Ankatso neighborhood and the Museum of Ethnology and Paleontology was also built. A city plan written in 1956 created suburban zones where large houses and gardens were established for the wealthy. In 1959, severe floods in *la ville basse* prompted the building of large-scale embankments along the edges of the Betsimitatatra rice fields and the establishment of new ministerial complexes on newly drained land in the Anosy neighborhood.[31]\n\n\n\n### Post-independence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate building\nAfter independence in 1960, the pace of growth increased further. The city's population reached 1.4 million by the end of the 20th century; in 2013, it was estimated at nearly 2.1 million.[33] Uncontrolled urban sprawl has challenged the city's infrastructure, producing shortages of clean water and electricity, sanitation and public health problems, and heavy traffic congestion.[31] There are more than 5,000 church buildings in the city and its suburbs, including an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral. Antananarivo is the see city of Madagascar's Roman Catholic Archdiocese. The city has repeatedly been the site of large demonstrations and violent political clashes, including the 1972 *rotaka* that brought down President Philibert Tsiranana and the 2009 Malagasy political crisis, which resulted in Andry Rajoelina replacing Marc Ravalomanana as head of state.[34]\n\n\nThe 2022 Antananarivo floods hit the city in January of that year, causing multiple deaths and significant damage to almost 7,000 houses.[35]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Country 20 Miles around Antananarivo, Madagascar (LMS, 1869, p.44)[36]\nAntananarivo is situated approximately 1,280 m (4,199 ft) above sea level in the Central Highlands region of Madagascar, at 18.55' South and 47.32' East.[37] The city is located centrally along the north–south axis of the country, and east of the center along the east–west axis. It is 160 km (99 mi) from the east coast and 330 km (210 mi) from the west coast. The city occupies a commanding position on the summit and slopes of a long, narrow, rocky ridge extending north and south for about 4 km (2 mi) and rising to about 200 m (660 ft) above the extensive rice fields to the west.[6]\n\n\nThe official boundaries of the city of Antananarivo encompass an urban area of approximately 86.4 km2 (33.4 sq mi).[37] It was founded 1,480 m (4,860 ft) above sea level at the apex of three hill ranges that converge in a Y form, 200 m (660 ft) above the surrounding Betsimitatatra paddy fields and the grassy plains beyond. The city gradually spread out from this central point to cover the hillsides; by the late 19th century it had expanded to the flat terrain at the base of the hills. These plains are susceptible to flooding during the rainy season; they are drained by the Ikopa River, which skirts the capital to the south and west. The western slopes and plains, being best protected from cyclone winds originating over the Indian Ocean, were settled before those to the east.[6]\n\n\nGreater Antananarivo is a continuous, urbanized area spreading beyond the city's official boundaries for 9 km (5.6 mi) north to south between Ambohimanarina and Ankadimbahoaka, and 6 km (3.7 mi) west to east between the Ikopa River dike and Tsiadana.[38] The population of the greater Antananarivo area was estimated at 3 million people in 2012; it is expected to rise to 6 million by 2030.[39]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, Antananarivo has a subtropical highland climate with dry season defined (*Cwb*)[40] characterized by mild, dry winters and warm, rainy summers.[37] The city receives nearly all of its average annual rainfall between November and April. Frosts are rare in the city; they are more common at higher elevations. Daily mean temperatures range from 20.8 °C (69.4 °F) in December to 14.3 °C (57.7 °F) in July.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Antananarivo (1991–2020)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 33.1(91.6)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 14.0(57.2)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 4.0(39.2)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 4.4(39.9)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.0(42.8)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 312.3(12.30)\n | 236.6(9.31)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 44.6(1.76)\n | 14.7(0.58)\n | 5.5(0.22)\n | 6.2(0.24)\n | 5.4(0.21)\n | 7.5(0.30)\n | 39.3(1.55)\n | 117.1(4.61)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 1,171.4(46.12)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 16.8\n | 14.3\n | 11.0\n | 4.4\n | 2.0\n | 1.4\n | 0.9\n | 1.1\n | 1.0\n | 4.3\n | 9.0\n | 13.6\n | 79.8\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 80\n | 79\n | 77\n | 77\n | 77\n | 76\n | 74\n | 70\n | 69\n | 71\n | 77\n | 76\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 210.5\n | 178.0\n | 199.1\n | 220.5\n | 228.8\n | 206.1\n | 213.9\n | 235.0\n | 249.5\n | 251.0\n | 232.7\n | 201.1\n | 2,626.2\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA[41][42] |\n| Source 2: *Pogoda*[43] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The royal palace is built on the peak of Analamanga, the city's highest hill, which dominates its skyline.\nAntananarivo encompasses three ridges that intersect at their highest point. The Manjakamiadana royal palace is located at the summit of these hills and is visible from every part of the city and the surrounding hills. The Manjakamiadina was the largest structure within the rova of Antananarivo; its stone casing is the only remnant of the royal residences to survive a 1995 fire at the site. For 25 years, the roofless shell dominated the skyline; its west wall collapsed in 2004.[44] In 2009, the stone casing had been fully restored and the building was re-roofed. It is illuminated at night. Conservation and reconstruction work at the site is ongoing.[45] The city skyline is a jumble of colorful, historic houses and churches. More recent residential and commercial buildings and family rice fields occupy lower terrain throughout the capital. The Betsimitatatra and other rice fields surround the city.[46]\n\n\nThe city's neighborhoods emerge from historic ethnic, religious, and caste divisions. The assignment of certain neighborhoods to particular noble sub-castes under the Kingdom of Imerina established divisions; the highest-ranking nobles were typically assigned to neighborhoods closest to the royal palace and were required to live in higher elevation portions of the city.[47] During and after French colonization, the expansion of the city continued to reflect these divisions. Today, the *haute ville* is mainly residential and viewed as a prestigious area in which to live; many of the city's wealthiest and most influential Malagasy families live there.[47] The part of *la haute* closest to the Rova contains much of the city's pre-colonial heritage and is considered it's historic part.[48] It includes the royal palace, Andafiavaratra Palace—the former residence of Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, Andohalo—the principal town square until 1897, a cathedral near Andohalo built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the city's most intact historic entrance gate and the 19th-century houses of Merina nobles.[46]\n\n\nUnder the Kingdom of Madagascar, the commoner class (*hova*) settled at the periphery of the noble districts,[47] gradually spreading along the slopes of the lower hills during the late 19th century. This *ville moyenne* became increasingly populous under French colonial authority, which targeted them for redesign and development. Today, the neighborhoods in the *ville moyenne* are densely populated and lively, containing residences, historic sites, and businesses. The neighborhood of Antaninarenina contains the historic Hôtel Colbert, numerous jewelers' shops and other luxury goods stores, and administrative offices. In addition to Antaninarenina, the principal neighborhoods of *la ville moyenne* are Ankadifotsy on the eastern hills and Ambatonakanga and Isoraka to the west, all of which are largely residential.[48] Isoraka has developed lively nightlife, with houses converted to upscale restaurants and inns. Isoraka also houses the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo (1833–1852), whose sons and later Prime Ministers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony are buried with him.[49] Bordering these neighborhoods are the commercial areas of Besarety and Andravoahangy.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)The city's historic Zoma market, established by King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810), was discontinued in 1997.\nThe commercial center of town, Analakely, is located on the valley floor between these two *ville moyenne* hill ranges.[48] King Andrianampoinimerina established the city's first marketplace[19] on the grounds today occupied by the market's tile-roofed pavilions, constructed in the 1930s.[44] Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (*Zoma*) as market day,[19] when merchants would erect stalls shaded with white parasols, which extended throughout the valley forming what has been called the largest open-air marketplace in the world.[50] The market caused traffic congestion and safety hazards prompting government officials to divide and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997.[51] The city's other main commercial and administrative neighborhoods, which spread out from Analakely and extend into the adjacent plain, were established by the French, who drained and filled in the extant rice fields and swampland to create much of the area's design and infrastructure. The *Avenue de l'Indépendance* runs from the gardens of Ambohijatovo south of the market pavilions, through Analakely to the city's railroad station at Soarano. To the west of Soarano lies the dense commercial district of Tsaralalana; it is the only district to be built on a grid[48] and is the center of the city's South Asian community.[52] Behoririka, to the east of Soarano, is built around a lake of the same name and abuts the sprawling Andravoahangy district at the eastern edge of the city. Antanimena borders Soarano and Behoririka to the north. A tunnel built by the French in the early 20th century cuts through the hillside; it connects Ambohijatovo with Ambanidia and other residential areas in the south of the city.[48]\n\n\nSince pre-colonial times the lower classes, including those descended from the slave class (*andevo*) and rural migrants, have occupied the flood-prone lower districts bordering the Betsimitatatra rice fields to the west of the city.[47] This area is connected to Analakely by a tunnel constructed by the French in the early 20th century. The tunnel opens toward Lake Anosy and the national Supreme Court buildings and provides access to the residential neighborhood of Mahamasina and its stadium. The bordering neighborhood of Anosy was developed in the 1950s to house most of the national ministries and the Senate.[48] Anosy, the planned residential district of *Soixante-Sept Hectares* (often abbreviated to \"67\") and the neighborhood of Isotry are among the city's most densely populated, crime-ridden and impoverished neighborhoods.[53] Approximately 40 percent of inhabitants with electricity in their homes in the *ville basse* obtain it illegally by splicing into city power lines. In these areas, houses are more vulnerable to fires, flooding, and landslides, which are often triggered by the annual cyclone season.[54]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nineteenth-century *trano gasy* houses predominate in the historic *haute ville*.\nBefore the mid-19th century, all houses and marketplaces in Antananarivo, and throughout Madagascar, were constructed of woods, grasses, reeds, and other plant-based materials viewed as appropriate for structures used by the living. Only family tombs were built from stone, an inert material viewed as appropriate to use for the dead. British missionaries introduced brick-making to the island in the 1820s, and French industrialist Jean Laborde used stone and brick to build his factories over the next few decades. It was not until the royal edict on construction materials was lifted in the 1860s that stone was used to encase the royal palace. Many aristocrats, inspired by the royal palace and the two-story, brick houses with wrapped verandas and divided interior spaces built by British missionaries, copied the British model for their own large homes in the *haute ville*. The model, known as *trano gasy* (\"Malagasy house\"), rapidly spread throughout the Central Highlands of Madagascar, where it remains the predominant house construction style.[55]\n\n\nSince 1993, the *Commune urbaine d'Antananarivo* (CUA) has increasingly sought to protect and restore the city's architectural and cultural heritage. In 2005, CUA authorities partnered with the city planners of the Île-de-France to develop the *Plan Vert – Plan Bleu* strategy for creating a classification system for *Zones de Protection du Patrimoine Architectural, Urbain et Paysager*, areas of the city benefiting from legal protection and financial support for their historic and cultural heritage. The plan, which is being implemented by the *Institut des Métiers de la Ville*, prevents the destruction of historic buildings and other structures, and establishes construction codes that ensure new structures follow historic aesthetics. It also provides for awareness-raising campaigns in favor of historic preservation and undertakes projects to restore dilapidated historic buildings and sites. Under this plan, 19th-century sites, like the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal and the second residence of Rainilaiarivony, have been renovated.[39]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nAntananarivo has been the largest city on the island since at least the late 18th century when its population was estimated at 15,000.[30] By 1810, the population had grown to 80,000 before declining dramatically between 1829 and 1842 during the reigns of Radama I and especially Ranavalona I. Because of a combination of war, forced labor, disease and harsh measures of justice, the population of Imerina fell from 750,000 to 130,000 during this period.[20] In the final years of the Kingdom of Imerina, the population of Antananarivo had recovered to between 50,000 and 75,000; most of the population were slaves who were largely captured in provincial military campaigns.[30] In 1950, Antananarivo's population was around 175,000.[31] By the late 1990s the population of the metropolitan area had reached 1.4 million, and – while the city itself now has a population of 1,275,207 (at the 2018 Census)[2] – with suburbs lying outside the city limits it had grown to almost 2.3 million in 2018.[33] The metropolitan area is thus home to approaching 10 percent of the island's 25.68 million residents. Rural migration to the capital propels this growth; the city's population exceeds that of the other five provincial capitals combined.[30]\n\n\nAs the historic capital of Imerina, Antananarivo is centrally located in the homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 percent of the population and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture, and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas.[30] Most Antananarivo residents have strong ties to their *tanindrazana* (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.[56]\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nDespite ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Domestic Security, crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009. Between 1994 and 1998, the city had an average of eight to twelve police officers for every 10,000 inhabitants; large cities typically have closer to fifteen.[54] Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime.[57] As of 2012[update], the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime. The recent increase in crime and the inadequate response from the CUA has prompted the growth of private security firms in the city.[54]\n\n\nThe Antanimora Prison is located in the Antanimora district of the city. The facility has a maximum capacity of 800 inmates and has been reported to be severely overcrowded, at times housing more than 4000 detainees.[58]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*L'Avenue de l'Indépendance*, the city's main thoroughfare, is bordered on both sides by shopping arcades built by the French in the 1930s.\nAgriculture is the mainstay of the Malagasy economy. The land is used for the cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks, and other traditional livelihoods. Access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply, and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.[37]\n\n\nIndustry accounts for around 13 percent of Madagascar's gross domestic product (GDP) and is largely concentrated in Antananarivo. Key industries include soap production, food and tobacco processing, brewing, textiles, and leather manufacturing, employing around 5.5 percent of the workforce.[47] The city's extensive infrastructure and its role as the economic center of the country make it a favorable location for large businesses. Business owners are drivers of growth for the city; in 2010, 60 percent of all new buildings in the country were located in Antananarivo, most of which were built for commercial purposes. Unemployment and poverty are also growing, fueled in part by an inadequately skilled and unprofessional workforce and the lack of a comprehensive national strategy for economic development since 2009. [54] Formal sector job growth has not kept pace with population growth, and many residents earn their livelihood in the informal sector as street vendors and laborers.[59] Under Ravalomanana, construction in the capital increased sharply; twelve new supermarkets were constructed in two years.[57]\n\n\nThe residents of urban areas—in particular Antananarivo—have been hardest hit by economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread impoverishment, and the decline of the middle class was especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city.[47] In 2007, two-thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity,[60] while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or another motor vehicle.[61] Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants, and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps[60] and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines.[62] Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen.[63] The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food.[64] Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.[65]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nIn Antananarivo and throughout the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the *famadihana*, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs five to seven years after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's *lamba*-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk shrouds and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends, and neighbors are invited to take part in the music, dancing, and feasting that accompanies the event. The *famadihana* is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.[66]\n\n\n\n### Historic sites and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Palais de Justice d'Ambatondrafandrana, Court of Justice located \"At the stone of Rafandrana\". The site contains the stone erected by the ancient king Rafandrana but is now the location of the Ionic column court, open on three sides per Radama's order that all trials be open to public view. Nearby is the Ampamarinana, \"Place of hurling\", a precipice where Christians were martyred in 1849.[67][68][69]\nThe city has numerous monuments, historic buildings, sites of significance, and traditions related to the customs and history of the Central Highlands people.[54] The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo. The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th-century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina, including items saved from the fire at the Rova. Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square, where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public. Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the extinct elephant bird. Other historic buildings include the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgment, the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous medicinal plant garden,[39] the recently renovated Soarano railroad station, four late 19th-century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market. Open-air markets include Le Pochard and the artisan market at Andravoahangy. The Museum of Art and Archaeology in the Isoraka neighborhood features exhibits on the history and cultures of Madagascar's diverse ethnic groups.[70] The Pirates Museum in Tsaralalàna explains the history of maritime pirates and the story of the pirates in Madagascar and their mysterious Republic of Libertalia.[71]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cinemas Rex and Ritz\nThe arts scene in Antananarivo is the largest and most vibrant in the country. Madagascar's diverse music is reflected in the many concerts, cabarets, dance clubs, and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo. In the dry season, outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the Antsahamanitra amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium.[72] Concerts and nightclubs are attended mainly by young people of the middle to upper classes who can afford the entrance fees.[72] More affordable are performances of traditional *vakindrazana* or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and *hira gasy* at the city's outdoor *cheminots* theater or *Alliance française*; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth.[73] Nightlife is the most animated in the *ville moyenne* neighborhoods of Antaninarenina, Tsaralalana, Behoririka, Mahamasina, and Andohalo.[74]\n\n\nThe *Palais des Sports* in the Mahamasina neighborhood is the country's only indoor performance space built to international standards. It was built in 1995 by the Government of China; it regularly hosts concerts, dance, and other arts performances, expositions, and novelty events like monster truck rallies. The city lacks a dedicated classical music performance space, and concerts by international artists are infrequent. Performances of classical, jazz, and other foreign musical genres, modern and contemporary dance, theater, and other arts occur at cultural arts centers funded by foreign governments or private entities. Among the best-known of these is the *Centre Culturel Albert Camus* and *Alliance française d'Antananarivo*, both funded by the French government.[72] the *Cercle Germano-Malgache*, a branch of the Goethe-Institut funded by the German government;[75] The American Center is funded by the United States government.[76] Antananarivo has two dedicated cinemas, the Rex and the Ritz, both of which were built in the colonial era. These venues do not show international releases but occasionally screen Malagasy films or are used for private events and religious services.[72]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nRugby Union is considered the national sport of Madagascar.[77] The national rugby team is nicknamed the Makis after the local word for the indigenous ring-tailed lemur. The team trains and plays domestic matches at Maki Stadium in Antananarivo. Constructed in 2012, the stadium has a capacity of 15,000 and houses a gym and administrative offices for the team.\n\n\nSeveral soccer teams are based in Antananarivo; AS Adema Analamanga and Ajesaia are associated with the Analamanga region; USCA Foot is associated with the CUA and the AS Saint Michel has been affiliated since 1948 with the historic secondary school of the same name. All four teams train and play local games in Mahamasina Municipal Stadium, the largest sporting venue in the country. The men's basketball teams Challenger and SOE (*Équipe du Stade olympique de l'Emyrne*) are based in Antananarivo and play in the *Palais des Sports* at Mahamasina.[78]\n\n\nThe sports facilities of the University of Antananarivo were used to host the official 2011 African Basketball Championship.\n\n\n\n## Places of worship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Antananarivo\nAmong the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples : Church of Jesus Christ in Madagascar (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Malagasy Lutheran Church (Lutheran World Federation), Assemblies of God, Association of Bible Baptist Churches in Madagascar (Baptist World Alliance), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Antananarivo (Catholic Church).[79] There are also Muslim mosques.\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The new *Hôtel de Ville* was completed in 2009 and replaced the original town hall burned in the 1972 *rotaka* protests.\nAntananarivo is the capital of Madagascar, and the federal governance structures, including the Senate, National Assembly, the Supreme Court, and the presidential office are housed there. The main presidential offices are located 15 km (9.3 mi) south of the city. The city hosts diplomatic missions of 21 countries.[80]\n\n\nThe CUA is divided into six numbered *arrondissements* (administrative sub-districts); it has historically been administered by an elected mayor and associated staff.[37] Since the 2009 political crisis, in which the Mayor of Antananarivo, Andry Rajoelina, unconstitutionally seized power as head of state, the CUA has been administered by a *délégation spéciale* (special delegation) composed of a president and *de facto* mayor with the support of two vice presidents, all of whom are appointed by the president.[81] The position of President of the Special Delegation has been held by Ny Hasina Andriamanjato since March 2014.[82]\n\n\nThe mayoral administration of the CUA is empowered to govern the city with *de jure* autonomy; a wide range of mechanisms have been established to facilitate governance, although they are of limited effectiveness. An urban master plan guides major policies for city management but personnel within the mayoral office commonly lack the urban planning and management ability to effectively implement the plan in response to long-term and immediate needs. This challenge is compounded by the high turnover rate of mayors and staff that frequently disrupts initiatives begun by previous CUA administrations.[37] A mayor under former President Didier Ratsiraka created \"red zones\"; areas where public gathering and protests were prohibited. On 28 June 2001, Ravalomanana abolished these areas, liberalizing freedom of assembly.[83]\n\n\nAntananarivo has suffered from debt and mismanagement. The CUA estimated in 2012 that the cost of running the city to international standards would reach US$100 million annually, while annual revenues average around $12 million. In good years, the CUA can reserve $1–2 million to spend on city improvement projects.[39] By 2008, the city's treasury had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy *ariary*—approximately US$4.6 million—in debts under previous mayors.[84] In 2008, water was cut off at public pumps, and there were regular brownouts of city street lights because of 3.3 million ariary of unpaid debts to the Jirama public utility company by the City of Antananarivo. In response, Mayor Rajoelina undertook an audit that identified and sought to address long-standing procedural irregularities and corruption in the city's administration.[85] The CUA continues to be challenged by a shortage of revenues relative to its expenses caused by the high cost of retaining a large number of CUA personnel, weak structures for managing revenues from public rents and inadequate collection of tax revenues from city residents and businesses.[37]\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nAntananarivo has established sister city agreements with four cities. The city was twinned with Yerevan, Armenia in 1981.[86] The city is also twinned with Vorkuta, Russia;[87] Suzhou, China;[88] and Montreal, Quebec, Canada.[89] A sister city relationship between Antananarivo and Nice, France, established in 1962, is not active.[90] In 2019, the Mayor of the Commune Urbaine Antananarivo was inviting the City of Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia to enter into a sister relationship with the City of Antananarivo.[91]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Antananarivo was founded in 1958.\nMost of Madagascar's public and private universities are located in Antananarivo.[92] This includes the country's oldest higher education institute, the College of Medicine established under the Merina monarchy and the University of Antananarivo, established under the French colonial administration. The Centre National de Télé-Enseignement de Madagascar (CNETMAD) is located in Antananarivo.[93] The city hosts many private pre-primary, primary and secondary schools and the national network of public schools.[94] The city houses multiple French international schools, including Lycée Français de Tananarive, Lycée La Clairefontaine, Lycée Peter Pan,[95] and École de l'Alliance française d'Antsahabe.[96] It also houses an American school, American School of Antananarivo, and a Russian school, the Russian Embassy School in Antananarivo (Russian: основная общеобразовательная школа при Посольстве России на Мадагаскаре).[97]\n\n\nThe nation's most prestigious dance school, *K'art Antanimena*, is located in Antananarivo. Other major dance schools based in the city include *Le Club de Danse de l'Université Catholique de Madagascar*, *Club de danse Kera arts'space à Antanimena* and *Le Club Mills*.[78]\n\n\n\n## Health and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nIn general, the availability and quality of health care are better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there.[98] Neonatal[99] and antenatal care are significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island.[100] Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, the high cost of health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.[101]\n\n\nThe large population in Antananarivo and the high density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation, and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste are inadequate. Wastewater is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhaust, residential coal-burning stoves, and other sources is worsening.[54] While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, with poor access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city.[54] Antananarivo is one of the two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.[102]\n\n\nIn 2017, Antananarivo was ranked as the 7th worst city for particulate-matter air pollution in the world.[103][104]\n\n\nThese problems were diminished but not eliminated under the mayoral administration of Marc Ravalomanana, who prioritized sanitation, security, and public administration. He obtained funds from international donors to establish garbage collection and disposal systems, restore dilapidated infrastructures such as roads and marketplaces, and replanted public gardens.[105] To improve sanitation in the city, he constructed public latrines in densely populated and highly frequented areas.[106]\n\n\n\n## Transport and communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Soarano train station is located at the end of *L'Avenue de l'Indépendance*.\nThe majority of the city's residents move about Antananarivo on foot. The CUA sets and enforces rules that govern a system of 2,400 franchised private minibuses running on 82 numbered routes throughout the city. An additional 2,000 minibuses managed by the Ministry of Transportation run along 8 lines into the neighboring suburbs. These interlinked bus systems served around 700,000 passengers each day.[39] These minibuses often fail to meet safety standards or air quality requirements and are typically overcrowded with passengers and their cargo. Police and *gendarmes* assist in regulating traffic at peak periods in the morning and evening, or around special events and holidays. Private licensed and unlicensed taxis are common; most vehicles are older Renaults or Citroens. Newer vehicles congregate near hotels and other locales frequented by foreigners willing or able to pay higher prices for better services.[39]\n\n\nThe city is encircled by a ring road and connected by direct *routes nationales* (national highways) to Mahajanga, Toliara, Antsirabe, Fianarantsoa and Toamasina. Branches and feeder roads from these major highways connect the city to the national road network. Antananarivo was connected by train to Toamasina to the east and Manakara to the southeast via Antsirabe and Fianarantsoa, but since 2019 passenger trains have not been operated anymore. The city's principal railway station is centrally located at Soarano at one end of the *Avenue de l'Indépendance*. Ivato International Airport is located approximately 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the center of the city, connecting Antananarivoto to all national airports. Ivato is the hub of the national airline Air Madagascar,[31] and is the only airport on the island hosting long-haul carriers. Direct flights connect Antananarivo to cities in South Africa and Europe.[107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Newspaper vendor\nGovernment television and radio broadcasting centers, and the headquarters of numerous private stations are located in Antananarivo. Eighty percent of households in Antananarivo own a radio; the medium is popular across social classes. Stations like *Fenon'ny Merina* appeal to Merina listeners of all ages by playing traditional and contemporary music of the highlands region. Youth-oriented stations play a blend of Western artists and Malagasy performers of Western genres, as well as fusion and coastal musical styles. Evangelical broadcasts and daily international and local news are available in Malagasy, French, and English.[108] Forty percent of Antananarivo residents own a television receiver.[109] All major Malagasy newspapers are printed in the city and are widely available. Communications services in Antananarivo are the best in the country. Internet and mobile telephone networks are readily available and affordable, although service disruptions occur periodically. The national postal service is headquartered in Antananarivo, and private international shipping companies like FedEx, DHL Express, and United Parcel Service provide services to the city.[110]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Lucile Allorge (born 1937), botanist\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Institut National de la Statistique Madagascar (web)\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Institut National de la Statistique, Madagascar.\n3. **^** Dictionary.com: Antananarivo\n4. **^** Dictionary.com: Tananarive\n5. **^** Oxford Dictionary: Tananarive (American English)\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Shillington 2004, p. 158.\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Callet 1908, pp. 654–656.\n8. **^** Government of France 1898, pp. 918–919.\n9. **^** Desmonts 2004, pp. 114–115.\n10. **^** Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, *Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture*, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 15\n11. **^** Callet 1908, p. 522.\n12. **^** Callet 1908, pp. 563–565.\n13. **^** Acquier 1997, pp. 63–64.\n14. **^** Oliver 1886, p. 221.\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Royal Hill of Ambohimanga\".

It was known as **Frobisher Bay** from 1942 to 1987, after the large bay on the coast on which the city is situated. The northernmost city in Canada, its traditional Inuktitut name was restored in 1987.\n\n\nIn 1999, Iqaluit was designated the capital of Nunavut after the division of the Northwest Territories into two separate territories. Before this event, Iqaluit was a small city and not well known outside the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensive imported supplies, as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road or rail, and only has ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city has a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island—this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, although it is well south of the Arctic Circle.\n\n\nAs of the 2021 Canadian census, the population was 7,429[5] (population centre: 6,991[6]), a decrease of 4.0 per cent from the 2016 census. Iqaluit has the lowest population of any capital city in Canada. Inhabitants of Iqaluit are called *Iqalummiut* (singular: *Iqalummiuq*).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIqaluit has been a traditional fishing location used by Inuit and their predecessors, the Paleo-Eskimo (Dorset culture) and Thule, for thousands of years.[9][10] The name, *Iqaluit,* comes from Inuktitut Iqaluit (ᐃᖃᓗᐃᑦ) which means *place of many fish*.[8]\n\n\nWorld War II resulted in an influx of non-Inuit to the area in 1942, when the United States built Frobisher Bay Air Base there, on a long-term lease from the Government of Canada, in order to provide a stop-over and refuelling site for the short-range aircraft being ferried to Europe to support the war effort. Iqaluit's first permanent resident was Nakasuk, an Inuk guide who helped United States Army Air Forces planners to choose a site with a large flat area suitable for a landing strip. The wartime airstrip was known as Crystal Two, was part of the Crimson Route and operates today as Iqaluit Airport.\n\n\nIt had long been used as a campsite and fishing spot by the Inuit, who called it *Iqaluit* – \"place of many fish\" in Inuktitut. The US and Canadian authorities named it *Frobisher Bay*, after the name of the body of water it borders.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations to Apex in 1949 (pictured in 2005) to take advantage of the nearby airfield.\nIn 1949, after the war, the Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations to the neighbouring valley of *Niaqunngut*, officially called Apex, in order to use the airfield. In the mid-1950s, the population of Frobisher Bay increased rapidly during the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW line), a system of defensive radar stations—see North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\n\n\nHundreds of mostly non-Inuit construction workers, military personnel, and administrative staff moved into the community, and several hundred Inuit followed, to take advantage of the access to jobs and medical care provided by the base operations. By 1957, 489 of the town's 1,200 residents were reported to be Inuit. After 1959, the Canadian government established permanent services at Frobisher Bay, including full-time doctors, a school, and social services. The Inuit population grew rapidly in response, as the government encouraged Inuit to settle permanently in communities supported by government services.\n\n\nNaval Radio Station (NRS) Frobisher Bay (HMCS Frobisher Bay), callsign CFI, was established in July 1954 as a result of the closure of NRS Chimo, Quebec. Station CFI was part of the Supplementary Radio network. Because of its remoteness and size, it was very expensive to operate. Renamed CFS Frobisher Bay in 1966, advancing technology eventually forced the closure of CFI later that year.[11]\n\n\nThe American military left Iqaluit in 1963, as their development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) diminished the strategic value of the DEW line and Arctic airbases. Canada continued to operate an administrative and logistical centre for much of the eastern Arctic at Frobisher Bay. In 1964, the first local elections were held for a community council, and in 1979 for the first mayor. The founding of the Gordon Robertson Educational Centre, now Inuksuk High School, in the early 1970s at Iqaluit confirmed the government's commitment to the community as an administrative centre. At the time of its founding, this was the sole high school operating in what constituted more than one-seventh of Canadian territory.\n\n\nOn 1 January 1987, the name of the municipality was changed from \"Frobisher Bay\" to \"Iqaluit\" – aligning official usage with the name that the Inuit population had always used. (Many documents were made that referred to Iqaluit as Frobisher Bay for several years after 1987). In the non-binding 1995 Nunavut capital plebiscite, held 11 December, the residents of what would become the new territory selected Iqaluit (over Rankin Inlet) to serve as the future capital. On 19 April 2001, it was designated a city.\n\n\nCanada designated Iqaluit as the host city for the 2010 meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers, held on 5–6 February.[12] The requirements for the international meeting strained the northern communications technology infrastructure and required supplemental investment.[13]\n\n\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n* 1576 – Englishman Martin Frobisher sails into Frobisher Bay believing he has found the westward route to China.

He is the first Pope to visit Nunavut.[17]\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit is situated on the Everett Mountains\nIqaluit is the northernmost city in Canada, at 63 degrees north of the Equator. Iqaluit is located in the Everett Mountains, which rise from Koojesse Inlet,[14] an inlet of Frobisher Bay, on the southeast part of Baffin Island. It is well to the east of Nunavut's mainland, and northeast of Hudson Bay.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit has a tundra climate, featuring long, cold winters, and brief summers that are too cool to permit the growth of large trees.\nIqaluit has a tundra climate (Köppen: *ET*) typical of the Arctic region, although it is well outside the Arctic Circle. The city features long, cold winters and brief, cool summers. Average monthly temperatures are below freezing for eight months of the year.[18] Iqaluit averages just over 400 mm (16 in) of precipitation annually, much wetter than many other localities in the Arctic Archipelago, with the summer being the wettest season. Temperatures of the winter months are comparable to other northern communities further west on the continent such as Yellowknife and to some extent even Fairbanks, Alaska, even though Iqaluit is a few degrees colder than the latter. Summer temperatures are, however, much colder due to its easterly maritime position affected by the waters of the cold Baffin Island Current. This means that the tree line is much further south in the eastern part of Canada, being as southbound, in spite of low elevation, as northern Labrador.[19]\n\n\nAlthough it is north of the natural tree line, there are some short, south-facing imported black spruce (*Picea mariana*) specimens protected by snowdrifts in the winter,[20] in addition to a few shrubs, which are woody plants. These include the Arctic willow (*Salix arctica*). The Arctic willow may be up to around 7.6 m (25 ft) horizontally, but only 150 mm (6 in) tall.\n\n\nThe climate of Iqaluit is also colder than Gulf Stream locations on the same latitude. For example, the Norwegian city of Trondheim has an annual mean temperature that is 15.2 °C (27.4 °F) milder.\n\n\nThe lowest temperature ever recorded was −45.6 °C (−50.1 °F) on 10 February 1967.[18] The highest temperature ever recorded in Iqaluit was 26.8 °C (80.2 °F) on 21 July 2008.[21]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Iqaluit (Iqaluit Airport)WMO ID: 71909; coordinates 63°45′N 68°33′W﻿ / ﻿63.750°N 68.550°W﻿ / 63.750; -68.550﻿ (Iqaluit Airport); elevation: 33.5 m (110 ft); 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1946–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high humidex | 3.3\n | 5.2\n | 4.3\n | 6.8\n | 13.3\n | 21.7\n | 27.8\n | 27.6\n | 18.8\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 3.4\n | 27.8\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 7.2(45.0)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −22.0(−7.6)\n | −22.9(−9.2)\n | −17.6(0.3)\n | −8.9(16.0)\n | −0.3(31.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −14.7(5.5)\n | −4.9(23.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −26.0(−14.8)\n | −27.0(−16.6)\n | −22.4(−8.3)\n | −13.5(7.7)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | −11.1(12.0)\n | −18.9(−2.0)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −29.9(−21.8)\n | −31.0(−23.8)\n | −27.2(−17.0)\n | −18.1(−0.6)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −5.8(21.6)\n | −14.7(5.5)\n | −23.0(−9.4)\n | −12.2(10.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −45.0(−49.0)\n | −45.6(−50.1)\n | −44.7(−48.5)\n | −34.2(−29.6)\n | −26.1(−15.0)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −2.5(27.5)\n | −12.8(9.0)\n | −27.1(−16.8)\n | −36.2(−33.2)\n | −43.4(−46.1)\n | −45.6(−50.1)\n |\n| Record low wind chill | −65.4\n | −65.6\n | −62.1\n | −53.1\n | −36.0\n | −18.8\n | −7.2\n | −8.6\n | −18.6\n | −42.9\n | −56.8\n | −60.1\n | −65.6\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 14.0(0.55)\n | 21.4(0.84)\n | 22.7(0.89)\n | 21.0(0.83)\n | 48.7(1.92)\n | 39.8(1.57)\n | 61.7(2.43)\n | 50.8(2.00)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 18.5(0.73)\n | 16.2(0.64)\n | 361.2(14.22)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 0.4(0.02)\n | 0.1(0.00)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 46.1(1.81)\n | 44.4(1.75)\n | 65.5(2.58)\n | 43.9(1.73)\n | 12.3(0.48)\n | 0.7(0.03)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 216.6(8.53)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 19.4(7.6)\n | 15.1(5.9)\n | 20.6(8.1)\n | 23.8(9.4)\n | 23.0(9.1)\n | 3.8(1.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.0)\n | 8.5(3.3)\n | 21.1(8.3)\n | 25.9(10.2)\n | 28.8(11.3)\n | 190.0(74.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 12.1\n | 10.7\n | 12.4\n | 12.8\n | 10.6\n | 12.3\n | 12.4\n | 14.3\n | 15.7\n | 13.2\n | 12.5\n | 12.8\n | 151.5\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 0.06\n | 0.06\n | 0.06\n | 0.06\n | 1.7\n | 10.7\n | 13.1\n | 14.8\n | 13.2\n | 3.8\n | 0.24\n | 0.0\n | 57.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.2 cm) | 10.1\n | 8.8\n | 8.7\n | 9.6\n | 8.7\n | 2.1\n | 0.06\n | 0.12\n | 3.7\n | 9.8\n | 11.9\n | 12.7\n | 86.3\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%) (at 3pm) | 68.1\n | 67.6\n | 68.9\n | 74.6\n | 77.3\n | 74.6\n | 72.9\n | 73.5\n | 75.2\n | 78.7\n | 78.4\n | 74.3\n | 73.7\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 32.4\n | 94.0\n | 172.2\n | 216.5\n | 180.5\n | 200.2\n | 236.8\n | 156.8\n | 87.9\n | 51.4\n | 35.6\n | 12.6\n | 1,476.8\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 18.5\n | 39.0\n | 47.4\n | 48.2\n | 31.9\n | 32.5\n | 39.3\n | 31.0\n | 22.4\n | 16.8\n | 17.7\n | 8.9\n | 29.5\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 4\n | 4\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Source 1: Environment and Climate Change Canada[22] (Bright Sunshine 1981–2010)[18] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas[23] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skyline of Downtown, the central business district of Iqaluit.\n### Neighbourhoods[edit]\n\n\n* Downtown (central)\n* Happy Valley (north)\n* Lake Subdivision (north) – residential area\n* Lower Base (south)\n* Lower Iqaluit (southeast)\n* North 40 (northwest) – located on the north side of the airport\n* Plateau Subdivision (northwest) – residential area\n* Road To Nowhere (north)\n* Tundra Valley (west)\n* Tundra Ridge (west) – home to two of the city's schools and youth centre\n* West 40 (southwest) – commercial area\n\n![](image)View of Apex, a suburban neighbourhood of Iqaluit.\n### Suburbs[edit]\n\n\nApex (Niaqunngut), officially and functionally part of the City of Iqaluit, is a small community about 5 km (3.1 mi) southeast (63°43′20″N 068°26′56″W﻿ / ﻿63.72222°N 68.44889°W﻿ / 63.72222; -68.44889﻿ (Apex)[24]) from Iqaluit's centre and is known in Inuktitut as *Niaqunngut*. It is located on a small peninsula separating Koojesse Inlet from Tarr Inlet. There is a women's shelter, a church, a primary school (Nanook Elementary School), a design shop and a bed and breakfast in the community. Apex was where most Inuit lived when Iqaluit was a military site and off-limits to anyone not working at the base.\n\n\n\n### Architecture and attractions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2016)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Legislative Building of Nunavut is a distinctive building in Iqaluit.\nMuch of Iqaluit's architecture is functional—designed to minimize material costs, while retaining heat and withstanding the climate. Early architecture runs from the 1950s military barracks of the original DEW line installation, through the 1970s white hyper-modernist fibreglass block of the Nakasuk School and Municipal Offices and Arena, to the lines of the steel-reinforced concrete high-rise complex on the hill above it. A number of older Hudson's Bay Company and early 1950s buildings have been retained and restored in Apex (the former nursing station has been revived as the Rannva Bed and Breakfast, the HBC buildings as an art gallery). The newer buildings are more colourful and diverse, and closer to the norms of southern architecture.\n\n\nThe principal exception is the Nunavut Legislative Assembly Building, which is remarkable for its colourful interior, adorned with some of the very best in Inuit art. A new legislative building is in planning to be developed and built outside the city on the Apex Road.\n\n\n\n![](image)Shaped like an igloo, St. Jude's Cathedral is the seat of the Anglican Diocese of The Arctic.\nAnother distinctive building was St. Jude's Anglican Cathedral, see of the Anglican Diocese of The Arctic, which was a white building shaped like an igloo. The altar was built by the parishioners, under the guidance of Markoosie Peter, a traditional master carpenter. It was shaped like a traditional Inuit sled, and the cross composed of two crossed narwhal tusks. An incident of arson severely affected the Cathedral structure and interior on 5 November 2005,[25] and it was demolished on 1 June 2006. The cathedral is slowly being rebuilt (foundation 2008 superstructure 2010) and fund-raising continues locally and internationally. In December 2010, the exterior of a similarly shaped replacement cathedral was completed, and interior work was planned for 2011 with a potential opening for Christmas 2011. The current building, informally referred to as the Igloo Cathedral, was opened on 3 June 2012. The unique building, in the shape of an igloo, has traditionally been a landmark and tourist attraction in Iqaluit, besides its important spiritual role for Iqalummiut (people of Iqaluit).\n\n\nOn a ridge overlooking the city is the distinctive blue and white Inuksuk High School. The school is made up of four square sections joined that give a cloverleaf shape when viewed from the air.\n\n\nThe city is also the location of the Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum, which houses a large collection of Inuit and Arctic objects. The museum is housed in a restored and extended Hudson's Bay Company building, clad in the HBC signature red and white, transported to Iqaluit from its original site on the Apex Beach.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sylvia Grinnell River in Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park. The territorial park is located just outside the city limits.\nJust west of Iqaluit is the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park. This park is dominated by the valley of the Sylvia Grinnell River. A small visitor's centre with viewing platform is located on top of a hill overlooking scenic waterfalls, tidal flats and traditional fishing sites.\n\n\nNearby on an island near Peterhead Inlet, is the Qaummaarviit Territorial Park. It is a site with a long Inuit history and numerous artifacts have been recovered, including the remains of 11 semi-buried sod houses.\n\n\nA little farther, across Frobisher Bay, are the Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve and the Soper River, a Canadian Heritage River, forming a park corridor linking Iqaluit along traditional overland travel routes with Kimmirut (formerly Lake Harbour). Frobisher Bay extends for almost 110 km (70 mi) to the east, with moderate hills, glaciers and traditional and summer camp sites, opening into the Davis Strait which divides Nunavut from Greenland.\n\n\nIqaluit, like many Nunavut communities, has a volunteer-run annual spring festival. Called Toonik Tyme it involves a combination of traditional Inuit activities combined with more modern events, while the Alianait Music and Arts Festival is held for a week each 21 June.[26] The festival has attracted Canadian and international artists such as Joshua Haulli,[27] Quantum Tangle,[28] Washboard Hank[29] and Namgar.[30]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFederal census population history of Iqaluit| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971 | 2,050 | —     |\n| 1976 | 2,320 | +13.2% |\n| 1981 | 2,333 | +0.6% |\n| 1986 | 2,947 | +26.3% |\n| 1991 | 3,552 | +20.5% |\n| 1996 | 4,220 | +18.8% |\n| 2001 | 5,236 | +24.1% |\n| 2006 | 6,184 | +18.1% |\n| 2011 | 6,699 | +8.3% |\n| 2016 | 7,740 | +15.5% |\n| 2021 | 7,429 | −4.0% |\n| Source: Statistics Canada[5][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] |\n\n\nIn the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Iqaluit had a population of 7,429 living in 2,708 of its 3,297 total private dwellings, a change of -4% from its 2016 population of 7,740. With a land area of 51.58 km2 (19.92 sq mi), it had a population density of 144.0/km2 (373.0/sq mi) in 2021.[5]\n\n\nThe median value of these dwellings is $376,639, quite a bit higher than the national median at $280,552. The average household has about 2.8 people living in it, and the average family has 1.4 children living at home with them. The median (after-tax) household income in Iqaluit is quite high, $98,921, almost double the national rate at $54,089. The median income for an individual in the city, is also high, $60,688. 5.9 per cent of people (over 15 years old) are either divorced or separated, which is quite a bit lower than the national rate at 8.6 per cent. Also, 53.3 per cent of the population is either married or living with a common law partner.\n\n\nIqaluit has quite a young population, the median age of the population is more than 10 years younger than the national rate, 30.1 years old compared to 40.6 years old.\n\n\nFor those over the age of 25:\n\n\n\n* 75.7% are high school educated (15.9% as their highest level of education)\n* 59.8% are post-secondary school educated\n* 24.3% have no certificate, diploma or degree\n\n\nThe 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 750 persons or 10.3% of the total population of Iqaluit. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were Philippines (195 persons or 26.0%), Cameroon (50 persons or 6.7%), United Kingdom (40 persons or 5.3%), Nigeria (40 persons or 5.3%), Zimbabwe (40 persons or 5.3%), United States of America (35 persons or 4.7%), India (25 persons or 3.3%), Pakistan (20 persons or 2.7%), China (20 persons or 2.7%), Jamaica (20 persons or 2.7%), and Ethiopia (20 persons or 2.7%).[40]\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Iqaluit has the most Inuit in both numbers (3,900) and per centages (59.1 per cent), of all Canadian cities with populations greater than 5,000.[41][42]\n\n\n\n\n\nPanethnic groups in the City of Iqaluit (2001–2021)\n| Panethnic group\n | 2021[40] | 2016[43] | 2011[44] | 2006[45] | 2001[46] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % |\n| Indigenous | 4,055\n | 55.47%\n | 4,505\n | 59.35%\n | 4,040\n | 61.21%\n | 3,650\n | 59.98%\n | 3,065\n | 59%\n |\n| European[a] | 2,350\n | 32.15%\n | 2,500\n | 32.94%\n | 2,265\n | 34.32%\n | 2,235\n | 36.73%\n | 2,030\n | 39.08%\n |\n| African | 395\n | 5.4%\n | 225\n | 2.96%\n | 70\n | 1.06%\n | 45\n | 0.74%\n | 25\n | 0.48%\n |\n| Southeast Asian[b] | 235\n | 3.21%\n | 165\n | 2.17%\n | 70\n | 1.06%\n | 35\n | 0.58%\n | 15\n | 0.29%\n |\n| South Asian | 100\n | 1.37%\n | 65\n | 0.86%\n | 55\n | 0.83%\n | 30\n | 0.49%\n | 15\n | 0.29%\n |\n| East Asian[c] | 55\n | 0.75%\n | 60\n | 0.79%\n | 60\n | 0.91%\n | 65\n | 1.07%\n | 25\n | 0.48%\n |\n| Latin American | 40\n | 0.55%\n | 25\n | 0.33%\n | 15\n | 0.23%\n | 10\n | 0.16%\n | 10\n | 0.19%\n |\n| Middle Eastern[d] | 35\n | 0.48%\n | 30\n | 0.4%\n | 10\n | 0.15%\n | 10\n | 0.16%\n | 10\n | 0.19%\n |\n| Other[e] | 40\n | 0.55%\n | 10\n | 0.13%\n | 10\n | 0.15%\n | 10\n | 0.16%\n | 0\n | 0%\n |\n| Total responses\n | 7,310\n | 98.4%\n | 7,590\n | 98.06%\n | 6,600\n | 98.52%\n | 6,085\n | 98.4%\n | 5,195\n | 99.22%\n |\n| Total population\n | 7,429\n | 100%\n | 7,740\n | 100%\n | 6,699\n | 100%\n | 6,184\n | 100%\n | 5,236\n | 100%\n |\n| Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses |\n\n\n![](image)A stop sign in Iqaluit. The sign features the two most-spoken languages in the city, English and Inuktitut.\n![](image)Catholic Church\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nThere is no \"majority mother tongue\" in Iqaluit, as 45.4 percent reported their mother tongue as being English, and 45.4 percent also reported their mother tongue as Inuktitut. English is spoken by 97.2 percent of Iqalummiuts, however, whereas only 53.1 percent can speak Inuktitut. French was the mother tongue of 4.8 percent of the population, which is the same figure of the population who can speak the language. As of 2012, \"Pirurvik, Iqaluit's Inuktitut language training centre, has a new goal: to train instructors from Nunavut communities to teach Inuktitut in different ways and in their own dialects when they return home.\"[47]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, religious groups in Iqaluit included:[40]\n\n\n\n* Christianity (3,975 persons or 54.4%)\n* Irreligion (3,060 persons or 41.9%)\n* Islam (90 persons or 1.2%)\n* Indigenous Spirituality (50 persons or 0.7%)\n* Hinduism (30 persons or 0.4%)\n* Judaism (20 persons or 0.3%)\n* Buddhism (10 persons or 0.1%)\n* Other (75 persons or 1.0%)\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nakasuk School is one of six publicly funded schools in the city.\n![](image)Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum\n![](image)Joamie Ilinniarvik School\nThe Qikiqtani School Operations based in Pond Inlet operates five schools in the area. Nanook Elementary School, located in Apex, Nakasuk School and Joamie Ilinniarvik School offer kindergarten to grade 5. Aqsarniit Ilinniarvik School offers grades 6 to 8 and Inuksuk High School offers grades 9 to 12.[48]\n\n\nThe Commission scolaire francophone du Nunavut runs École des Trois-Soleils and offers kindergarten to grade 12.[49]\n\n\nAt the post-secondary level there are two, Nunavut Arctic College (Nunatta Campus) and Akitsiraq Law School.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Emergency services[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Royal Canadian Mounted Police during a Canada Day parade in 1999. Policing is provided by the RCMP's V Division.\n![](image)Iqaluit Hospital\nEmergency services (fire and ambulance) are provided by city from a single station on Niaqunngusiariaq.[50]\n\n\nThe emergency services fleet consists of:\n\n\n\n* 1 engine\n* 1 ladder\n* 2 staff vehicles\n* 3 ambulances\n\n\nIqaluit Airport Emergency Services is responsible for fire services at the airport. Following a fire at the airport in 1998, the Government of Nunavut re-opened the fire station at the airport.[51] Their fleet consists of:\n\n\n\n* Waltek C-5500 ARFF\n* Oshkosh T3000 ARFF\n\n\nPolicing in Iqaluit, as with the rest of Nunavut, is contracted to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) V Division[52] and the city is home to the divisional headquarters.[53]\n\n\n\n### Medical services[edit]\n\n\nQikiqtani General Hospital is the primary care facility in the city. There is also a Family Practice Clinic providing primary care services by Nurse Practitioners. Two dental clinics exist in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sports facilities[edit]\n\n\nIqaluit features two arenas, the Arctic Winter Games Arena and Arnaitok, the Iqaluit Aquaplex, a curling rink, the Timmianut Pikiuqarvik disc golf course, the Frobisher Inn Fitness Centre, in the W.G. Brown Building/Astro Hill Complex,[54] a golf course, outdoor basketball courts, soccer nets, seasonal outdoor ice rinks, a shooting range, a skatepark, and more.[55]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iqaluit Public Transit, Highways in Nunavut, and Crimson Route\n\nIqaluit is the smallest Canadian capital in terms of population, and the only capital that is not connected to other settlements by a highway. Located on an island remote from the Canadian highway system, Iqaluit is generally only accessible by aircraft and, subject to ice conditions, by boat.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit Airport hosts a number of scheduled flights to Ottawa, Montreal, Rankin Inlet, Kuujjuaq, and smaller communities throughout Nunavut.\nIqaluit Airport is a modern facility with a runway long enough for most modern jet aircraft. A new, larger passenger terminal building north of the old terminal was completed in 2018.\n\n\nCanadian North serves Iqaluit from Ottawa, Yellowknife, and several communities in Nunavut. Locally based airlines Air Nunavut, Canadian Helicopters, Nunasi Helicopters, and Unaalik Aviation provide air charters, and Air Nunavut and Keewatin Air provide MEDIVAC/air ambulance service. Air Canada Jazz provided daily service to Iqaluit from Ottawa in 2010 and 2011, but cancelled service due to rising fuel costs, which prevented the route from being profitable.[56][57]\n\n\nIqaluit shared its runway with the Royal Canadian Air Force until the Canadian Forces stopped using Iqaluit as a Canadian NORAD Region Forward Operating Location. The barracks and CF-188 hangars are maintained. The airport has been a centre for cold-weather testing of new aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 in February 2006.\n\n\nRumours that Iqaluit was an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle are false.[58]\n\n\nIn the middle of summer, a few ships—generally no larger than a *Liberty*-class vessel—transport bulk and heavy goods to the city. Cargo is currently off-loaded onto barges as the harbour is not deep enough; however, the city is currently constructing a deep-seaport which is expected to open in 2023.[59] The deep-seaport, which will cost approximately $85 million, will provide all-tide access to ships and will have space for one ship to dock and unload, with the ability to offload a second using a barge-and-ramp method.[60][61] Initial plans for the port included facilities for a vehicle ferry connection to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, however these plans were dropped due to high cost.[62] Experienced locals also cross the Hudson Strait from the Canadian mainland when it freezes over, either on foot or by dog sled or snowmobile, a distance of over 100 km (62 mi).\n\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit has a local road system that does not extend far beyond the city limits. During the winter, remote areas near the city are only accessible by snowmobiles, dog sled, or foot.\nIqaluit has a local road system only stretching from the nearby community of Apex to the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park, 1 km (0.62 mi) west of town. Iqaluit has no public transportation, although there is citywide taxi service. Iqaluit Public Transit used to offer bus service in the city, but the service was cancelled due to low ridership. Motor cars are increasing in number, to the extent of causing occasional traffic jams known locally as \"the rush minute\". The cost of shipping automobiles and the wear-and-tear of the harsh Arctic climate combined with its notoriously rough roadways mean that snowmobiles remain the preferred form of personal transportation. All-terrain vehicles are also common in most of the Canadian Arctic. Snowmobiles are used to travel within the city and in the surrounding area. In winter, dog sleds are still used, but primarily for recreation. In winter, the nearby Qaummaarviit Territorial Park and the more remote Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve are only accessible by snowmobile, dog sled or foot. In the summer, both are accessible by boat. Most major roads within Iqaluit are paved with asphalt, but local and smaller roads are gravel. Roads do not have traffic signals, but use stop signs to control intersections.\n\n\nResidents and businesses identify their locations mostly by building number, and occasionally by the name of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone might say that they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals,[63] although some have been installed on a temporary basis.[64]\n\n\n\n### Waste and water treatment[edit]\n\n\nThe city's infrastructure is stressed by growth and lack of means to upgrade. Waste from the city is disposed of into an open air dump on Akilliq Drive (West 40) located south of the city.[65]\n\n\nAlthough the city has water treatment facilities, raw sewage from the city is often dumped untreated into nearby Frobisher Bay.[65]\n\n\nAs the dump has reached capacity, the city plans to open a second dump 9 km (5.6 mi) north of the city.[66] Iqaluit does not have a recycling program in place; all recyclable materials are sent into the waste stream.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Offices for the Nunatsiaq News. Nunatsiaq News is one of two weekly newspapers that circulate in Iqaluit.\n![](image)Harbour view\n![](image)Harbour view\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nLandline services in Iqaluit (established in 1958 by Bell Canada) and throughout northern Canada (established by Northwestel in five western Nunavut communities, and by Bell Canada elsewhere in Nunavut), are provided since 1992 by Northwestel.[67]\n\n\nCell service is provided by Ice Wireless,[68] Bell Mobility,[69] and Qiniq.[70]\n\n\nInternet service is available through Northwestel, Ice Wireless, Qiniq, Xplornet and Meshnet.[71] Meshnet Community WiFi is a free community WiFi and paid service available in most areas of the city. Free services include access to Isuma.tv, and many other resources.\n\n\n\n### Press[edit]\n\n\n* *Nunatsiaq News*\n* *News/North*\n\n\n![](image)Broadcast studio for CFFB radio, and the regional network centre for Nunavut for CBC North.\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Frequency\n | Call sign\n | Branding\n | Format\n | Owner\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AM 1230 & FM 91.1\n | CFFB | CBC Radio One | Talk radio, public radio | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | Part of CBC North; broadcasts English and Inuktitut programming\n |\n| FM 88.3\n | CBM-FM-3 | CBC Music | Assorted music, public radio | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | Rebroadcaster of CBM-FM (Montreal)\n |\n| FM 93.3\n | CIQA-FM | Weatheradio Canada | Weather radio | Meteorological Service of Canada | Rebroadcaster of VEV284 (Iqaluit Airport)\n |\n| FM 99.9\n | CKIQ-FM | Ice FM\n | Classic rock | Northern Lights Entertainment\n |  |\n| FM 103.5\n | CKGC-FM | Capital FM\n | Oldies | Northern Lights Entertainment\n |  |\n| FM 107.3\n | CFRT-FM | 107.3 CFRT\n | Community radio | Association des Francophones du Nunavut\n | French language community radio\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| OTA channel\n | Call sign\n | Network\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10 (VHF)\n | CH4161 | Aboriginal Peoples Television Network | Eastern Time Zone feed\n |\n| 12 (VHF)\n | CH2260 | Ici Radio-Canada Télé | Community-owned rebroadcaster of CBFT-DT (Montreal)\n |\n\n\nIqaluit was served by CFFB-TV channel 8, a CBC Television/CBC North repeater of CFYK-DT (Yellowknife) until 31 July 2012 when it was closed because of budget cuts at the CBC.[72][73]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Eva Aariak, politician, former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and second Premier of Nunavut\n* Paul-André Brasseur, child actor\n* Ann Meekitjuk Hanson, former Commissioner of Nunavut\n* Kenn Harper, grocer, amateur historian, and entrepreneur\n* Lucie Idlout, rock singer, songwriter\n* Matty McNair, US-born explorer\n* Mosha Michael, filmmaker[74]\n* Simonie Michael, first Inuk to be elected to what is now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in 1966[75]\n* Nakasuk, founder of Iqaluit\n* Paul Okalik, lawyer, politician, member of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, first Premier of Nunavut and former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.

It was known as **Frobisher Bay** from 1942 to 1987, after the large bay on the coast on which the city is situated. The northernmost city in Canada, its traditional Inuktitut name was restored in 1987.\n\n\nIn 1999, Iqaluit was designated the capital of Nunavut after the division of the Northwest Territories into two separate territories. Before this event, Iqaluit was a small city and not well known outside the Canadian Arctic or Canada, with population and economic growth highly limited. This is due to the city's isolation and heavy dependence on expensive imported supplies, as the city, like the rest of Nunavut, has no road or rail, and only has ship connections for part of the year to the rest of Canada. The city has a polar climate, influenced by the cold deep waters of the Labrador Current just off Baffin Island—this makes the city of Iqaluit cold, although it is well south of the Arctic Circle.\n\n\nAs of the 2021 Canadian census, the population was 7,429[5] (population centre: 6,991[6]), a decrease of 4.0 per cent from the 2016 census. Iqaluit has the lowest population of any capital city in Canada. Inhabitants of Iqaluit are called *Iqalummiut* (singular: *Iqalummiuq*).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIqaluit has been a traditional fishing location used by Inuit and their predecessors, the Paleo-Eskimo (Dorset culture) and Thule, for thousands of years.[9][10] The name, *Iqaluit,* comes from Inuktitut Iqaluit (ᐃᖃᓗᐃᑦ) which means *place of many fish*.[8]\n\n\nWorld War II resulted in an influx of non-Inuit to the area in 1942, when the United States built Frobisher Bay Air Base there, on a long-term lease from the Government of Canada, in order to provide a stop-over and refuelling site for the short-range aircraft being ferried to Europe to support the war effort. Iqaluit's first permanent resident was Nakasuk, an Inuk guide who helped United States Army Air Forces planners to choose a site with a large flat area suitable for a landing strip. The wartime airstrip was known as Crystal Two, was part of the Crimson Route and operates today as Iqaluit Airport.\n\n\nIt had long been used as a campsite and fishing spot by the Inuit, who called it *Iqaluit* – \"place of many fish\" in Inuktitut. The US and Canadian authorities named it *Frobisher Bay*, after the name of the body of water it borders.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations to Apex in 1949 (pictured in 2005) to take advantage of the nearby airfield.\nIn 1949, after the war, the Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations to the neighbouring valley of *Niaqunngut*, officially called Apex, in order to use the airfield. In the mid-1950s, the population of Frobisher Bay increased rapidly during the construction of the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW line), a system of defensive radar stations—see North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\n\n\nHundreds of mostly non-Inuit construction workers, military personnel, and administrative staff moved into the community, and several hundred Inuit followed, to take advantage of the access to jobs and medical care provided by the base operations. By 1957, 489 of the town's 1,200 residents were reported to be Inuit. After 1959, the Canadian government established permanent services at Frobisher Bay, including full-time doctors, a school, and social services. The Inuit population grew rapidly in response, as the government encouraged Inuit to settle permanently in communities supported by government services.\n\n\nNaval Radio Station (NRS) Frobisher Bay (HMCS Frobisher Bay), callsign CFI, was established in July 1954 as a result of the closure of NRS Chimo, Quebec. Station CFI was part of the Supplementary Radio network. Because of its remoteness and size, it was very expensive to operate. Renamed CFS Frobisher Bay in 1966, advancing technology eventually forced the closure of CFI later that year.[11]\n\n\nThe American military left Iqaluit in 1963, as their development of the intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) diminished the strategic value of the DEW line and Arctic airbases. Canada continued to operate an administrative and logistical centre for much of the eastern Arctic at Frobisher Bay. In 1964, the first local elections were held for a community council, and in 1979 for the first mayor. The founding of the Gordon Robertson Educational Centre, now Inuksuk High School, in the early 1970s at Iqaluit confirmed the government's commitment to the community as an administrative centre. At the time of its founding, this was the sole high school operating in what constituted more than one-seventh of Canadian territory.\n\n\nOn 1 January 1987, the name of the municipality was changed from \"Frobisher Bay\" to \"Iqaluit\" – aligning official usage with the name that the Inuit population had always used. (Many documents were made that referred to Iqaluit as Frobisher Bay for several years after 1987). In the non-binding 1995 Nunavut capital plebiscite, held 11 December, the residents of what would become the new territory selected Iqaluit (over Rankin Inlet) to serve as the future capital. On 19 April 2001, it was designated a city.\n\n\nCanada designated Iqaluit as the host city for the 2010 meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers, held on 5–6 February.[12] The requirements for the international meeting strained the northern communications technology infrastructure and required supplemental investment.[13]\n\n\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n* 1576 – Englishman Martin Frobisher sails into Frobisher Bay believing he has found the westward route to China. He held the first Anglican church service in North America here.\n* 1861 – Charles Francis Hall, an American, camps at the Sylvia Grinnell River and explores the waters of Koojesse Inlet,[14] which he names after his Inuit guide.\n* 1942 – The United States Army Air Forces selects this area as the site of a major air base to support war efforts in the United Kingdom and Europe.\n* 1949 – The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) moves its trading post from Ward Inlet to nearby Apex.\n* 1955 – Frobisher Bay becomes the centre for the United States/Canada DEW Line construction operations.

He is the first Pope to visit Nunavut.[17]\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit is situated on the Everett Mountains\nIqaluit is the northernmost city in Canada, at 63 degrees north of the Equator. Iqaluit is located in the Everett Mountains, which rise from Koojesse Inlet,[14] an inlet of Frobisher Bay, on the southeast part of Baffin Island. It is well to the east of Nunavut's mainland, and northeast of Hudson Bay.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit has a tundra climate, featuring long, cold winters, and brief summers that are too cool to permit the growth of large trees.\nIqaluit has a tundra climate (Köppen: *ET*) typical of the Arctic region, although it is well outside the Arctic Circle. The city features long, cold winters and brief, cool summers. Average monthly temperatures are below freezing for eight months of the year.[18] Iqaluit averages just over 400 mm (16 in) of precipitation annually, much wetter than many other localities in the Arctic Archipelago, with the summer being the wettest season. Temperatures of the winter months are comparable to other northern communities further west on the continent such as Yellowknife and to some extent even Fairbanks, Alaska, even though Iqaluit is a few degrees colder than the latter. Summer temperatures are, however, much colder due to its easterly maritime position affected by the waters of the cold Baffin Island Current. This means that the tree line is much further south in the eastern part of Canada, being as southbound, in spite of low elevation, as northern Labrador.[19]\n\n\nAlthough it is north of the natural tree line, there are some short, south-facing imported black spruce (*Picea mariana*) specimens protected by snowdrifts in the winter,[20] in addition to a few shrubs, which are woody plants. These include the Arctic willow (*Salix arctica*). The Arctic willow may be up to around 7.6 m (25 ft) horizontally, but only 150 mm (6 in) tall.\n\n\nThe climate of Iqaluit is also colder than Gulf Stream locations on the same latitude. For example, the Norwegian city of Trondheim has an annual mean temperature that is 15.2 °C (27.4 °F) milder.\n\n\nThe lowest temperature ever recorded was −45.6 °C (−50.1 °F) on 10 February 1967.[18] The highest temperature ever recorded in Iqaluit was 26.8 °C (80.2 °F) on 21 July 2008.[21]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Iqaluit (Iqaluit Airport)WMO ID: 71909; coordinates 63°45′N 68°33′W﻿ / ﻿63.750°N 68.550°W﻿ / 63.750; -68.550﻿ (Iqaluit Airport); elevation: 33.5 m (110 ft); 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1946–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high humidex | 3.3\n | 5.2\n | 4.3\n | 6.8\n | 13.3\n | 21.7\n | 27.8\n | 27.6\n | 18.8\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 3.4\n | 27.8\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 7.2(45.0)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 9.1(48.4)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | −22.0(−7.6)\n | −22.9(−9.2)\n | −17.6(0.3)\n | −8.9(16.0)\n | −0.3(31.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −14.7(5.5)\n | −4.9(23.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | −26.0(−14.8)\n | −27.0(−16.6)\n | −22.4(−8.3)\n | −13.5(7.7)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 8.1(46.6)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | −3.2(26.2)\n | −11.1(12.0)\n | −18.9(−2.0)\n | −8.6(16.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −29.9(−21.8)\n | −31.0(−23.8)\n | −27.2(−17.0)\n | −18.1(−0.6)\n | −6.1(21.0)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | −5.8(21.6)\n | −14.7(5.5)\n | −23.0(−9.4)\n | −12.2(10.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −45.0(−49.0)\n | −45.6(−50.1)\n | −44.7(−48.5)\n | −34.2(−29.6)\n | −26.1(−15.0)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −2.5(27.5)\n | −12.8(9.0)\n | −27.1(−16.8)\n | −36.2(−33.2)\n | −43.4(−46.1)\n | −45.6(−50.1)\n |\n| Record low wind chill | −65.4\n | −65.6\n | −62.1\n | −53.1\n | −36.0\n | −18.8\n | −7.2\n | −8.6\n | −18.6\n | −42.9\n | −56.8\n | −60.1\n | −65.6\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 14.0(0.55)\n | 21.4(0.84)\n | 22.7(0.89)\n | 21.0(0.83)\n | 48.7(1.92)\n | 39.8(1.57)\n | 61.7(2.43)\n | 50.8(2.00)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 18.5(0.73)\n | 16.2(0.64)\n | 361.2(14.22)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 0.4(0.02)\n | 0.1(0.00)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 46.1(1.81)\n | 44.4(1.75)\n | 65.5(2.58)\n | 43.9(1.73)\n | 12.3(0.48)\n | 0.7(0.03)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 216.6(8.53)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 19.4(7.6)\n | 15.1(5.9)\n | 20.6(8.1)\n | 23.8(9.4)\n | 23.0(9.1)\n | 3.8(1.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.0)\n | 8.5(3.3)\n | 21.1(8.3)\n | 25.9(10.2)\n | 28.8(11.3)\n | 190.0(74.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 12.1\n | 10.7\n | 12.4\n | 12.8\n | 10.6\n | 12.3\n | 12.4\n | 14.3\n | 15.7\n | 13.2\n | 12.5\n | 12.8\n | 151.5\n |\n| Average rainy days (≥ 0.2 mm) | 0.06\n | 0.06\n | 0.06\n | 0.06\n | 1.7\n | 10.7\n | 13.1\n | 14.8\n | 13.2\n | 3.8\n | 0.24\n | 0.0\n | 57.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.2 cm) | 10.1\n | 8.8\n | 8.7\n | 9.6\n | 8.7\n | 2.1\n | 0.06\n | 0.12\n | 3.7\n | 9.8\n | 11.9\n | 12.7\n | 86.3\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%) (at 3pm) | 68.1\n | 67.6\n | 68.9\n | 74.6\n | 77.3\n | 74.6\n | 72.9\n | 73.5\n | 75.2\n | 78.7\n | 78.4\n | 74.3\n | 73.7\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 32.4\n | 94.0\n | 172.2\n | 216.5\n | 180.5\n | 200.2\n | 236.8\n | 156.8\n | 87.9\n | 51.4\n | 35.6\n | 12.6\n | 1,476.8\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 18.5\n | 39.0\n | 47.4\n | 48.2\n | 31.9\n | 32.5\n | 39.3\n | 31.0\n | 22.4\n | 16.8\n | 17.7\n | 8.9\n | 29.5\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 0\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 4\n | 4\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n |\n| Source 1: Environment and Climate Change Canada[22] (Bright Sunshine 1981–2010)[18] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas[23] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skyline of Downtown, the central business district of Iqaluit.\n### Neighbourhoods[edit]\n\n\n* Downtown (central)\n* Happy Valley (north)\n* Lake Subdivision (north) – residential area\n* Lower Base (south)\n* Lower Iqaluit (southeast)\n* North 40 (northwest) – located on the north side of the airport\n* Plateau Subdivision (northwest) – residential area\n* Road To Nowhere (north)\n* Tundra Valley (west)\n* Tundra Ridge (west) – home to two of the city's schools and youth centre\n* West 40 (southwest) – commercial area\n\n![](image)View of Apex, a suburban neighbourhood of Iqaluit.\n### Suburbs[edit]\n\n\nApex (Niaqunngut), officially and functionally part of the City of Iqaluit, is a small community about 5 km (3.1 mi) southeast (63°43′20″N 068°26′56″W﻿ / ﻿63.72222°N 68.44889°W﻿ / 63.72222; -68.44889﻿ (Apex)[24]) from Iqaluit's centre and is known in Inuktitut as *Niaqunngut*. It is located on a small peninsula separating Koojesse Inlet from Tarr Inlet. There is a women's shelter, a church, a primary school (Nanook Elementary School), a design shop and a bed and breakfast in the community. Apex was where most Inuit lived when Iqaluit was a military site and off-limits to anyone not working at the base.\n\n\n\n### Architecture and attractions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(January 2016)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)The Legislative Building of Nunavut is a distinctive building in Iqaluit.\nMuch of Iqaluit's architecture is functional—designed to minimize material costs, while retaining heat and withstanding the climate. Early architecture runs from the 1950s military barracks of the original DEW line installation, through the 1970s white hyper-modernist fibreglass block of the Nakasuk School and Municipal Offices and Arena, to the lines of the steel-reinforced concrete high-rise complex on the hill above it. A number of older Hudson's Bay Company and early 1950s buildings have been retained and restored in Apex (the former nursing station has been revived as the Rannva Bed and Breakfast, the HBC buildings as an art gallery). The newer buildings are more colourful and diverse, and closer to the norms of southern architecture.\n\n\nThe principal exception is the Nunavut Legislative Assembly Building, which is remarkable for its colourful interior, adorned with some of the very best in Inuit art. A new legislative building is in planning to be developed and built outside the city on the Apex Road.\n\n\n\n![](image)Shaped like an igloo, St. Jude's Cathedral is the seat of the Anglican Diocese of The Arctic.\nAnother distinctive building was St. Jude's Anglican Cathedral, see of the Anglican Diocese of The Arctic, which was a white building shaped like an igloo. The altar was built by the parishioners, under the guidance of Markoosie Peter, a traditional master carpenter. It was shaped like a traditional Inuit sled, and the cross composed of two crossed narwhal tusks. An incident of arson severely affected the Cathedral structure and interior on 5 November 2005,[25] and it was demolished on 1 June 2006. The cathedral is slowly being rebuilt (foundation 2008 superstructure 2010) and fund-raising continues locally and internationally. In December 2010, the exterior of a similarly shaped replacement cathedral was completed, and interior work was planned for 2011 with a potential opening for Christmas 2011. The current building, informally referred to as the Igloo Cathedral, was opened on 3 June 2012. The unique building, in the shape of an igloo, has traditionally been a landmark and tourist attraction in Iqaluit, besides its important spiritual role for Iqalummiut (people of Iqaluit).\n\n\nOn a ridge overlooking the city is the distinctive blue and white Inuksuk High School. The school is made up of four square sections joined that give a cloverleaf shape when viewed from the air.\n\n\nThe city is also the location of the Nunatta Sunakkutaangit Museum, which houses a large collection of Inuit and Arctic objects. The museum is housed in a restored and extended Hudson's Bay Company building, clad in the HBC signature red and white, transported to Iqaluit from its original site on the Apex Beach.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sylvia Grinnell River in Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park. The territorial park is located just outside the city limits.\nJust west of Iqaluit is the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park. This park is dominated by the valley of the Sylvia Grinnell River. A small visitor's centre with viewing platform is located on top of a hill overlooking scenic waterfalls, tidal flats and traditional fishing sites.\n\n\nNearby on an island near Peterhead Inlet, is the Qaummaarviit Territorial Park. It is a site with a long Inuit history and numerous artifacts have been recovered, including the remains of 11 semi-buried sod houses.\n\n\nA little farther, across Frobisher Bay, are the Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve and the Soper River, a Canadian Heritage River, forming a park corridor linking Iqaluit along traditional overland travel routes with Kimmirut (formerly Lake Harbour). Frobisher Bay extends for almost 110 km (70 mi) to the east, with moderate hills, glaciers and traditional and summer camp sites, opening into the Davis Strait which divides Nunavut from Greenland.\n\n\nIqaluit, like many Nunavut communities, has a volunteer-run annual spring festival. Called Toonik Tyme it involves a combination of traditional Inuit activities combined with more modern events, while the Alianait Music and Arts Festival is held for a week each 21 June.[26] The festival has attracted Canadian and international artists such as Joshua Haulli,[27] Quantum Tangle,[28] Washboard Hank[29] and Namgar.[30]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFederal census population history of Iqaluit| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971 | 2,050 | —     |\n| 1976 | 2,320 | +13.2% |\n| 1981 | 2,333 | +0.6% |\n| 1986 | 2,947 | +26.3% |\n| 1991 | 3,552 | +20.5% |\n| 1996 | 4,220 | +18.8% |\n| 2001 | 5,236 | +24.1% |\n| 2006 | 6,184 | +18.1% |\n| 2011 | 6,699 | +8.3% |\n| 2016 | 7,740 | +15.5% |\n| 2021 | 7,429 | −4.0% |\n| Source: Statistics Canada[5][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39] |\n\n\nIn the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Iqaluit had a population of 7,429 living in 2,708 of its 3,297 total private dwellings, a change of -4% from its 2016 population of 7,740. With a land area of 51.58 km2 (19.92 sq mi), it had a population density of 144.0/km2 (373.0/sq mi) in 2021.[5]\n\n\nThe median value of these dwellings is $376,639, quite a bit higher than the national median at $280,552. The average household has about 2.8 people living in it, and the average family has 1.4 children living at home with them. The median (after-tax) household income in Iqaluit is quite high, $98,921, almost double the national rate at $54,089. The median income for an individual in the city, is also high, $60,688. 5.9 per cent of people (over 15 years old) are either divorced or separated, which is quite a bit lower than the national rate at 8.6 per cent. Also, 53.3 per cent of the population is either married or living with a common law partner.\n\n\nIqaluit has quite a young population, the median age of the population is more than 10 years younger than the national rate, 30.1 years old compared to 40.6 years old.\n\n\nFor those over the age of 25:\n\n\n\n* 75.7% are high school educated (15.9% as their highest level of education)\n* 59.8% are post-secondary school educated\n* 24.3% have no certificate, diploma or degree\n\n\nThe 2021 census reported that immigrants (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 750 persons or 10.3% of the total population of Iqaluit. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were Philippines (195 persons or 26.0%), Cameroon (50 persons or 6.7%), United Kingdom (40 persons or 5.3%), Nigeria (40 persons or 5.3%), Zimbabwe (40 persons or 5.3%), United States of America (35 persons or 4.7%), India (25 persons or 3.3%), Pakistan (20 persons or 2.7%), China (20 persons or 2.7%), Jamaica (20 persons or 2.7%), and Ethiopia (20 persons or 2.7%).[40]\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Iqaluit has the most Inuit in both numbers (3,900) and per centages (59.1 per cent), of all Canadian cities with populations greater than 5,000.[41][42]\n\n\n\n\n\nPanethnic groups in the City of Iqaluit (2001–2021)\n| Panethnic group\n | 2021[40] | 2016[43] | 2011[44] | 2006[45] | 2001[46] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % | Pop. | % |\n| Indigenous | 4,055\n | 55.47%\n | 4,505\n | 59.35%\n | 4,040\n | 61.21%\n | 3,650\n | 59.98%\n | 3,065\n | 59%\n |\n| European[a] | 2,350\n | 32.15%\n | 2,500\n | 32.94%\n | 2,265\n | 34.32%\n | 2,235\n | 36.73%\n | 2,030\n | 39.08%\n |\n| African | 395\n | 5.4%\n | 225\n | 2.96%\n | 70\n | 1.06%\n | 45\n | 0.74%\n | 25\n | 0.48%\n |\n| Southeast Asian[b] | 235\n | 3.21%\n | 165\n | 2.17%\n | 70\n | 1.06%\n | 35\n | 0.58%\n | 15\n | 0.29%\n |\n| South Asian | 100\n | 1.37%\n | 65\n | 0.86%\n | 55\n | 0.83%\n | 30\n | 0.49%\n | 15\n | 0.29%\n |\n| East Asian[c] | 55\n | 0.75%\n | 60\n | 0.79%\n | 60\n | 0.91%\n | 65\n | 1.07%\n | 25\n | 0.48%\n |\n| Latin American | 40\n | 0.55%\n | 25\n | 0.33%\n | 15\n | 0.23%\n | 10\n | 0.16%\n | 10\n | 0.19%\n |\n| Middle Eastern[d] | 35\n | 0.48%\n | 30\n | 0.4%\n | 10\n | 0.15%\n | 10\n | 0.16%\n | 10\n | 0.19%\n |\n| Other[e] | 40\n | 0.55%\n | 10\n | 0.13%\n | 10\n | 0.15%\n | 10\n | 0.16%\n | 0\n | 0%\n |\n| Total responses\n | 7,310\n | 98.4%\n | 7,590\n | 98.06%\n | 6,600\n | 98.52%\n | 6,085\n | 98.4%\n | 5,195\n | 99.22%\n |\n| Total population\n | 7,429\n | 100%\n | 7,740\n | 100%\n | 6,699\n | 100%\n | 6,184\n | 100%\n | 5,236\n | 100%\n |\n| Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses |\n\n\n![](image)A stop sign in Iqaluit.

English is spoken by 97.2 percent of Iqalummiuts, however, whereas only 53.1 percent can speak Inuktitut. French was the mother tongue of 4.8 percent of the population, which is the same figure of the population who can speak the language.

Following a fire at the airport in 1998, the Government of Nunavut re-opened the fire station at the airport.[51] Their fleet consists of:\n\n\n\n* Waltek C-5500 ARFF\n* Oshkosh T3000 ARFF\n\n\nPolicing in Iqaluit, as with the rest of Nunavut, is contracted to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) V Division[52] and the city is home to the divisional headquarters.[53]\n\n\n\n### Medical services[edit]\n\n\nQikiqtani General Hospital is the primary care facility in the city. There is also a Family Practice Clinic providing primary care services by Nurse Practitioners. Two dental clinics exist in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sports facilities[edit]\n\n\nIqaluit features two arenas, the Arctic Winter Games Arena and Arnaitok, the Iqaluit Aquaplex, a curling rink, the Timmianut Pikiuqarvik disc golf course, the Frobisher Inn Fitness Centre, in the W.G. Brown Building/Astro Hill Complex,[54] a golf course, outdoor basketball courts, soccer nets, seasonal outdoor ice rinks, a shooting range, a skatepark, and more.[55]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iqaluit Public Transit, Highways in Nunavut, and Crimson Route\n\nIqaluit is the smallest Canadian capital in terms of population, and the only capital that is not connected to other settlements by a highway. Located on an island remote from the Canadian highway system, Iqaluit is generally only accessible by aircraft and, subject to ice conditions, by boat.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit Airport hosts a number of scheduled flights to Ottawa, Montreal, Rankin Inlet, Kuujjuaq, and smaller communities throughout Nunavut.\nIqaluit Airport is a modern facility with a runway long enough for most modern jet aircraft. A new, larger passenger terminal building north of the old terminal was completed in 2018.\n\n\nCanadian North serves Iqaluit from Ottawa, Yellowknife, and several communities in Nunavut. Locally based airlines Air Nunavut, Canadian Helicopters, Nunasi Helicopters, and Unaalik Aviation provide air charters, and Air Nunavut and Keewatin Air provide MEDIVAC/air ambulance service. Air Canada Jazz provided daily service to Iqaluit from Ottawa in 2010 and 2011, but cancelled service due to rising fuel costs, which prevented the route from being profitable.[56][57]\n\n\nIqaluit shared its runway with the Royal Canadian Air Force until the Canadian Forces stopped using Iqaluit as a Canadian NORAD Region Forward Operating Location. The barracks and CF-188 hangars are maintained. The airport has been a centre for cold-weather testing of new aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 in February 2006.\n\n\nRumours that Iqaluit was an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle are false.[58]\n\n\nIn the middle of summer, a few ships—generally no larger than a *Liberty*-class vessel—transport bulk and heavy goods to the city. Cargo is currently off-loaded onto barges as the harbour is not deep enough; however, the city is currently constructing a deep-seaport which is expected to open in 2023.[59] The deep-seaport, which will cost approximately $85 million, will provide all-tide access to ships and will have space for one ship to dock and unload, with the ability to offload a second using a barge-and-ramp method.[60][61] Initial plans for the port included facilities for a vehicle ferry connection to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, however these plans were dropped due to high cost.[62] Experienced locals also cross the Hudson Strait from the Canadian mainland when it freezes over, either on foot or by dog sled or snowmobile, a distance of over 100 km (62 mi).\n\n\n\n![](image)Iqaluit has a local road system that does not extend far beyond the city limits. During the winter, remote areas near the city are only accessible by snowmobiles, dog sled, or foot.\nIqaluit has a local road system only stretching from the nearby community of Apex to the Sylvia Grinnell Territorial Park, 1 km (0.62 mi) west of town. Iqaluit has no public transportation, although there is citywide taxi service. Iqaluit Public Transit used to offer bus service in the city, but the service was cancelled due to low ridership. Motor cars are increasing in number, to the extent of causing occasional traffic jams known locally as \"the rush minute\". The cost of shipping automobiles and the wear-and-tear of the harsh Arctic climate combined with its notoriously rough roadways mean that snowmobiles remain the preferred form of personal transportation. All-terrain vehicles are also common in most of the Canadian Arctic. Snowmobiles are used to travel within the city and in the surrounding area. In winter, dog sleds are still used, but primarily for recreation. In winter, the nearby Qaummaarviit Territorial Park and the more remote Katannilik Territorial Park Reserve are only accessible by snowmobile, dog sled or foot. In the summer, both are accessible by boat. Most major roads within Iqaluit are paved with asphalt, but local and smaller roads are gravel. Roads do not have traffic signals, but use stop signs to control intersections.\n\n\nResidents and businesses identify their locations mostly by building number, and occasionally by the name of a prominent structure. Residents know where in the city certain series of building numbers are located; numbers tend to be aggregated in blocks, so someone might say that they live in the 2600s. Around 2003, street names were developed, although there were delays in finalizing them and posting the signs. Street numbers have not been assigned, and building numbers continue to be used. Iqaluit is the only Canadian capital city not to have traffic signals,[63] although some have been installed on a temporary basis.[64]\n\n\n\n### Waste and water treatment[edit]\n\n\nThe city's infrastructure is stressed by growth and lack of means to upgrade. Waste from the city is disposed of into an open air dump on Akilliq Drive (West 40) located south of the city.[65]\n\n\nAlthough the city has water treatment facilities, raw sewage from the city is often dumped untreated into nearby Frobisher Bay.[65]\n\n\nAs the dump has reached capacity, the city plans to open a second dump 9 km (5.6 mi) north of the city.[66] Iqaluit does not have a recycling program in place; all recyclable materials are sent into the waste stream.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Offices for the Nunatsiaq News. Nunatsiaq News is one of two weekly newspapers that circulate in Iqaluit.\n![](image)Harbour view\n![](image)Harbour view\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nLandline services in Iqaluit (established in 1958 by Bell Canada) and throughout northern Canada (established by Northwestel in five western Nunavut communities, and by Bell Canada elsewhere in Nunavut), are provided since 1992 by Northwestel.[67]\n\n\nCell service is provided by Ice Wireless,[68] Bell Mobility,[69] and Qiniq.[70]\n\n\nInternet service is available through Northwestel, Ice Wireless, Qiniq, Xplornet and Meshnet.[71] Meshnet Community WiFi is a free community WiFi and paid service available in most areas of the city. Free services include access to Isuma.tv, and many other resources.\n\n\n\n### Press[edit]\n\n\n* *Nunatsiaq News*\n* *News/North*\n\n\n![](image)Broadcast studio for CFFB radio, and the regional network centre for Nunavut for CBC North.\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Frequency\n | Call sign\n | Branding\n | Format\n | Owner\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AM 1230 & FM 91.1\n | CFFB | CBC Radio One | Talk radio, public radio | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | Part of CBC North; broadcasts English and Inuktitut programming\n |\n| FM 88.3\n | CBM-FM-3 | CBC Music | Assorted music, public radio | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | Rebroadcaster of CBM-FM (Montreal)\n |\n| FM 93.3\n | CIQA-FM | Weatheradio Canada | Weather radio | Meteorological Service of Canada | Rebroadcaster of VEV284 (Iqaluit Airport)\n |\n| FM 99.9\n | CKIQ-FM | Ice FM\n | Classic rock | Northern Lights Entertainment\n |  |\n| FM 103.5\n | CKGC-FM | Capital FM\n | Oldies | Northern Lights Entertainment\n |  |\n| FM 107.3\n | CFRT-FM | 107.3 CFRT\n | Community radio | Association des Francophones du Nunavut\n | French language community radio\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| OTA channel\n | Call sign\n | Network\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10 (VHF)\n | CH4161 | Aboriginal Peoples Television Network | Eastern Time Zone feed\n |\n| 12 (VHF)\n | CH2260 | Ici Radio-Canada Télé | Community-owned rebroadcaster of CBFT-DT (Montreal)\n |\n\n\nIqaluit was served by CFFB-TV channel 8, a CBC Television/CBC North repeater of CFYK-DT (Yellowknife) until 31 July 2012 when it was closed because of budget cuts at the CBC.[72][73]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* Eva Aariak, politician, former Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) and second Premier of Nunavut\n* Paul-André Brasseur, child actor\n* Ann Meekitjuk Hanson, former Commissioner of Nunavut\n* Kenn Harper, grocer, amateur historian, and entrepreneur\n* Lucie Idlout, rock singer, songwriter\n* Matty McNair, US-born explorer\n* Mosha Michael, filmmaker[74]\n* Simonie Michael, first Inuk to be elected to what is now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories in 1966[75]\n* Nakasuk, founder of Iqaluit\n* Paul Okalik, lawyer, politician, member of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, first Premier of Nunavut and former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.

About 60% of the economy in North Sumatra is backed by trading, agriculture, and processing industries,[9] including exports from its 4 million acres of palm oil plantations. The National Development Planning Agency listed Medan as one of the four main central cities in Indonesia, alongside Jakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar.[10][11]\n\n\nAs of the 2020 Census, Medan had a population of 2,435,252 within its city limits;[12][13] the official population estimate as of mid-2022 was 2,494,512.[3] When the surrounding urban area is included, the population is over 3.4 million, making it the fourth largest urban area in Indonesia.[14] The Medan metropolitan area—which includes neighbouring Binjai, Deli Serdang Regency, and a part of Karo Regency—is the largest metropolitan area outside of Java, with 4,744,323 residents counted in the 2020 Census.[15]\n\n\nThe city was founded at the confluence of the Deli River and the Babura river by a Karonese man named Guru Patimpus. Then called *Kampung Medan Putri*, it became part of the Deli Sultanate, established in 1632. In the late 19th century, colonial Dutch seeking new plantation areas chose Medan and Deli as plantation hubs to found the Deli Company. Within a few years, the Dutch tobacco trade transformed Medan into an economic hub, earning it the nickname *Het Land Dollar* (\"the land of the money\"). The Deli Railway, established to ship tobacco, rubber, tea, timber, palm oil, and sugar from Medan to the Port of Belawan for worldwide export, brought further rapid development to Medan. The city became first the capital of the State of East Sumatra, and then the provincial capital of North Sumatra.\n\n\n\n\n## Nomenclature[edit]\n\n\nThe term *medan* might be derived from a Batak Karo word *madan* (ᯔᯑᯉ᯳), which literally means 'healed', 'blessed', or 'recovered'.[16] The term is associated with the historical Karo Batak figure and founder of the city, Guru Patimpus, who was well-known as a \"healer\" or traditional doctor. The oldest evidence of this term used to refer to the city dates back to c. 13th-15th century era during the reign of Aru, the Karo monarch.[17]\n\n\nThere is also a popular theory that *medan* is of Malay origin, literally meaning 'field'. The term *medan* (مدان) in Malay might be derived from Malayalam *mythaan-am* (മൈതാനം, 'field'), which is cognate to the Tamil word *maitāṉ-am* (மைதானம், 'ground').[18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMedan is located in what was once the Kingdom of Aru, founded by the Karo people and flourishing between the 13th and 16th centuries.[19] A number of archaeological sites survive near Medan, including Kota Rentang, a port settlement in the Hamparan Perak area;[20] Kota Cina, an ancient trading site in Medan Marelan;[21] and Benteng Putri Hijau, a fort ruin in Deli Tua.[22]\n\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Guru Patimpus Sembiring Pelawi, a Karonese man from the Karo Regency, converted from Pemena to Islam. While traveling to study under Datuk Kota Bangun, Guru Patimpus met and married the Princess of Pulo Brayan [id]. Accompanied by their two sons, Kolok and Kecik, the couple founded Medan village between the Deli and Babura Rivers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1632, the Aceh Sultanate under Gocah Pahlawan expanded to include Medan. Perunggit succeeded his father in 1669, and declared the Deli Sultanate, including Medan, independent of the Aceh Sultanate.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n1886 coat of arms of Medan, showing a tobacco plant as the charge\n![](image)\nCoolies working in the seedbeds on a tobacco plantation in Medan, c. 1900\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Dutch authorities began to release new land for tobacco plantations. Said Abdullah Bilsagih, brother-in-law of the Deli Sultan Mahmud Perkasa Alam, persuaded Dutch tobacco merchant Jacob Nienhuys to move his business from Java to Deli. Dutch merchants Van der Falk and Elliot, and Chinese brothers Tjong Yong Hian and Tjong A Fie, were also pioneers of Deli's tobacco industry. In 1867, Nienhuys, Jannsen, P.W. Clemen, and Cremer founded De Deli Maatschappij; in 1869, they moved its head office from Labuhan Deli to Medan. This made Medan a centre of the tobacco trade, which continued to grow with the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal.\n\n\n\nMedan landmarks in 1925\n![](image)\nSultan Amaluddin leaving the Great Mosque on his coronation day\n![](image)\nCrowd in front of Maimun Palace\n\nSultan Ma'mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alamyah, who ruled from 1873 to 1924, moved the kingdom's capital to Medan. He became known as the builder of early Medan, finishing the construction of the Maimun Palace in 1888 and building the Great Mosque of Medan in 1907. In 1898, a Dutch businessman named Aeint Herman de Boer built Hotel de Boer to accommodate the cruise ships of European tourists which had begun to visit Medan.\n\n\nDuring the 1942 Dutch East Indies campaign, the Japanese entered Medan on bicycles and occupied the city. The transfer of power was chaotic, but through use of the Kempetai, the Japanese were able to hold the city until their surrender in 1945. Medan then came under the authority of the South East Asia Command headed by British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. With the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August, Medan became part of the newly-independent Republic of Indonesia, news announced in Medan on 30 September.\n\n\n\n![](image)British Indian soldiers land in East Sumatra to help the Dutch end the Japanese occupation in Medan.\nIn October, Allied troops landed in Belawan and marched on Medan. The subsequent conflicts between the Allies and the Indonesian Army became known as the Battle of Medan.[23][24] The Allies regained control of Medan in April 1946, and in December 1947 the Dutch established the State of East Sumatra with Medan as its capital. This became part of the United States of Indonesia in 1949, and was dissolved into the Republic of Indonesia in 1950.[25]\n\n\nMedan continued to grow as a centre of commerce during the reign of Amaluddin Al Sani Perkasa Alamsyah [id]. \nDevelopments of the 1970s, especially palm oil and rubber plantations, made Medan the busiest city outside Java, with the transmigration program bringing many Javanese and Batak migrants.\n\n\nIn May of 1998, months of student demonstrations in Medan over the 1997 Asian financial crisis turned into riots when a student was killed in a clash with security forces. The next day, the mobs became bigger, and many shops and vehicles in the business district (mostly owned by Chinese residents) were burned and looted. As a result, a curfew was imposed for more than two weeks until peace returned.[26]\n\n\nOn 5 September 2005, Mandala Airlines Flight 091 stalled a minute after taking off from Medan's old Polonia International Airport for a flight to Jakarta. The aircraft crashed into a heavily populated residential area along Djamin Ginting road in *Padang Bulan*. Of the 117 passengers and crews on board, only 17 survived, and an additional 49 civilians on the ground were killed.[27] As a result, Kualanamu International Airport was built in Deli Serdang to replace the old airport, with construction finished in 2012. After the move to the new airport, height restriction laws in Medan were relaxed.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMedan is in the northeastern part of Sumatra island, in the province of North Sumatra. The city is a semi-enclave within Deli Serdang Regency, bordered by Deli Serdang on three sides and the Strait of Malacca to the north. The natural harbor formed where the Deli and Babura rivers feed into the straits has contributed to Medan's growth as a trading port.[28]\n\n\nMedan's elevation varies between 2.5 and 37.5 m (8 ft 2 in and 123 ft 0 in) above sea level, with the Barisan Mountains to the south, and volcanoes such as Sibayak Mountain and Sinabung Mountain 50 to 70 km (31 to 43 mi) from the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Medan features a tropical rainforest climate (*Af*) with no real dry season.[29] Its driest month (January) on average sees about one-third the precipitation of its wettest month (October), with a total annual precipitation of about 2,200 mm (87 in). Temperatures in the city average approximately 27 °C (81 °F) throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Medan (Polonia), elevation: 27 m or 89 ft, 1961–1990\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 35(95)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 35(95)\n | 35(95)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 92(3.6)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 97(3.8)\n | 157(6.2)\n | 178(7.0)\n | 141(5.6)\n | 167(6.6)\n | 185(7.3)\n | 263(10.4)\n | 387(15.2)\n | 253(10.0)\n | 228(9.0)\n | 2,263(89.2)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 14\n | 19\n | 13\n | 18\n | 22\n | 15\n | 13\n | 17\n | 24\n | 22\n | 20\n | 19\n | 216\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 129.6\n | 141.0\n | 153.1\n | 131.2\n | 134.8\n | 157.9\n | 153.9\n | 143.9\n | 123.1\n | 116.3\n | 104.8\n | 98.1\n | 1,587.7\n |\n| Source 1: World Meteorological Organization[30] and Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System (daily mean and record temperature)[31] |\n| Source 2: WeatherOnline (sun, 2010–2019)[32] |\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The former Medan City Hall\n### Mayor[edit]\n\n\nMedan was governed by Abdillah from 2000 until 2008, when he and his vice mayor were caught by the Corruption Eradication Commission. Syamsul Arifin, the governor of North Sumatra Province, appointed Affifudin Lubis [id] as acting mayor, followed by Rahudman Harahap after Lubis's 2009 resignation. Harahap resigned in order to run for office in the 2010 mayoral election, leaving Arifin himself to become acting mayor. In 2013, Harahap was also arrested for corruption, and his deputy Dzulmi Eldin became acting mayor.[33]\n\n\nDzulmi Eldin was elected mayor in 2016,[34] and served until his arrest for corruption in 2019. He was replaced by his vice mayor, Akhyar Nasution, who served until the end of his term in 2021.\n\n\nThe current mayor of Medan is Bobby Nasution, with vice mayor Aulia Rachman [id].[35]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)District divisions of Medan\nMedan is divided into 21 districts (Indonesian: *kecamatan*), tabulated below with their areas and populations at the 2010 Census,[36] and the 2020 Census,[13] together with the official estimates as of mid-2022.[3] The table also includes the number of neighbourhoods (Indonesian: *kelurahan*) in each district, and their postal codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Kode Wilayah | Name ofDistrict(*kecamatan*) | Area  in km2 | Pop'nCensus2010 | Pop'nCensus2020 | Pop'nEstimatemid 2022 | No.ofvillages | Postalcodes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12.71.07 | Medan Tuntungan | 20.68 | 80,942 | 97,249 | 100,200 | 9 | 20134-20141\n |\n| 12.71.11 | Medan Johor | 14.58 | 123,851 | 151,756 | 156,957 | 6 | 20142-20146\n |\n| 12.71.09 | Medan Amplas | 11.19 | 113,143 | 129,726 | 132,458 | 7 | 20147-20149,20219 & 20229\n |\n| 12.71.04 | Medan Denai | 9.05 | 141,395 | 169,643 | 174,744 | 6 | 20226-20228\n |\n| 12.71.10 | Medan Area | 5.52 | 96,544 | 117,029 | 120,788 | 12 | 20211-20217\n |\n| 12.71.01 | Medan Kota | 5.27 | 72,580 | 84,666 | 86,738 | 12 | 20211-20219\n |\n| 12.71.15 | Medan Maimun | 2.98 | 39,581 | 49,231 | 51,066 | 6 | 20151-20159\n |\n| 12.71.16 | Medan Polonia | 9.01 | 52,794 | 59,915 | 61,056 | 5 | 20152-20157\n |\n| 12.71.17 | Medan Baru | 5.84 | 39,516 | 36,522 | 36,681 | 6 | 20153-20156\n |\n| 12.71.21 | Medan Selayang | 12.81 | 98,317 | 103,176 | 103,559 | 6 | 20131-20133\n |\n| 12.71.02 | Medan Sunggal | 15.44 | 112,744 | 129,063 | 131,559 | 6 | 20121-20128\n |\n| 12.71.03 | Medan Helvetia | 13.16 | 144,257 | 164,910 | 168,287 | 7 | 20123-20126\n |\n| 12.71.19 | Medan Petisah | 6.82 | 61,749 | 71,844 | 73,565 | 7 | 20112-20119\n |\n| 12.71.05 | Medan Barat | 5.33 | 70,771 | 88,602 | 92,021 | 6 | 20111-20117\n |\n| 12.71.20 | Medan Timur | 7.76 | 108,633 | 116,985 | 118,008 | 11 | 20231-20239\n |\n| 12.71.18 | Medan Perjuangan | 4.09 | 93,328 | 103,813 | 105,380 | 9 | 20232-20237\n |\n| 12.71.14 | Medan Tembung | 7.99 | 133,579 | 146,534 | 148,346 | 7 | 20221-20225\n |\n| 12.71.06 | Medan Deli | 20.84 | 166,793 | 189,321 | 192,933 | 6 | 20241-20244\n |\n| 12.71.13 | Medan Labuhan | 36.67 | 111,173 | 133,765 | 137,863 | 6 | 20251-20254,20524 & 20525\n |\n| 12.71.12 | Medan Marelan | 23.82 | 140,414 | 182,515 | 190,940 | 5 | 20250-20256\n |\n| 12.71.08 | Medan Kota Belawan | 26.25 | 95,506 | 108,987 | 111,181 | 6 | 20411-20415\n |\n|  | ***Totals*** | *265.10* | *2,097,610* | *2,435,252* | *2,494,512* | *151* |  |\n\n\nThe city centre consists of Medan Petisah, Medan Baru, Medan Polonia, Medan Maimun, Medan Kota, and Medan Barat (West Medan). Medan Labuhan is one of the largest districts by area (together with Medan Belawan and Medan Marelan) and lies in the northern part of the city. Medan Tuntungan serves as the gateway to Karo Regency, Medan Helvetia to Binjai City and Langkat, and Medan Amplas to Tebing Tinggi and Pematang Siantar.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMedan is Indonesia's largest city outside Java, and its fourth largest altogether (after Jakarta, Surabaya and Bandung). The population more than quadrupled in less than fifty years, growing from 568,000 in 1968[37] to 2.1 million in 2010. As of 2020, Medan had a population of 2,435,252 and the larger metropolitan area had a population of 4,756,863.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrativedivision\n | Area in km2 | Pop'nCensus2010\n | Pop'nCensus2020\n | Pop'nEstimatemid 2022\n | Pop'ndensity2022(/km2)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Medan (City)\n | 279.29\n | 2,097,610\n | 2,435,252\n | 2,494,512\n | 8,932\n | [38] |\n| Binjai (City)\n | 93.77\n | 246,154\n | 291,842\n | 300,009\n | 3,199\n | [38] |\n| Deli Serdang Regency | 2,581.23\n | 1,790,431\n | 1,931,441\n | 1,953,986\n | 757\n | [38] |\n| Karo Regency (part)\n | 234.96\n | 86,244\n | 98,328\n | 100,378\n | 427\n | [38] |\n| **Greater Medan** | **3,189.25** | **4,220,439** | **4,756,863** | **4,848,885** | **1,520** | [38] |\n\n\n### Ethnicities and languages[edit]\n\n\nThe chief ethnic groups in Medan are Batak and Javanese, with smaller Malay, Acehnese, Indian, Nias, and Sundanese populations.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Minang, Batak-Karo, Malay, Chinese, Javanese and Indian representatives celebrate a milestone 1924 flight with flowers for the pilots\n| Ethnicities of Medan[39] |\n| --- |\n| Ethnic group |  | Percentage |\n| Batak |  | 34.39% |\n| Javanese |  | 33.03% |\n| Chinese |  | 10.65% |\n| Minangkabau |  | 8.60% |\n| Malays |  | 6.59% |\n| Acehnese |  | 2.78% |\n| Others |  | 3.96% |\n\n![](image)An Indian, local Malay, and Batak seller in Kesawan Chinatown area, taken around the 1940s\nThe Bataks in Medan are of three subethnicities. The native Karo mostly live in the southern parts of Medan, including Padang Bulan, Medan Johor and Tuntungan. The Toba, whom the Dutch employed on their oil palm plantations, live in Marindal and Amplas, or in nearby city centres such as the Medan Perjuangan district. Finally, the Mandailing, who migrated to Medan after Indonesian independence in search of job opportunities, mainly live in Medan Tembung. The primary languages spoken by Bataks in Medan are Batak and Karo.\n\n\nThe large Javanese community in Medan is primarily composed of the descendants of people transported from Java in the 19th century to be employed as contract workers at various plantations in North Sumatra. For the most part, they speak the local dialect of Javanese.\n\n\nThe Malays are also natives of Medan, having lived as fishermen in the outskirts of the city since the Aru era. Starting in the 18th century, they began to spread throughout the city, with large numbers living in Medan Maimun, Kota Matsum, Labuhan and Belawan and speaking Malay.\n\n\nImmigration from southern China to Deli began in the 16th century, and accelerated in the 19th and early 20th centuries as immigrants sought employment as planters and coolies. Medan is home to the largest Chinese population in Sumatra, mostly concentrated around the city centre. Most Chinese people in Medan speak Medan Hokkien, a local dialect, but many also speak Mandarin, Teochew, or Cantonese.\n\n\nMedan also has a substantial Tamil Indonesian community. Kampung Madras, a busy area in the city centre, is well-known as a Tamil neighbourhood.\n\n\nMinangkabau immigration to Medan surged from the 1960s to the 1980s, becoming 8.6% of the population and founding Padang restaurants throughout the city. Most Minangkabau people in Medan speak Minangkabau.[40]\n\n\nMany Acehnese sought sanctuary in Medan after the insurgency in Aceh in the late 1970s. They now own a number of Mie Aceh restaurants around the Setia Budi and Sunggal areas. Most speak Acehnese, and Gayonese is also common.\n\n\nThe different linguistic communities in Medan communicate in a slang called *Bahasa Medan* or *Dialek Medan* (*Medanese slang*). This dialect of Indonesian includes loanwords from the various local languages, especially Malay.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion of Medan – 2019 Census[41] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Islam |  | 65.78% |\n| Protestant |  | 20.14% |\n| Buddhism |  | 8.65% |\n| Catholic |  | 4.63% |\n| Hinduism |  | 0.79% |\n| Others |  | 0.01% |\n\nMost of Medan's inhabitants are Muslim, accounting for approximately 66 percent of the population. The substantial Christian demographic (about 25 percent of the total population) includes Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, and the Batak Christian Protestant Church. Buddhists make up about 9 percent of the population, and there are smaller Hindu, Confucian, and Sikh communities. Some Bataknese follow traditional religions such as Pemena and Parmalim.\n\n\nGunung Timur Temple, on Jalan Hang Tuah, is Medan's oldest Taoist temple. Maha Vihara Maitreya, on Jalan Cemara Asri, is the largest Buddhist temple in southeast Asia. The city's oldest church, Medan Cathedral, on Jalan Pemuda, was originally built as *Indische Kerk* by the Dutch and Indian community. Sri Mariamman Temple, on Jalan Zainul Arifin in Kampung Madras, is the city's oldest Hindu temple, built around 1881; it is surrounded by over a hundred statues of various deities. Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni, a Catholic church in an Indo-Mogul style, was built on Jalan Sakura III in 2005, dedicated to a Marian apparition in 17th century Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n\n* ![Al-Osmani Mosque (Muslim)](image)\n\nAl-Osmani Mosque (Muslim)\n* ![Immanuel Church (Protestant)](image)\n\nImmanuel Church (Protestant)\n* ![Maha Vihara Maitreya (Buddhist)](image)\n\nMaha Vihara Maitreya (Buddhist)\n* ![Sri Mariamman Temple (Hindu)](image)\n\nSri Mariamman Temple (Hindu)\n* ![Gunung Timur Temple (Taoist)](image)\n\nGunung Timur Temple (Taoist)\n* ![Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni (Catholic)](image)\n\nGraha Maria Annai Velangkanni (Catholic)\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Belawan Container Terminal\nThe Medan metropolitan area was recognized as an Indonesian National Strategic Region (Indonesian: *Kawasan Strategis Nasional*) by Government Regulation No 28/2008. As a major commercial and economic hub of Indonesia, Medan is a centre for the production and trade of commodities including cinnamon, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber, and palm oil. It also has a growing manufacturing sector, producing goods such as cars, machinery, tile, and paper and pulp.\n\n\nMedan's location makes it the main hub of international trade in western Indonesia, with exports going to Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Its trade and tourism businesses have also become essential to the Indonesia–Malaysia–Thailand Growth Triangle.[42] Many multinational companies maintain offices in the city, such as Asian Agri,[43] London Sumatra,[44] Musim Mas,[45] Philips Lighting, Toba Pulp Lestari, Marriott, Wilmar, ABB Group and DBS Bank. Rapid development in Medan has resulted in an upward trend in residential property prices.[46]\n\n\nMedan is one of the major shopping centres of Indonesia, along with Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya. Shopping malls in Medan include:\n\n\n\n* Cambridge City Square\n* Centre Point\n* DeliPark Mall\n* Focal Point\n* Lippo Plaza Mall\n* Manhattan Times Square\n* Medan Mall\n* Plaza Medan Fair\n* Ringroad City Walks\n* Sun Plaza\n* Thamrin Plaza\n\n## Cuisine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Food stall seller in *Jalan Selatpanjang*, Medan\nMedan is known as \"the culinary heaven of Indonesia\" for its variety of ethnic cuisines and prominent street hawkers. Prominent restaurants in Medan include *Nelayan* (halal-Chinese seafood and dim sum), *Garuda* and *Uda Sayang* (nasi padang and gulai), *Sate Afrizal Amir* (sate padang), *Cahaya Baru* (chapati and tandoori), *OnDo Batak grill* and *Tesalonika* (babi panggang (grilled pork) and saksang), *Jalan Selat Panjang* and *Jalan Semarang* (Chinese food), *Jalan Pagaruyung* (Indian and Malay food), and *Jalan Padan Bulan* (Batak food). Other major culinary destinations in Medan include Merdeka Walk, an outdoor area with a number of restaurants, and Pasar Rame, a daily outdoor market.[47]\n\n\nThe local cuisine in Medan comes from a variety of culinary traditions. Soto Medan is a savoury stew of mixed meats and coconut milk, usually served with rice and perkedel. Bika ambon, a popular local cake, is traditionally flavoured with pandanus, but can also be found in banana, durian, cheese, and chocolate flavours. Babi Panggang Karo, grilled pork dipped in blood curd, may be served with sambal andaliman made from local peppers. *Tau Kua He Ci* (豆干虾炸) is a local Chinese variant of rojak, made with fried prawn, vegetables, tofu, and chili sauce. Medanese swiss rolls (*Bolu Meranti*) and dried anchovies are popular souvenirs.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Medan and List of colonial buildings in Medan\n\n![](image)The Tjong A Fie Mansion\nMany examples of colonial Dutch architecture survive in Medan.

Dingemans.[48]\n\n\n\n### Theme parks[edit]\n\n\nAmong Medan's tourist attractions are several theme parks and water parks.\n\n\n\nHillPark GreenHill City[49]\nA relatively new theme park an hour from Medan.\nPantai Cermin Themepark\nA water theme park located in Cermin Beach, Serdang Bedagai.\nWonder Water World\nA water park in Medan itself, located in Central Business District Polonia.\nHairos Water Park\nA water park located near Medan in Deli Serdang.\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North Sumatra Museum\nThe North Sumatra Museum, located south of the city's centre, was formally opened in April 1982 by Daoed Joesoef [id], Minister of Education and Culture. The museum's collection centres around artefacts of North Sumatran ethnic groups.\n\n\nThe Bukit Barisan Museum is a military museum opened by Brigade General Leo Lopulisa [id] on 21 June 1971. Located at 8 Jalan H. Zainul Arifin, the museum houses a number of historic weapons used in the 1958 revolt in North Sumatra, and displays paintings of the rebellion against the Netherlands.[50]\n\n\nThe Rahmat International Wildlife Museum & Gallery, which opened in 1999, is considered the city's outstanding taxidermy collection. It is located on Jalan Letjen S. Parman No.309.[51]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kualanamu International Airport\n\n![](image)Kualanamu International Airport\nThe Kualanamu International Airport (KNO) opened on 25 July 2013 as a replacement for the Polonia Airport. Located 39 km (24 mi) from downtown Medan, it is Indonesia's first airport with a direct rail link to the city. The airport has a 224,298 m2 (2,414,324 sq ft) passenger terminal, and serves as a hub for Garuda Indonesia, Indonesia AirAsia, Lion Air, Susi Air and Wings Air,[52] with direct domestic flights to many major cities in Sumatra, as well as Java-international flights to locations abroad including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n### Seaport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Belawan\n\n![](image)The *Bandar Deli* terminal in Belawan\nThe Port of Belawan is on the northeast coast of Sumatra, 19 km (12 mi) north of Medan and accessible by a railway across the channel south of the island.[53] Originally built in 1890 for European tobacco exports, the harbour was expanded in 1907 with a new section for Chinese and indigenous traders.\n\n\nThe growth of northern Sumatra's rubber and palm oil plantations in the early twentieth century brought new developments to the port. Several major berthing facilities were built in the 1920s, and by 1938 the port handled the greatest cargo value of any in the Dutch East Indies. Trade volumes dropped substantially after Indonesian independence, but reached pre-independence levels again in the mid-1960s. A major restructuring in 1985 saw the construction of a container terminal; it almost immediately captured about one-fifth of Indonesia's containerized exports. Major products exported include rubber, palm oil, tea, and coffee.[54]\n\n\nThe current port has two terminals. The first, which handles passengers, offers ferry services to cities including Penang, Langkawi, Batam, Jakarta, and Surabaya. The second, Belawan International Container Terminal (BICT), is used for export and import services, and is one of the largest shipping industry ports in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nMajor roads through Medan include the Trans-Sumatran Highway and the Belmera Toll Road. Other toll roads link the city to the airport, Binjai, and Tebing Tinggi.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Medan Station\n\n![](image)*Sri Lelawangsa* commuter rail departing from Medan station\n![](image)*Railink* Airport train in Medan station\nThe largest train station in Medan is Medan Station. The city also has a number of smaller stations, including Medan Pasar, Pulu Brayan, Titi Papan, Labuhan, and Belawan. Of these, Titi Papan and Pulu Brayan serve exclusively freight trains, while the others also serve passenger trains.\n\n\nExpress trains run between Medan and cities including Tebing Tinggi, Pematang Siantar, Tanjungbalai, and Rantau Prapat, and the Kualanamu Airport Railink Services express train runs between Medan Station and Kualanamu International Airport Station. Other rail lines connect Medan to cities such as Binjai and Belawan.\n\n\nAn elevated railway over several rail lines around Medan avoids level crossings and reduces traffic congestion.[55]\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Trans Metro Deli* Bus\nBoth auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are widely available in Medan, for a cheap pre-negotiated fare. Ride-sharing services Gojek and Grab are also in widespread use.\n\n\nWhile taxis exist, most locals use sudako, Medan's share taxi system. These minibuses follow routes indicated by numbers displayed on the vehicle; route maps are not published, instead typically being spread by word-of-mouth.\n\n\nMedan and its nearby urban areas have two bus rapid transit systems, **Trans Mebidang** and **Trans Metro Deli**, each with several active corridors.\n\n\n\n#### Trans Mebidang[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Corridor | Origin–Destination\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Medan – Binjai\n |\n| 2 | Medan – Lubuk Pakam\n |\n\n#### Trans Metro Deli[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Corridor | Origin–Destination\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Pinang Baris – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 2 | Amplas – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 3 | Belawan – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 4 | Medan Tuntungan – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 5 | Tembung – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nMedan's television stations include public and private national networks, as well as local channels.

Several local languages are also served on the radio, such as Kardopa Radio (in the Batak language), CityRadio FM and A-Radio FM (in the Chinese language) and Symphony FM (in the Malay language). Other popular stations in Medan include Prambors FM, MNC Trijaya FM, I-Radio, KISS FM, VISI FM, and Delta FM.\n\n\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n*Mimbar Umum* is Medan's oldest newspaper. Other major newspapers based in Medan include *Waspada*, *Analisa*, *Jurnal Medan*, *Berita Sore*, *Harian Global*, *Harian Medan Bisnis*, *Sumut Pos*, *Posmetro Medan*, *Sinar Indonesia Baru*, and *Tribun Medan*, as well as national Mandarin language newspapers such as *Harian Indonesia* (印尼星洲日报), *Guo Ji Ri Bao* (国际日报) and *Shangbao* (印尼商报) and English newspapers like *The Jakarta Post*.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nFrom the 1930s through the 1960s, Medan was the source of a major body of Indonesian literature, known as \"Roman Medan\". These books usually depicted local life in Medan and surrounding areas of Deli.\n\n\nSeveral romance novel writers grew up in Medan, including Hamka, Joesoef Sou'yb [id], Tamar Djaja [id], Matu Mona [id], and A. Damhoeri [id].[56]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\nFootball is one of the most popular sports in Medan, with five local clubs: Persatuan Sepakbola Medan dan Sekitarnya (known as PSMS Medan), Medan Jaya, Medan Chiefs, Bintang PSMS and Medan United. Teladan Stadium, Medan's multi-purpose stadium, is used primarily for football matches.\n\n\nMedan also has a Wushu training centre, Jalan Plaju, and a basketball club, Angsapura Sania.\n\n\n\n## Healthcare[edit]\n\n\n![](image)St. Elisabeth Hospital\n![](image)Murni Teguh Hospital\nMedan has more than 30 registered hospitals, three public and the rest private.\n\n\n\n* Pirngadi General Hospital\n* Adam Malik General Hospital\n* Haji General Hospital\n* St. Elisabeth Hospital\n* Martha Friska Hospital\n* Columbia Asia Hospital\n* Permata Bunda Hospital\n* Murni Teguh Hospital\n* Advent Hospital\n* Siloam-Dhirga Surya Hospital\n* Imelda Hospital\n* Vina Estetica Hospital\n* Stella Maris Hospital\n* Putri Hijau Military Hospital\n* Mitra Sejati General Hospital\n* Bunda Thamrin Hospital\n* Royal Prima Hospital\n* Methodist Hospital\n* Sumatra Eye Center\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Elementary, middle, and high schools[edit]\n\n\nMedan has more than 827 registered elementary schools, 337 middle schools and 288 high schools, including state-owned, private, religious, and international schools.\n\n\n\n* Chandra Kumala School\n* Cinta Budaya School (Chong Wen) (中文学校)\n* Medan Independent School\n* Methodist High School (2–3) Medan\n* Nanyang Zhi Hui School (南洋之晖学校)\n* Perguruan Santo Thomas Medan\n* Prime One School\n* Singapore Intercultural Schools Medan\n* SMA Negeri 1 Medan (state-owned high school)\n* SMA Negeri 2 Medan (state-owned high school)\n* SMA Negeri 3 Medan (state-owned high school)\n* SMA Negeri 4 Medan (state-owned high school)\n* SMP Negeri 18 Medan (state-owned middle school)\n* Sutomo School (1–2) (蘇東中學)[57]\n* Telkom Vocational School (Medan)\n* Yayasan Pendidikan Shafiatul Amaliyah\n* Yayasan Pendidikan Harapan\n\n### Universities and Colleges[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The State University of Medan, a postgraduate campus\nMedan's 72 registered universities,[58] academies, polytechnics, and colleges include:\n\n\n\n* Dharmawangsa University\n* HKBP Nommensen University\n* IT&B Campus\n* Medan State Polytechnic\n* Medan Tourism Academy\n* Mikroskil University\n* Muhammadiyah University of North Sumatra\n* Pelita Harapan University\n* Prima University\n* State University of Medan[59]\n* STBA-PIA (亚洲-国际友好学院)\n* STIE Eka Prasetya\n* Universitas Darma Agung (UDA)\n* Universitas Methodist Indonesia\n* University of North Sumatra[60]\n* University of Pembangunan Panca Budi\n* Technology Institute of Medan\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### Consulates[edit]\n\n\nMedan hosts several consulates and general consulates from foreign countries,[61] such as:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Australia[62]\n* ![](image) Belgium[63]\n* ![](image) China[64]\n* ![](image) Denmark[65]\n* ![](image) Germany[66]\n* ![](image) India[67]\n* ![](image) Japan[68]\n* ![](image) Malaysia[69]\n* ![](image) Netherlands[70]\n* ![](image) Norway[71]\n* ![](image) Poland[72]\n* ![](image) Singapore[73]\n* ![](image) Thailand[74]\n* ![](image) Turkey[75]\n* ![](image) United States[76]\n\n### Twin towns – sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Indonesia\n\nMedan is twinned with:[77]\n\n\n\n* ![Malaysia](image) George Town, Penang Island, Malaysia (10 October 1984)[78]\n* ![Japan](image) Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture, Japan (4 November 1989)[79]\n* ![South Korea](image) Gwangju, South Jeolla Province, South Korea (24 September 1997)[80]\n* ![China](image) Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China (17 December 2002)[81]\n* ![United States](image) Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States (30 October 2014)[82]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Medan Het Parijs van Sumatra, Medan Paris di Sumatra\". *Teknomuda* (in Indonesian). 2 September 2017.

About 60% of the economy in North Sumatra is backed by trading, agriculture, and processing industries,[9] including exports from its 4 million acres of palm oil plantations. The National Development Planning Agency listed Medan as one of the four main central cities in Indonesia, alongside Jakarta, Surabaya, and Makassar.[10][11]\n\n\nAs of the 2020 Census, Medan had a population of 2,435,252 within its city limits;[12][13] the official population estimate as of mid-2022 was 2,494,512.[3] When the surrounding urban area is included, the population is over 3.4 million, making it the fourth largest urban area in Indonesia.[14] The Medan metropolitan area—which includes neighbouring Binjai, Deli Serdang Regency, and a part of Karo Regency—is the largest metropolitan area outside of Java, with 4,744,323 residents counted in the 2020 Census.[15]\n\n\nThe city was founded at the confluence of the Deli River and the Babura river by a Karonese man named Guru Patimpus. Then called *Kampung Medan Putri*, it became part of the Deli Sultanate, established in 1632. In the late 19th century, colonial Dutch seeking new plantation areas chose Medan and Deli as plantation hubs to found the Deli Company. Within a few years, the Dutch tobacco trade transformed Medan into an economic hub, earning it the nickname *Het Land Dollar* (\"the land of the money\"). The Deli Railway, established to ship tobacco, rubber, tea, timber, palm oil, and sugar from Medan to the Port of Belawan for worldwide export, brought further rapid development to Medan. The city became first the capital of the State of East Sumatra, and then the provincial capital of North Sumatra.\n\n\n\n\n## Nomenclature[edit]\n\n\nThe term *medan* might be derived from a Batak Karo word *madan* (ᯔᯑᯉ᯳), which literally means 'healed', 'blessed', or 'recovered'.[16] The term is associated with the historical Karo Batak figure and founder of the city, Guru Patimpus, who was well-known as a \"healer\" or traditional doctor. The oldest evidence of this term used to refer to the city dates back to c. 13th-15th century era during the reign of Aru, the Karo monarch.[17]\n\n\nThere is also a popular theory that *medan* is of Malay origin, literally meaning 'field'. The term *medan* (مدان) in Malay might be derived from Malayalam *mythaan-am* (മൈതാനം, 'field'), which is cognate to the Tamil word *maitāṉ-am* (மைதானம், 'ground').[18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMedan is located in what was once the Kingdom of Aru, founded by the Karo people and flourishing between the 13th and 16th centuries.[19] A number of archaeological sites survive near Medan, including Kota Rentang, a port settlement in the Hamparan Perak area;[20] Kota Cina, an ancient trading site in Medan Marelan;[21] and Benteng Putri Hijau, a fort ruin in Deli Tua.[22]\n\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Guru Patimpus Sembiring Pelawi, a Karonese man from the Karo Regency, converted from Pemena to Islam. While traveling to study under Datuk Kota Bangun, Guru Patimpus met and married the Princess of Pulo Brayan [id]. Accompanied by their two sons, Kolok and Kecik, the couple founded Medan village between the Deli and Babura Rivers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1632, the Aceh Sultanate under Gocah Pahlawan expanded to include Medan. Perunggit succeeded his father in 1669, and declared the Deli Sultanate, including Medan, independent of the Aceh Sultanate.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n1886 coat of arms of Medan, showing a tobacco plant as the charge\n![](image)\nCoolies working in the seedbeds on a tobacco plantation in Medan, c. 1900\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Dutch authorities began to release new land for tobacco plantations. Said Abdullah Bilsagih, brother-in-law of the Deli Sultan Mahmud Perkasa Alam, persuaded Dutch tobacco merchant Jacob Nienhuys to move his business from Java to Deli. Dutch merchants Van der Falk and Elliot, and Chinese brothers Tjong Yong Hian and Tjong A Fie, were also pioneers of Deli's tobacco industry. In 1867, Nienhuys, Jannsen, P.W. Clemen, and Cremer founded De Deli Maatschappij; in 1869, they moved its head office from Labuhan Deli to Medan. This made Medan a centre of the tobacco trade, which continued to grow with the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal.\n\n\n\nMedan landmarks in 1925\n![](image)\nSultan Amaluddin leaving the Great Mosque on his coronation day\n![](image)\nCrowd in front of Maimun Palace\n\nSultan Ma'mun Al Rashid Perkasa Alamyah, who ruled from 1873 to 1924, moved the kingdom's capital to Medan. He became known as the builder of early Medan, finishing the construction of the Maimun Palace in 1888 and building the Great Mosque of Medan in 1907. In 1898, a Dutch businessman named Aeint Herman de Boer built Hotel de Boer to accommodate the cruise ships of European tourists which had begun to visit Medan.\n\n\nDuring the 1942 Dutch East Indies campaign, the Japanese entered Medan on bicycles and occupied the city. The transfer of power was chaotic, but through use of the Kempetai, the Japanese were able to hold the city until their surrender in 1945. Medan then came under the authority of the South East Asia Command headed by British Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. With the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August, Medan became part of the newly-independent Republic of Indonesia, news announced in Medan on 30 September.\n\n\n\n![](image)British Indian soldiers land in East Sumatra to help the Dutch end the Japanese occupation in Medan.\nIn October, Allied troops landed in Belawan and marched on Medan. The subsequent conflicts between the Allies and the Indonesian Army became known as the Battle of Medan.[23][24] The Allies regained control of Medan in April 1946, and in December 1947 the Dutch established the State of East Sumatra with Medan as its capital. This became part of the United States of Indonesia in 1949, and was dissolved into the Republic of Indonesia in 1950.[25]\n\n\nMedan continued to grow as a centre of commerce during the reign of Amaluddin Al Sani Perkasa Alamsyah [id]. \nDevelopments of the 1970s, especially palm oil and rubber plantations, made Medan the busiest city outside Java, with the transmigration program bringing many Javanese and Batak migrants.\n\n\nIn May of 1998, months of student demonstrations in Medan over the 1997 Asian financial crisis turned into riots when a student was killed in a clash with security forces. The next day, the mobs became bigger, and many shops and vehicles in the business district (mostly owned by Chinese residents) were burned and looted. As a result, a curfew was imposed for more than two weeks until peace returned.[26]\n\n\nOn 5 September 2005, Mandala Airlines Flight 091 stalled a minute after taking off from Medan's old Polonia International Airport for a flight to Jakarta. The aircraft crashed into a heavily populated residential area along Djamin Ginting road in *Padang Bulan*. Of the 117 passengers and crews on board, only 17 survived, and an additional 49 civilians on the ground were killed.[27] As a result, Kualanamu International Airport was built in Deli Serdang to replace the old airport, with construction finished in 2012. After the move to the new airport, height restriction laws in Medan were relaxed.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMedan is in the northeastern part of Sumatra island, in the province of North Sumatra. The city is a semi-enclave within Deli Serdang Regency, bordered by Deli Serdang on three sides and the Strait of Malacca to the north. The natural harbor formed where the Deli and Babura rivers feed into the straits has contributed to Medan's growth as a trading port.[28]\n\n\nMedan's elevation varies between 2.5 and 37.5 m (8 ft 2 in and 123 ft 0 in) above sea level, with the Barisan Mountains to the south, and volcanoes such as Sibayak Mountain and Sinabung Mountain 50 to 70 km (31 to 43 mi) from the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Medan features a tropical rainforest climate (*Af*) with no real dry season.[29] Its driest month (January) on average sees about one-third the precipitation of its wettest month (October), with a total annual precipitation of about 2,200 mm (87 in). Temperatures in the city average approximately 27 °C (81 °F) throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Medan (Polonia), elevation: 27 m or 89 ft, 1961–1990\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 35(95)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 35(95)\n | 35(95)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 37.2(99.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 92(3.6)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 97(3.8)\n | 157(6.2)\n | 178(7.0)\n | 141(5.6)\n | 167(6.6)\n | 185(7.3)\n | 263(10.4)\n | 387(15.2)\n | 253(10.0)\n | 228(9.0)\n | 2,263(89.2)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 14\n | 19\n | 13\n | 18\n | 22\n | 15\n | 13\n | 17\n | 24\n | 22\n | 20\n | 19\n | 216\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 129.6\n | 141.0\n | 153.1\n | 131.2\n | 134.8\n | 157.9\n | 153.9\n | 143.9\n | 123.1\n | 116.3\n | 104.8\n | 98.1\n | 1,587.7\n |\n| Source 1: World Meteorological Organization[30] and Worldwide Bioclimatic Classification System (daily mean and record temperature)[31] |\n| Source 2: WeatherOnline (sun, 2010–2019)[32] |\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The former Medan City Hall\n### Mayor[edit]\n\n\nMedan was governed by Abdillah from 2000 until 2008, when he and his vice mayor were caught by the Corruption Eradication Commission. Syamsul Arifin, the governor of North Sumatra Province, appointed Affifudin Lubis [id] as acting mayor, followed by Rahudman Harahap after Lubis's 2009 resignation. Harahap resigned in order to run for office in the 2010 mayoral election, leaving Arifin himself to become acting mayor. In 2013, Harahap was also arrested for corruption, and his deputy Dzulmi Eldin became acting mayor.[33]\n\n\nDzulmi Eldin was elected mayor in 2016,[34] and served until his arrest for corruption in 2019. He was replaced by his vice mayor, Akhyar Nasution, who served until the end of his term in 2021.\n\n\nThe current mayor of Medan is Bobby Nasution, with vice mayor Aulia Rachman [id].[35]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)District divisions of Medan\nMedan is divided into 21 districts (Indonesian: *kecamatan*), tabulated below with their areas and populations at the 2010 Census,[36] and the 2020 Census,[13] together with the official estimates as of mid-2022.[3] The table also includes the number of neighbourhoods (Indonesian: *kelurahan*) in each district, and their postal codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Kode Wilayah | Name ofDistrict(*kecamatan*) | Area  in km2 | Pop'nCensus2010 | Pop'nCensus2020 | Pop'nEstimatemid 2022 | No.ofvillages | Postalcodes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 12.71.07 | Medan Tuntungan | 20.68 | 80,942 | 97,249 | 100,200 | 9 | 20134-20141\n |\n| 12.71.11 | Medan Johor | 14.58 | 123,851 | 151,756 | 156,957 | 6 | 20142-20146\n |\n| 12.71.09 | Medan Amplas | 11.19 | 113,143 | 129,726 | 132,458 | 7 | 20147-20149,20219 & 20229\n |\n| 12.71.04 | Medan Denai | 9.05 | 141,395 | 169,643 | 174,744 | 6 | 20226-20228\n |\n| 12.71.10 | Medan Area | 5.52 | 96,544 | 117,029 | 120,788 | 12 | 20211-20217\n |\n| 12.71.01 | Medan Kota | 5.27 | 72,580 | 84,666 | 86,738 | 12 | 20211-20219\n |\n| 12.71.15 | Medan Maimun | 2.98 | 39,581 | 49,231 | 51,066 | 6 | 20151-20159\n |\n| 12.71.16 | Medan Polonia | 9.01 | 52,794 | 59,915 | 61,056 | 5 | 20152-20157\n |\n| 12.71.17 | Medan Baru | 5.84 | 39,516 | 36,522 | 36,681 | 6 | 20153-20156\n |\n| 12.71.21 | Medan Selayang | 12.81 | 98,317 | 103,176 | 103,559 | 6 | 20131-20133\n |\n| 12.71.02 | Medan Sunggal | 15.44 | 112,744 | 129,063 | 131,559 | 6 | 20121-20128\n |\n| 12.71.03 | Medan Helvetia | 13.16 | 144,257 | 164,910 | 168,287 | 7 | 20123-20126\n |\n| 12.71.19 | Medan Petisah | 6.82 | 61,749 | 71,844 | 73,565 | 7 | 20112-20119\n |\n| 12.71.05 | Medan Barat | 5.33 | 70,771 | 88,602 | 92,021 | 6 | 20111-20117\n |\n| 12.71.20 | Medan Timur | 7.76 | 108,633 | 116,985 | 118,008 | 11 | 20231-20239\n |\n| 12.71.18 | Medan Perjuangan | 4.09 | 93,328 | 103,813 | 105,380 | 9 | 20232-20237\n |\n| 12.71.14 | Medan Tembung | 7.99 | 133,579 | 146,534 | 148,346 | 7 | 20221-20225\n |\n| 12.71.06 | Medan Deli | 20.84 | 166,793 | 189,321 | 192,933 | 6 | 20241-20244\n |\n| 12.71.13 | Medan Labuhan | 36.67 | 111,173 | 133,765 | 137,863 | 6 | 20251-20254,20524 & 20525\n |\n| 12.71.12 | Medan Marelan | 23.82 | 140,414 | 182,515 | 190,940 | 5 | 20250-20256\n |\n| 12.71.08 | Medan Kota Belawan | 26.25 | 95,506 | 108,987 | 111,181 | 6 | 20411-20415\n |\n|  | ***Totals*** | *265.10* | *2,097,610* | *2,435,252* | *2,494,512* | *151* |  |\n\n\nThe city centre consists of Medan Petisah, Medan Baru, Medan Polonia, Medan Maimun, Medan Kota, and Medan Barat (West Medan). Medan Labuhan is one of the largest districts by area (together with Medan Belawan and Medan Marelan) and lies in the northern part of the city. Medan Tuntungan serves as the gateway to Karo Regency, Medan Helvetia to Binjai City and Langkat, and Medan Amplas to Tebing Tinggi and Pematang Siantar.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMedan is Indonesia's largest city outside Java, and its fourth largest altogether (after Jakarta, Surabaya and Bandung). The population more than quadrupled in less than fifty years, growing from 568,000 in 1968[37] to 2.1 million in 2010. As of 2020, Medan had a population of 2,435,252 and the larger metropolitan area had a population of 4,756,863.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrativedivision\n | Area in km2 | Pop'nCensus2010\n | Pop'nCensus2020\n | Pop'nEstimatemid 2022\n | Pop'ndensity2022(/km2)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Medan (City)\n | 279.29\n | 2,097,610\n | 2,435,252\n | 2,494,512\n | 8,932\n | [38] |\n| Binjai (City)\n | 93.77\n | 246,154\n | 291,842\n | 300,009\n | 3,199\n | [38] |\n| Deli Serdang Regency | 2,581.23\n | 1,790,431\n | 1,931,441\n | 1,953,986\n | 757\n | [38] |\n| Karo Regency (part)\n | 234.96\n | 86,244\n | 98,328\n | 100,378\n | 427\n | [38] |\n| **Greater Medan** | **3,189.25** | **4,220,439** | **4,756,863** | **4,848,885** | **1,520** | [38] |\n\n\n### Ethnicities and languages[edit]\n\n\nThe chief ethnic groups in Medan are Batak and Javanese, with smaller Malay, Acehnese, Indian, Nias, and Sundanese populations.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Minang, Batak-Karo, Malay, Chinese, Javanese and Indian representatives celebrate a milestone 1924 flight with flowers for the pilots\n| Ethnicities of Medan[39] |\n| --- |\n| Ethnic group |  | Percentage |\n| Batak |  | 34.39% |\n| Javanese |  | 33.03% |\n| Chinese |  | 10.65% |\n| Minangkabau |  | 8.60% |\n| Malays |  | 6.59% |\n| Acehnese |  | 2.78% |\n| Others |  | 3.96% |\n\n![](image)An Indian, local Malay, and Batak seller in Kesawan Chinatown area, taken around the 1940s\nThe Bataks in Medan are of three subethnicities. The native Karo mostly live in the southern parts of Medan, including Padang Bulan, Medan Johor and Tuntungan. The Toba, whom the Dutch employed on their oil palm plantations, live in Marindal and Amplas, or in nearby city centres such as the Medan Perjuangan district. Finally, the Mandailing, who migrated to Medan after Indonesian independence in search of job opportunities, mainly live in Medan Tembung. The primary languages spoken by Bataks in Medan are Batak and Karo.\n\n\nThe large Javanese community in Medan is primarily composed of the descendants of people transported from Java in the 19th century to be employed as contract workers at various plantations in North Sumatra. For the most part, they speak the local dialect of Javanese.\n\n\nThe Malays are also natives of Medan, having lived as fishermen in the outskirts of the city since the Aru era. Starting in the 18th century, they began to spread throughout the city, with large numbers living in Medan Maimun, Kota Matsum, Labuhan and Belawan and speaking Malay.\n\n\nImmigration from southern China to Deli began in the 16th century, and accelerated in the 19th and early 20th centuries as immigrants sought employment as planters and coolies. Medan is home to the largest Chinese population in Sumatra, mostly concentrated around the city centre. Most Chinese people in Medan speak Medan Hokkien, a local dialect, but many also speak Mandarin, Teochew, or Cantonese.\n\n\nMedan also has a substantial Tamil Indonesian community. Kampung Madras, a busy area in the city centre, is well-known as a Tamil neighbourhood.\n\n\nMinangkabau immigration to Medan surged from the 1960s to the 1980s, becoming 8.6% of the population and founding Padang restaurants throughout the city. Most Minangkabau people in Medan speak Minangkabau.[40]\n\n\nMany Acehnese sought sanctuary in Medan after the insurgency in Aceh in the late 1970s. They now own a number of Mie Aceh restaurants around the Setia Budi and Sunggal areas. Most speak Acehnese, and Gayonese is also common.\n\n\nThe different linguistic communities in Medan communicate in a slang called *Bahasa Medan* or *Dialek Medan* (*Medanese slang*). This dialect of Indonesian includes loanwords from the various local languages, especially Malay.\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion of Medan – 2019 Census[41] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Islam |  | 65.78% |\n| Protestant |  | 20.14% |\n| Buddhism |  | 8.65% |\n| Catholic |  | 4.63% |\n| Hinduism |  | 0.79% |\n| Others |  | 0.01% |\n\nMost of Medan's inhabitants are Muslim, accounting for approximately 66 percent of the population. The substantial Christian demographic (about 25 percent of the total population) includes Catholics, Methodists, Lutherans, and the Batak Christian Protestant Church. Buddhists make up about 9 percent of the population, and there are smaller Hindu, Confucian, and Sikh communities. Some Bataknese follow traditional religions such as Pemena and Parmalim.\n\n\nGunung Timur Temple, on Jalan Hang Tuah, is Medan's oldest Taoist temple. Maha Vihara Maitreya, on Jalan Cemara Asri, is the largest Buddhist temple in southeast Asia. The city's oldest church, Medan Cathedral, on Jalan Pemuda, was originally built as *Indische Kerk* by the Dutch and Indian community. Sri Mariamman Temple, on Jalan Zainul Arifin in Kampung Madras, is the city's oldest Hindu temple, built around 1881; it is surrounded by over a hundred statues of various deities. Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni, a Catholic church in an Indo-Mogul style, was built on Jalan Sakura III in 2005, dedicated to a Marian apparition in 17th century Tamil Nadu.\n\n\n\n* ![Al-Osmani Mosque (Muslim)](image)\n\nAl-Osmani Mosque (Muslim)\n* ![Immanuel Church (Protestant)](image)\n\nImmanuel Church (Protestant)\n* ![Maha Vihara Maitreya (Buddhist)](image)\n\nMaha Vihara Maitreya (Buddhist)\n* ![Sri Mariamman Temple (Hindu)](image)\n\nSri Mariamman Temple (Hindu)\n* ![Gunung Timur Temple (Taoist)](image)\n\nGunung Timur Temple (Taoist)\n* ![Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni (Catholic)](image)\n\nGraha Maria Annai Velangkanni (Catholic)\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Belawan Container Terminal\nThe Medan metropolitan area was recognized as an Indonesian National Strategic Region (Indonesian: *Kawasan Strategis Nasional*) by Government Regulation No 28/2008. As a major commercial and economic hub of Indonesia, Medan is a centre for the production and trade of commodities including cinnamon, tobacco, tea, coffee, rubber, and palm oil. It also has a growing manufacturing sector, producing goods such as cars, machinery, tile, and paper and pulp.\n\n\nMedan's location makes it the main hub of international trade in western Indonesia, with exports going to Europe, North America, and the Middle East. Its trade and tourism businesses have also become essential to the Indonesia–Malaysia–Thailand Growth Triangle.[42] Many multinational companies maintain offices in the city, such as Asian Agri,[43] London Sumatra,[44] Musim Mas,[45] Philips Lighting, Toba Pulp Lestari, Marriott, Wilmar, ABB Group and DBS Bank. Rapid development in Medan has resulted in an upward trend in residential property prices.[46]\n\n\nMedan is one of the major shopping centres of Indonesia, along with Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya. Shopping malls in Medan include:\n\n\n\n* Cambridge City Square\n* Centre Point\n* DeliPark Mall\n* Focal Point\n* Lippo Plaza Mall\n* Manhattan Times Square\n* Medan Mall\n* Plaza Medan Fair\n* Ringroad City Walks\n* Sun Plaza\n* Thamrin Plaza\n\n## Cuisine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Food stall seller in *Jalan Selatpanjang*, Medan\nMedan is known as \"the culinary heaven of Indonesia\" for its variety of ethnic cuisines and prominent street hawkers. Prominent restaurants in Medan include *Nelayan* (halal-Chinese seafood and dim sum), *Garuda* and *Uda Sayang* (nasi padang and gulai), *Sate Afrizal Amir* (sate padang), *Cahaya Baru* (chapati and tandoori), *OnDo Batak grill* and *Tesalonika* (babi panggang (grilled pork) and saksang), *Jalan Selat Panjang* and *Jalan Semarang* (Chinese food), *Jalan Pagaruyung* (Indian and Malay food), and *Jalan Padan Bulan* (Batak food). Other major culinary destinations in Medan include Merdeka Walk, an outdoor area with a number of restaurants, and Pasar Rame, a daily outdoor market.[47]\n\n\nThe local cuisine in Medan comes from a variety of culinary traditions. Soto Medan is a savoury stew of mixed meats and coconut milk, usually served with rice and perkedel. Bika ambon, a popular local cake, is traditionally flavoured with pandanus, but can also be found in banana, durian, cheese, and chocolate flavours. Babi Panggang Karo, grilled pork dipped in blood curd, may be served with sambal andaliman made from local peppers. *Tau Kua He Ci* (豆干虾炸) is a local Chinese variant of rojak, made with fried prawn, vegetables, tofu, and chili sauce. Medanese swiss rolls (*Bolu Meranti*) and dried anchovies are popular souvenirs.\n\n\n\n## Tourism[edit]\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Medan and List of colonial buildings in Medan\n\n![](image)The Tjong A Fie Mansion\nMany examples of colonial Dutch architecture survive in Medan. Prominent instances include the old City Hall, the Medan Post Office, Inna Dharma Deli Hotel, Titi Gantung bridge, the Lonsum [id] building, the Tjong A Fie Mansion, the A.V.R.O.S. building, the Warenhuis building, and the Tirtanadi Water Tower.\n\n\nThe Sultan of Deli (whose position is now purely ceremonial) still lives in Maimoon Palace, built 1887-1891. The Great Mosque of Medan, built in 1906, was designed in a Moroccan style by the Dutch architect A.J. Dingemans.[48]\n\n\n\n### Theme parks[edit]\n\n\nAmong Medan's tourist attractions are several theme parks and water parks.\n\n\n\nHillPark GreenHill City[49]\nA relatively new theme park an hour from Medan.\nPantai Cermin Themepark\nA water theme park located in Cermin Beach, Serdang Bedagai.\nWonder Water World\nA water park in Medan itself, located in Central Business District Polonia.\nHairos Water Park\nA water park located near Medan in Deli Serdang.\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North Sumatra Museum\nThe North Sumatra Museum, located south of the city's centre, was formally opened in April 1982 by Daoed Joesoef [id], Minister of Education and Culture. The museum's collection centres around artefacts of North Sumatran ethnic groups.\n\n\nThe Bukit Barisan Museum is a military museum opened by Brigade General Leo Lopulisa [id] on 21 June 1971. Located at 8 Jalan H. Zainul Arifin, the museum houses a number of historic weapons used in the 1958 revolt in North Sumatra, and displays paintings of the rebellion against the Netherlands.[50]\n\n\nThe Rahmat International Wildlife Museum & Gallery, which opened in 1999, is considered the city's outstanding taxidermy collection. It is located on Jalan Letjen S. Parman No.309.[51]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kualanamu International Airport\n\n![](image)Kualanamu International Airport\nThe Kualanamu International Airport (KNO) opened on 25 July 2013 as a replacement for the Polonia Airport. Located 39 km (24 mi) from downtown Medan, it is Indonesia's first airport with a direct rail link to the city. The airport has a 224,298 m2 (2,414,324 sq ft) passenger terminal, and serves as a hub for Garuda Indonesia, Indonesia AirAsia, Lion Air, Susi Air and Wings Air,[52] with direct domestic flights to many major cities in Sumatra, as well as Java-international flights to locations abroad including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and Sri Lanka.\n\n\n\n### Seaport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Belawan\n\n![](image)The *Bandar Deli* terminal in Belawan\nThe Port of Belawan is on the northeast coast of Sumatra, 19 km (12 mi) north of Medan and accessible by a railway across the channel south of the island.[53] Originally built in 1890 for European tobacco exports, the harbour was expanded in 1907 with a new section for Chinese and indigenous traders.\n\n\nThe growth of northern Sumatra's rubber and palm oil plantations in the early twentieth century brought new developments to the port. Several major berthing facilities were built in the 1920s, and by 1938 the port handled the greatest cargo value of any in the Dutch East Indies. Trade volumes dropped substantially after Indonesian independence, but reached pre-independence levels again in the mid-1960s. A major restructuring in 1985 saw the construction of a container terminal; it almost immediately captured about one-fifth of Indonesia's containerized exports. Major products exported include rubber, palm oil, tea, and coffee.[54]\n\n\nThe current port has two terminals. The first, which handles passengers, offers ferry services to cities including Penang, Langkawi, Batam, Jakarta, and Surabaya. The second, Belawan International Container Terminal (BICT), is used for export and import services, and is one of the largest shipping industry ports in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### Roads[edit]\n\n\nMajor roads through Medan include the Trans-Sumatran Highway and the Belmera Toll Road. Other toll roads link the city to the airport, Binjai, and Tebing Tinggi.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Medan Station\n\n![](image)*Sri Lelawangsa* commuter rail departing from Medan station\n![](image)*Railink* Airport train in Medan station\nThe largest train station in Medan is Medan Station. The city also has a number of smaller stations, including Medan Pasar, Pulu Brayan, Titi Papan, Labuhan, and Belawan. Of these, Titi Papan and Pulu Brayan serve exclusively freight trains, while the others also serve passenger trains.\n\n\nExpress trains run between Medan and cities including Tebing Tinggi, Pematang Siantar, Tanjungbalai, and Rantau Prapat, and the Kualanamu Airport Railink Services express train runs between Medan Station and Kualanamu International Airport Station. Other rail lines connect Medan to cities such as Binjai and Belawan.\n\n\nAn elevated railway over several rail lines around Medan avoids level crossings and reduces traffic congestion.[55]\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Trans Metro Deli* Bus\nBoth auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are widely available in Medan, for a cheap pre-negotiated fare. Ride-sharing services Gojek and Grab are also in widespread use.\n\n\nWhile taxis exist, most locals use sudako, Medan's share taxi system. These minibuses follow routes indicated by numbers displayed on the vehicle; route maps are not published, instead typically being spread by word-of-mouth.\n\n\nMedan and its nearby urban areas have two bus rapid transit systems, **Trans Mebidang** and **Trans Metro Deli**, each with several active corridors.\n\n\n\n#### Trans Mebidang[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Corridor | Origin–Destination\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Medan – Binjai\n |\n| 2 | Medan – Lubuk Pakam\n |\n\n#### Trans Metro Deli[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Corridor | Origin–Destination\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Pinang Baris – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 2 | Amplas – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 3 | Belawan – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 4 | Medan Tuntungan – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n| 5 | Tembung – Lapangan Merdeka\n |\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nMedan's television stations include public and private national networks, as well as local channels.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000.

This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit. 'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kanttō earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*Tōkyō* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | 東京 |\n| Hiragana | とうきょう |\n| Katakana | トウキョウ |\n| Kyūjitai | 東亰 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | Tōkyō |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (江戸), a kanji compound of 江 (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and 戸 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (東京, from 東 *tō* \"east\", and 京 *kyō* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (京) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (京都), Keijō (京城), Beijing (北京), Nanjing (南京), and Xijing (西京)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"Tōkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, Ōta Dōkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kantō region. When he became *shōgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *shōgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Taitō-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c. 1930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943–1945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945–present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 – the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] – and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tennōzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7 m (786 ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (多摩地域) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000 km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (都), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (市 *-shi*), five towns (町 *-chō* or *machi*), and eight villages (村 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (特別区, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo – Chiyoda, Chūō and Minato – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017 m (6,617 ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737 m (5,699 ft)), Odake (1,266 m (4,154 ft)), and Mitake (929 m (3,048 ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850 km (1,150 mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu Ōshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, Kōzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachijō-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850 km (1,150 mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima. The islands form both Ogasawara Subprefecture and the village of Ogasawara, Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Flag, name w/o suffix | Full name\n | District orSubprefecture | Population\n | LPE code(w/o checksum)

Municipal mergers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsuryō[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Kyūryō, Hamura Kusabana Kyūryō, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Kyūryō Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000 km (1,243 mi)–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the Hōei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the Hōei eruption, the ash amount was 4 cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2 cm to 0.5 cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16 cm to 8 cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0 cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kantō Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400 mm (16 in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6–7% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3 km (3.9 mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72 ft) underground, with 70-meter (230 ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of Kōtō, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Taitō and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9 °C (80.4 °F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4 °C (41.7 °F). The record low temperature was −9.2 °C (15.4 °F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5 °C (103.1 °F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3 °C (86.5 °F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30 °C (86.0 °F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0 in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30 in) of rain,[73] including 270.5 mm (10.65 in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5 mm (34.63 in) in 1984 to 2,229.6 mm (87.78 in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n | −7.9(17.8)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | −0.5(31.1)\n | −3.1(26.4)\n | −6.8(19.8)\n | −9.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point °C (°F)\n | −5(23)\n | −4(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | −1(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985–2015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580 billion yen ($5.5 billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000 ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88 ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436 ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000 ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000.

This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Chūō, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4 million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2 trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81 million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4 trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of Kōtō ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachijō-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu Ōshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kantō region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunkyō\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Chōfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuchū) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuchū).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* São Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.
